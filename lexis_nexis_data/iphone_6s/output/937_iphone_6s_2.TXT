Google, the Nexus 6P, tech geniuses are now comparing this outstanding device to
the Apple's iPhone 6s. Huawei's latest smart phone Nexus 6P has undoubtedly,
proven to be a great competition to high-tier smart phones. Nexus 6P has loaded
in it numerous amazing and unique features in comparison to iPhone 6s. For one,
the battery of Nexus is twice more powered than that of Apple iPhone, moreover,
the CPU clocking of Nexus is more speeded up with 1.8 GHz Octa-Core as compared
to dual-core 2GHz CPU processor of Apple iPhone.

In terms of pixel density the display of Nexus 6P is larger and has better
resolution, about 1.5 times greater than that of iPhone 6s' 326ppi. The 5.7
inches display size of Nexus makes it more of a phablet, whereas, the size of
Apple iPhone 6s is 4.7 inches. Certain users prefer to have big screen phones,
in order to get more enhanced video watching experience, although with such a
big screen, like that of Nexus, users would need to use both their hands for
handling the device.
