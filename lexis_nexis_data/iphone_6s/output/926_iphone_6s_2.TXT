6s and 6S Plus as inventories of the smartphone pile up.

Asian companies that make parts for the devices told Japanese financial
newspaper Nikkei that they expected Apple would change its plans to keep
production of the devices at the same level that its predecessors - the iPhone 6
and 6 Plus - were at a year earlier.

Sales of the devices, which were launched in September, hit a record 13 million
in their first three days on the market, but it is thought demand has since
tailed off.

Research from Accenture indicates that smartphone demand in general is on the
wane: 48% of the 28,000 consumers it polled said they planned to buy a
smartphone this year, down six percentage points on last year.

Nikkei said the 6S and 6S Plus were still well-stocked in retailers across
China, Japan, Europe and the US as customers found they were little improved
from the earlier versions. The strong dollar was also weighing as prices leapt
in emerging markets.

However, Analyst Daniel Ives of FBR & Co has said the fears about the effects of
the sales slowdown as well as the economic woes of key market China on Apple are
overblown.

He acknowledged it was a "turbulent" time for the company, but believes the
company will still hit forecasts for iPhone sales.

Nevertheless, the Nikkei report hit the shares of UK company ARM which provides
chips for the phones. It was down 3.5% at 968p and was one of the FTSE 100's
biggest losers in early trading.
