lowest storage variant and as much . 92,000 for the top-end model, as '
distributors said Thursday. The India prices are much higher than those in
overseas markets such as the US and Singapore, which may deter buyers,
especially those intending to upgrade from iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, experts
said.

The latest phones, which have

been offered for astronomical prices on websites such as eBay India, Quikr, Olx
and Flipkart since the US launch on September 25, will be available for
pre-registration at Apple's local distributor websites, including Brightstar,
besides online portals Paytm and

tals Paytm and Snapdeal.

The 16 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB variants of the iPhone 6s will be sold . 62,000, '
for ' . 72,000 and '. 82,000, respectively , and similar versions of the 6s Plus
will cost ' . 72,000, . 82,000 and ' ' . 92,000. In the US, the cheapest iPhone
6s is listed on Apple's website for $649 (. '42,235) while the same model on its
Singapore website can be purchased for S$1,048 (. '8,295). ET was the first to
report the prices last week, which have now been confirmed. The new models in
India are 14-16% more expensive than the devices launched last year.

"Globally, pricing remained similar to last year's models, but a strong dollar
led to increase in pricing in certain regions this year...India, not being a
highvolume country for Apple, the increase in pricing might be a result of weak
rupee and rise in duty compared to last year," said Tarun Pathak, a senior
analyst at Counterpoint Technology Market Research.

"It might deflect some buyers to the older iPhone 6 variant, which might undergo
a price cut too along with other older models," Pathak said.
