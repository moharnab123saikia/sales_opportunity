Goldgenie has confirmed that the pre order for the Gold iPhone 6s to open by
August 31st, even though there areÂ two weeks left for Apple to make the official
announcement for the latest iPhone 6s.

The London based luxury gift and specialist gold-plating company has expressed
interest for offering the iPhone 6s in 24K Gold, Rose Gold and Platinum as well,
as soon as the phone is launched. The company has announced that a pre order
will be open on August 31st, where it will accept 50 percent advance for the
luxury editions.

According to an interview with Amjad Ali, CEO of Gold & Co London with Emirates
24|7 last year, UAE is the biggest market for the luxury edition of the phone.
The local order book is insane, with pre-orders coming in for six months, said
Ali.

Goldgenie has announced that "Customers will also be able to have their luxury
customized iPhone 6s personalized with a laser engraving of their choice". The
company will be selling the iPhone 6s on its own, or as a gift set, with a
matching customized Apple Watch. Customers can register with Goldgenie in order
to stay up to date with any news about the collection. A rough estimate shows
the bespoke version of the devices to cost around AED15,225.

The interesting thing is, Apple is yet to confirm if there even is an iPhone 6s,
and if so, its specifications and dimensions.
