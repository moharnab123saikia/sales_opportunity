its new iPhones -- iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus -- in the US.

SIM-free iPhones are 'unlocked' iPhones which do not include the usual
carrier-specific nano-SIM card. As such, the SIM-free iPhones are not locked to
a specific carrier or multi-year carrier contracts; and customers can get their
own card from their preferred carrier.

Announcing the availability of SIM-free new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus
handsets in the US, Apple said that the SIM-free version of the iPhone 6S is
designated A1633; while the model number carried by the larger iPhone 6S Plus is
A1634.

According to the details shared by Apple in its fine print, the SIM-free units
of iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will work on a number of US wireless networks
including the AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint networks.

The fine print has also revealed that since the SIM-free iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S
Plus units will not be eligible for carrier incentives or payment plans, the
entire cost of the handsets will have to paid upfront by the customers.

About the advantage of SIM-free iPhones, Apple said: "If you don't want a
multiyear service contract, or if you prefer to use a local carrier when
traveling abroad, the SIM-free iPhone is the best choice."
