has appeared on Chinese social media website Weibo.

The alleged leak confirms 'iPhone SE' as the name of the upcoming Apple
smartphone and a version with 16GB onboard storage. The leaked image also shows
the phone supports NFC for Apple Pay.

According to earlier reports, iPhone 4SE's rear camera will support 4K videos
and is tipped to sport 8MP camera setup (similar to iPhone 6's).

The company's iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S plus models, launched last year, also
offer support for 4K videos. The small-screen iPhone is said to be powered by
the current flagship's A9 chipset. It will also support features like Apple Pay
and Live Photos but not 3D Touch, which will remain exclusive to iPhone 6S and
6S Plus for now.

iPhone 4SE is speculated to come in silver, space grey, gold and rose gold
colour options.
