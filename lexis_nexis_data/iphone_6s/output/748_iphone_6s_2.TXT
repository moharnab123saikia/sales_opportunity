not have long to wait.

According to new rumours, Apple is set to reveal its next version of the iPhone
and iPad on September 9th, 2015 - less than a month away.

As ever, the next-generation gadgets are shrouded in secrecy, but some believe
the iPhone 6S (as it's likely to be called) will be thicker than the current
iPhone.

However, it is expected to feature the same "force touch" technology that Apple
developed for the Apple Watch.

Last year's iPhone announcement was held on September 9 and, according to
sources speaking to BuzzFeed, the company is planning a repeat performance.

"The company intends to hold a special event the week of Sept. 7, with Wednesday
the 9th being the most likely date," wrote BuzzFeed's John Paczkowski.

Alongside the iPhone 6S, Apple is also expected to reveal the iPhone 6S Plus and
potentially an iPhone 6C.

The company could also show off a giant, 12-inch iPad that industry watchers
have dubbed the "iPad Pro".

Apple has declined to comment on the rumours.

Historically, the company waits until a few weeks before its announcement to
send out cryptic invitations.

Are you going to get an iPhone 7?
