Samsung's latest S7 and S7 Edge may be waterproof, but they are not quite
sturdy.

According to SquareTrade, a company that focuses on extended protection plans
for gadgets, the Samsung S7 and S7 Edge may be more waterproof than the iPhone
6S, but might not take a fall as well as the 6S would. The company did a couple
of torture tests with the phones. When submerged in water, the Samsung S7 and S7
Edge functioned well, however the audio was permanently muffled and distorted,
while the iPhones did not fare so well. Although, the Samsung S7 and S7 Edge
were not designed to be used underwater, as the users have to wait for the
screen to dry before they use it.

With a drop test, it was revealed that the Samsung phones were more prone to
breaking than the iPhone 6S. Both the Samsung phones cracked when dropped onto
the sidewalk, but the Apple phones only had cosmetic damage. When put through a
tumbling test chamber, which is designed to mimic repeated drops, both the
Samsung phones had a lot of damage on the back and minor cracks on the screen.
The iPhone 6S had similar results, but the 6S Plus completely shattered.

When asked about this, a Samsung spokeswoman at Samsung Electronics in Seoul,
South Korea, did not immediately respond to a request for a comment, but said
that the company is looking into it.

SquareTrade is known for its protection plans which covers accidental drops in
toilets, bathtubs, exposure to rain, pools and oceans as well as other dangerous
contaminants such as chlorine and salt.
