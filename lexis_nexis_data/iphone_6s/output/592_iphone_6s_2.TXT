chip than others.

While it was rumoured that Apple's new A9 chip that powers the iPhone 6S and 6S
Plus was sourced from two different chipmakers - Samsung and TSMC (Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), some video reviewers are reporting that
iPhones powered by TSMC made chip offers better battery backup.

Video reviewers Austin Evans and Jonathan Morrison have uploaded videos
comparing TSMC and Samsung powered models against each other and found that the
TSMC-powered unit was more efficient. After shooting and exporting a 10 minute
4K video with the two phones at 100% battery, Morrison found that the TSMC unit
had 62% battery left while the Samsung one had 55%. After repeating the test the
models had 24% and 10% battery.

Evans tested the phones with the Geekbench 3 battery test with 100% brightness
on both units. He found that the TSMC chip-powered iPhone 6S lasted 50 minutes
longer than the Samsung chip-powered model. The reviewer also noted that the
TSMC model ran at a cooler temperature. However, streaming videos resulted in
similar performance and there was just a 1% difference in battery consumption
between the two.

It's worth mentioning that real world performance could be different and most
users may not feel any difference. It's also not possible for users to know the
manufacturer of the chip before purchasing the iPhone. The only way is to run
some hardware tests or use an app like Lirum after setting up the phone.

However, it's expected that Apple, like any other device maker, should ensure
that all iPhone 6S units offer the same performance and battery life
irrespective of the component maker.
