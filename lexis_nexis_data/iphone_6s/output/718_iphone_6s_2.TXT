week, but it seems consumers certainly haven't.

The tech giant is predicting that sales of the latest version of its flagship
iPhone - the 6S and 6S Plus - will hit a record when they start shipping next
week.

The company said it is likely that more than 10 million units will be snapped up
in their first weekend, beating the record set last year by predecessors the
iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

Unlike previous iPhones' opening weekends, Chinese customers will be able to buy
the device, which has a better camera and faster operating system, at the same
time as those elsewhere, a factor that should provide an extra sales boost.

Apple starting taking preorders for the smartphones on Saturday and will begin
sending them out to customers on September 25.

The iPhone 6S Plus has so far proven particularly popular and it said it is
working to catch up with demand.

"Preorders this weekend were very strong around the world," Apple spokeswoman
Trudy Muller said in a statement.

Apple also unveiled a new version of its iPad, the iPad Pro, a revamped Apple TV
and other devices at its special event in San Francisco last week.

Shares fell around 2% after the announcement as analysts questioned Apple's
ability to continue innovating.
