Man plans to sell kidney for iPhone 6s

Many have joked about selling their kidneys for Apple products, but for two
young men in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, it was more than a joke. They actually
contacted an illegal agent to sell their kidneys, reported Modern Express on
Tuesday.

One of the men, surnamed Wu, wanted an iPhone 6s but couldn't afford it. His
friend Huang suggested they sell a kidney each for money.

The two then found an illegal agent on the Internet who asked them to take
medical examinations in a hospital in Nanjing. However, when they arrived on
Sept 12, the agent didn't appear as scheduled.

After calming down later that day, Wu reconsidered selling his organ. He told
his friend to stop the plan but Huang wouldn't listen. Wu then called the police
but Huang ran away and has been out of reach ever since.
