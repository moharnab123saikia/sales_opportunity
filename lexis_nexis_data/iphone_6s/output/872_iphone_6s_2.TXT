

Apple has unveiled the iPhone 6S and 6S plus, the latest in its line of flagship
smart phones, as well as a new larger iPad and a new TV system.

Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the new devices during an Apple media event held in
California on Wednesday. The new phones come with a new 3D touch technology that
has different responses depending on the amount of pressure applied to the
screen.

Both new models will be available in four metal finishes and will boast an
improved 12-megapixel camera and will be capable of 4K video recording.
