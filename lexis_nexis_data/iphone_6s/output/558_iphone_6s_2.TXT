

Apple's newest phone is available to pre-order this morning but you'll have to
wait almost two weeks before you get your hands on it.

The smartphone is available to pre-order from 8.01am.

The new phone comes in two models: the 4.7-inch iPhone 6s and the 5.5-inch
iPhone 6s Plus.

Although they won't go on sale until September 25, you can stake your claim on
the hot new gadget today.

Sadly, they don't come cheap.

Apple has kept the pricing the same as it was for your last year's phones.

The 16GB SIM-free version of the iPhone 6s will set you back (EURO)649, while
the SIM-free 64GB version costs (EURO)759.

That increases if you decide to go for the larger iPhone 6s Plus, which starts
with a SIM-free price of (EURO)759 for the 16GB version and the SIM-free 64GB
model is (EURO)869.

That doesn't seem to have dissuaded some people, as Apple fans are ALREADY
queuing up to be the first to get their hands on the new phone.

A reporter for tech website CNET tweeted a picture of a tent pitched outside
Apple's Sydney store last night, before the new devices had even been announced.

And it's not the first time this has happened.

Ten days ahead of the release of the iPhone 6 in 2014, people were queueing up
outside Apple's Regent Street store - in the hope they'd be able to sell their
place in line for cash.

We're sure the lines will be back again this year, but will you be among them?
