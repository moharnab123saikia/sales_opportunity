

TECH fans were out in force today to get their hands on the latest Apple gadget.

The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus launched today in 12 countries - and customers
started queuing last night and early this morning to avoid missing out.

In Glasgow, the new devices were due to go on sale at the city's Buchanan Street
branch at 8am - and fans were eager to buy one.

In German cities, including Hamburg and Munich, fans began queuing the night
before the launch.

The iPhone 6s is already the 足second most popular phone, based on pre-orders and
searches on  http://uSwitch.com.

The new rose gold colour option is the most popular among  those who've
pre-ordered it.

And its sizeable sibling, the  iPhone 6s Plus, is currently the 10th most
popular phone.

This time last year, the iPhone 6 flew straight into the smartphone charts at
number one upon 足release, and Apple's latest model is poised to do exactly the
same thing.

Demand for Apple's iPhone 5c is still high - it's currently in sixth place -
despite its removal from Apple's own website for sale ahead of the launch of the
6s and 6s Plus.

Ernest Doku, technology expert at http://uSwitch.com, said: "It never fails to
impress that Apple can stamp its authority on the mobile market with nothing
more than a live-streamed keynote speech.

"The early popularity of the 足iPhone 6s shows people have no problems investing
in Apple 足off-plan. Not even last year's 'bendgate' - when some new owners found
that keeping their phones in their pockets resulted in a curved handset - has
put people off being among the first to own the latest iPhone.

"With queues already starting to form outside Apple's stores, and staggering
social media hype too, it won't be long until the iPhone 6s rocks to the top of
the list."
