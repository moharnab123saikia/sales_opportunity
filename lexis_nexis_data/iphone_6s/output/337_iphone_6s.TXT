complained that iPhone 6s smartphones made with Samsung processors perform worse
than those made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).
Following the release of the new iPhone 6s, it has come to light that Apple had
dual-sourced its A9 processors for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus from both Samsung
and its rival TSMC. The difference between the two versions continues to be a
point of debate.
¿They are not created equal,¿ said tech journalist Andy Patrizio, writing on his
blog on IT World.com.
Users have found the TSMC chip had eight hours of battery life, while Samsung
had six hours. In addition, some lab results have shown the TSMC chip is faster
and runs cooler than the Samsung processor.
Some users said on the Internet that they were insisting on ¿TSMC only,¿ while
another user remarked, ¿If I get the Samsung version, I might as well buy a
Samsung phone.¿ However, there are others that don't find the difference too
significant, since they would ¿say goodbye¿ to the model in a year anyway.
Some Hong Kong media said the two chips appear to be unequally distributed
around the world ¿ Almost 60 per cent of iPhone 6s models sold in the United
States and Japan were made with the TSMC chips, while over 60 per cent of chips
in Hong Kong were provided by Samsung. As for Taiwan, over 80 per cent of iPhone
6s¿s allegedly run on Samsung chips.
It is not evident by looking at the packaging whether it Samsung or TSMC
supplied the processor for an individual iPhone, nor do serial codes or barcodes
offer any clues. Developers have created apps that can detect which chip your
phone operates on, such as the ¿CPU Identifier¿ offered online, free of charge.

Apple issued a statement on October 9, ¿Our testing and customer data show the
actual battery life of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, even taking into
account variable component differences, vary within just 2-3 per cent of each
other.¿ Apple rebutted previous lab tests, indicating such tests were conducted
under battery-straining conditions that would be deemed ¿unrealistic¿ for
real-world use.
Amid user complaints and online debate, both Samsung and TSMC have declined to
comment on the subject.
Hong Kong media has speculated that Apple would cut down on chip orders from
Samsung in the future, and industry analysts predict that TSMC would likely gain
an upper hand in a coming deal with Apple, allowing it to become the exclusive
supplier for Apple¿s A10 processors.
