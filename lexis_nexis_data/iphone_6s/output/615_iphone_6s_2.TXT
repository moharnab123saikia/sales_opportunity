The iPhone 6S is almost identical in size to the iPhone 6 but when you're taking
your phone underwater that "almost" can make a big difference.

In most cases, a case that will fit an iPhone 6 will also fit an iPhone 6S. That
is because the newer 6S is just 0.2mm thicker than its predecessor.

But with waterproof cases, depending on the design, that extra thickness can
make a difference.

You can fit your iPhone 6S into an old Lifeproof 6 case but Lifeproof says you
shouldn't. Although the case closes, and is probably as dustproof and drop proof
as ever, the extra thickness of the phone adds pressure to the seal and could
affect the case's ability to be waterproof.

It's a fraction larger to account for the extra phone's thickness but you won't
notice that with the naked eye.

The one major difference, and it's a handy one, is the hole for the Lightning
charging cable is now larger, making it more likely that non-Apple charging
cords will fit with the case.

Being the Fre design, it has a clear plastic screen on the front but that
doesn't stop the use of Touch 3D.

It still has the waterproof, dustproof and drop-proof standards that have made
Lifeproof the standard other tough cases aspire to meet.$100 / LIFEPROOF.COM
