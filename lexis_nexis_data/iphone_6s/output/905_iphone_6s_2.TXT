

SHARES in the world's most-valuable company, Apple, and those in many of its
component suppliers, tumbled today on claims that it is cutting production of
its latest iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus by 30% for the next three months.

Apple shares closed down 2.5% at $102.71 (Â£70.16) in after-hours trading on the
Nasdaq market in New York following the report by Japan's Nikkei Asian Review.
It said stocks of the 6s were piling up with retailers, particularly in
developed smartphone markets like Europe and China.

The shares of London-listed Apple suppliers suffered knock-on effects with chip
maker ARM down 3.1%, Imagination Technologies down 1.5%, and Laird off 1.7%. Far
Eastern suppliers of parts for iPhones like Japan Display, LG Display and TDK
Corp saw their shares fall between 3% and 4%.

"This is an eye-opening production cut which speaks to the softer demand that
Apple has seen with 6s out of the gate," said Daniel Ives, senior analyst at FBR
Capital Markets. "Wall Street was bracing for a cut but the magnitude is a bit
more worrisome and speaks to a soft March quarter on the horizon."

Apple declined to comment on the report but one Taiwanese supplier pointed out
that the main iPhone assembler, Foxconn, was allowing workers time off at
Chinese New Year in February whereas it used to pay them overtime to keep
production running through the holiday. @NickGoodway
