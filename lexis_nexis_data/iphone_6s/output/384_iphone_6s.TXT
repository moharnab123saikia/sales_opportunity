

Sept. 24 -- If you purchase either the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus with
Verizon's Device Payment option beginning Friday, September 25, you'll be
eligible to get a new iPhone every year.  Yes, no more waiting for your contract
to end.  Now you can always have the latest iPhone - on the network that has the
largest 4G LTE coverage in America.

The new program allows you to turn in your phone and upgrade to a new iPhone
every year. If you pre-ordered an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, you're
automatically enrolled in this program if you've elected the Device Payment
option.

If you're not interested in upgrading, you still have the option to pay your
phone off in 24 low monthly payments.  That's a better option than those "lease
plans" offered by other companies, which can include surprise balloon payments
just 18 months into your agreement, or ask you to turn over your phone without
getting anything for it.

Not with Verizon and thinking about joining America's largest and most reliable
4G LTE network? You can get up to $400 when you switch and trade in your old
smartphone. Check out the details here: www.verizonwireless.com/iphone.

Now you can always have the latest iPhone on the network that has the largest 4G
LTE coverage in America.  Because the best deserves the best.

Beginning Friday, September 25, you can buy iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus at
Verizon retail stores and online at www.verizonwireless.com. For complete
details on pricing, please visit www.verizonwireless.com/iphone. For more
