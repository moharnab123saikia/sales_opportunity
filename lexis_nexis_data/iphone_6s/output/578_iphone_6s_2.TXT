Samsung's brand new Galaxy Note 7 in a speed test, despite being nearly a year
older.

In a video by YouTube user Phone Buff , the two phones are shown performing a
series of tasks, including launching apps and rendering video.

Both phones go through two laps of the app test under timed conditions.

The iPhone 6s quickly takes the lead, and even ends up "lapping" the Galaxy Note
7, with a finishing time of one 1 minute 51 seconds, compared to 2 minutes 49
seconds for the Samsung handset.

The test results may come as a surprise to some, as - on paper at least - the
Galaxy Note 7 is the superior device.

Samsung's smartphone features a 14-nanometer Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core
64-bit processor and 4GB RAM - which make the iPhone 6s ' dual-core A9 processor
and 2GB RAM look fairly meagre.

However, as the test proves, specs aren't everything, and the close integration
of Apple's hardware and software appears to give the iPhone a significant
advantage over most of its Android competitors.

In other respects, however, the Galaxy Note 7 has a lot to offer. The new jumbo
smartphone features a stunning 5.7-inch edge-to-edge display, a 12-megapixel
camera, waterproofing, and wireless charging.

It also has an in-built iris scanner, meaning you can open the device from the
lock screen almost instantly by simply looking at its front-facing camera.

Meanwhile, Apple is gearing up for the launch of its iPhone 7 at the beginning
of September.

The new handset is likely to look almost identical to the iPhone 6s. However, it
is expected to feature a dual lens camera , twin external speakers, a
pressure-sensitive Home button and more discrete antenna lines .

Controversially, Apple is also planning to remove the headphone jack , according
to reports, suggesting that users will have to rely on wireless headphones or
buy new ones with a Lightning connector.
