A pair of rumors earlier this week both point to Apple releasing its next-gen
iPhone on Friday, September 18.

First off, the Japanese language blog ITHome reports that Apple's big iPhone
unveiling event is set to take place on Wednesday, September 9. This of course
jibes with a previous report which pegged September 9 as the date of a big Apple
event. The report further adds that iPhone 6s preorders will open up on Friday,
September 11 to soon be followed by a worldwide launch seven days later on
September 18.

While Apple hasn't yet made anything official via its traditional event
invitations, the dates above sure do fit Apple's historic pattern of iPhone
releases over the last few years.

Echoing ITHome's report, the German-language Macerkopf also relays that Apple is
eyeing September 18 as a launch date for the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus.

As the old saying goes, when there's smoke there's fire, which is to say it's a
pretty good bet that you can pencil in September 18 as a day you might want to
keep open.

As we've covered previously, Apple is reportedly planning to unveil more than
just two new iPhone models come September 9. Specifically, it's widely believed
that Apple will also take some time to unveil a refreshed iPad lineup --
including the rumored iPad Pro -- alongside a completely revamped Apple TV.

While Apple's long-rumored TV subscription service is reportedly on hold for the
time being, an Apple TV refresh has not only been a long time coming, but is
apparently coming at just the right time. To wit, a recent report from Park
Associates finds that the Apple TV is now the fourth most popular streaming
media device in the U.S., trailing behind Roku, Google Chromecast, and Amazon's
Fire TV. Previously, the Apple TV checked in at third before being overtaken by
Amazon.
