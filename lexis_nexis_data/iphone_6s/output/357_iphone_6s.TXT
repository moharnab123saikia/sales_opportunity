 $658 (16GB), $828 (64GB)

The Apple iPhone SE is basically an iPhone 5s updated with the innards of the
iPhone 6s.

On the outside, the SE looks exactly the same as the iPhone 5s, with the same
button placement, such as the round volume buttons on the left hand side and the
power/wake button on the top right.

But inside, the SE packs a much faster A9 processor, an updated M9 motion
co-processor and a better 12-megapixel rear camera than the one found in the
iPhone 5s.

So, you are getting the faster speed and better graphics performance of the
iPhone 6s, but in a smaller form factor.

On the downside, the iPhone SE still uses the first-generation Touch ID found in
iPhone 5s. This means it is a tad slower than the iPhone 6sduring unlocking (by
around 0.5sec).

The SE's 4-inch display has the same 1,136 x 640 pixels resolution as the iPhone
5s, but without 3D Touch support. However, the SE's camera is still able to
shoot 4K videos and Live Photos as well as 63-megapixel panoramic shots. In
terms of image quality, it is on par with the iPhone 6s.

But the SE's front-facing camera stays 1.2-megapixel instead of being updated to
the 5-megapixel camera found on iPhone 6s. So, images of selfies and FaceTime
Web chats continue to look "low-res".

If you prefer a small iPhone, then the iPhone SE has to be your pick. But it is
by no means mid-range when it comes to the 64GB model.
