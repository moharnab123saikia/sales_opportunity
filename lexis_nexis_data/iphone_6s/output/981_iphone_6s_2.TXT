tonight. Here's how you can catch the live stream.

Apple is hosting its second event of the year In San Francisco on Sept 9, and
the goodies are expected to flow. So in case you can't watch the event from an
auditorium seat at the venue, join us HERE as we cover it on our liveblog in
real time. Otherwise, here's how you can watch the event live.

The straight and narrow

As usual, Apple users can get access to the live stream, no problem. However,
it's limited to those running Safari on an iOS device with iOS 7 or  later, a
Mac with OS X 10.8.5 or later and Safari 6.0.5 or later, and second or third
generation Apple TVs with software version 6.2 or later. This time though,
getting access will also be a whole lot easier for a number of Windows users as
well. For the first time in many years, Apple's live stream is also open to
Windows 10 users, through Microsoft's Edge browser. Thanks to added support in
their new web browser, you can experience the sacrilege of watching an Apple
event on a Windows system (oooh, sinful).

The sneaky-beaky

Now, if you don't own an Apple device, and you don't have Windows 10, it's not
game over for you just yet. You can also access the live stream through good old
freeware. Just download VLC Media Player (if you don't already have it),
available for Windows, Linux, and Android (also Mac). Once it's open, select
"Open Media", open the Network tab, and paste in the URL for Apple's live
stream. You're going to have to wait until the stream begins to get the URL so
be patient.

The stream is set to launch at 10:30 pm IST (10 am PT). And remember, Apple's
live streams have gone bonkers in the past, so don't be too upset if it comes
crashing down around you. If you still need your fix though, we're also doing a
live blog as the event unfolds, so you can catch all the action there.
