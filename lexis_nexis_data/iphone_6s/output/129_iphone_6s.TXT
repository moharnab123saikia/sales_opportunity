We reported last week that despite the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus only being
available on the international market, they were still making their way to the
Indian grey market, for a highly marked up price. Interestingly enough, those
same sellers preempted the launch of Google's new Nexus 5X an 6P smartphones by
dropping that price last night.

You can now buy the iPhone 6s at Rs 65,000 for the 16GB, Rs 75,000 for the 64GB,
and Rs 90,000 for the 128GB, Meanwhile, the iPhone 6s Plus is now available on
the grey market at Rs 90,000 for the 64GB, and Rs 1,10,000 for the 128GB, there
have reportedly been no takers for the 16GB iPhone 6s Plus.

The sellers, it seems, have realised that the popularity of Google's Nexus
series erode the justification for marked up iPhones, as well as the fact the
the iPhone will be available in India Oct 17, starting at Rs 53,500 for the 16GB
iPhone 6s, and Rs 62,500 for the 16GB iPhone 6s Plus.
