everyday apps unusable.

The glitch appears to have affected people who upgraded from an iPhone 5, 5s or
5c and causes some apps to appear zoomed-in on the larger display.

The bloated display means that some buttons are pushed off the side of the
screen, ruining the functionality.

Apps that are affected include Wallet, Weather, Watch, Health and Caluclator.

Those that have been hit appear to have used Apple's iCloud backup to transfer
their settings and content across from the older iPhones.

"I can't activate any cards since the button to input the activation codes is
seemingly cut off. So Apple Pay is useless with this bug, it's not just
cosmetic," wrote one disgruntled user on Apple's discussion forum .

Another added: "Apple's QC on usability issues is just getting dismal. I really
hate to say it (because I got sick of people saying it years ago), but I believe
Steve would have had heads rolling for crap like this by now. Really getting
tired of this stuff."

While Apple hasn't commented on the bug, according to Macrumors is believed to
be aware of the issue and is working on an update to fix it.

To avoid the issue completely requires setting your new iPhone 6s up as a brand
new device. Unfortunately, you'll lose data from your older iPhone.

The existence of the bug doesn't appear to have hurt Apple's credibility too
much though.

It was announced this morning that the company is the world's most valuable
brand for the third year running and is worth an estimated Â£112 billion.
