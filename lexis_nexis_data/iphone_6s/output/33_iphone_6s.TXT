

Along with the unveiling of its next-generation iPhones - iphone 6S and iPhone
6S Plus - at a September 9 event, tech giant Apple also announced its new lease
program for the two handsets.

The shipping of the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus handsets is set to commence
on Friday, September 25. The cost of the iPhone 6S will begin at $199
contract-free for the 16GB model; while the cost of the 16GB model of the iPhone
6S Plus handset will be $299.

The leasing program - the new 'Iphone Upgrade Program' - has been introduced by
Apple for the first time, to enable customers to switch their smartphones even
if they do not have the required cash upfront.

Under the new iPhone leasing option, Apple allows customers to exchange their
old handsets with a new iPhone when it is launched. Customers can upgrade to the
new iPhone by paying an amount of between $32.41 and $44.91 per month, depending
on the model they want to purchase. The monthly payment for the iPhone 6S Plus
under the lease program begins at $36.58.

The leasing option for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus handsets is available only
at Apple's retail stores in the US. Customers leasing their preferred handset
model can select a phone carrier and get an unlocked device, with the
"opportunity" to upgrade to a new iPhone on a yearly basis as well as benefit
from the AppleCare+ protection program.
