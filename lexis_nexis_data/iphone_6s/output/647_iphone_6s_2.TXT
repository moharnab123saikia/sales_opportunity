a robot - lining up in Sydney to kick off a global sales cycle that will be
scrutinized for signs of how much juice Apple Inc's marquee product has left.

Analysts expect 12 million to 13 million phones to fly off the shelves in the
first weekend, up from more than 10 million last year when the hugely successful
iPhone 6's launch was delayed in China, the world's biggest smartphone market.

Among the first to pick up the new iPhone 6s in a cold, rainy Sydney was a
telepresence robot named Lucy, operated by marketing executive Lucy Kelly.

"I obviously have my work and other things to attend to and can't spend two days
lining up so my boss at work suggested I take one of the robots down and use it
to stand in my place," she said via an iPad mounted on top of the wheeled robot.

Fans from San Francisco to London to Sydney have camped out for days before the
release, and Apple said earlier this month that pre-orders suggested sales were
on pace to beat last year's first-weekend performance.

The phones, which are the same size as last year's models, feature improved
cameras and 3-D touch, a display technology that responds according to how hard
users press their screens.

"Today is like Christmas for pocket film makers all around the world because the
iPhone 6s Plus is like the newest, greatest toy we have to play with," said
Jason van Genderen, who makes movies on smartphones in Sydney.

The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which start at $199 and $299 with a two-year contract
with a mobile service provider, go on sale on Friday in Australia, Canada,
China, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, the United
Kingdom and the United States.
