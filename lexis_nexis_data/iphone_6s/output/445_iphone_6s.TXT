offer better battery life than the ones powered by Samsung-made chip, Apple has
said that there's a negligible difference of 2%-3% in battery life between
distinct units irrespective of the component source.

In a statement issued to several websites including ArsTechnica, Apple said that
lab tests which run the processors with a continuous heavy workload until the
battery depletes are not representative of real-world usage and are a misleading
way to test the battery life.

"With the Apple-designed A9 chip in your iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus," an Apple
spokesperson told iMore, "you are getting the most advanced smartphone chip in
the world. Every chip we ship meets Apple's highest standards for providing
incredible performance and deliver great battery life, regardless of iPhone 6s
capacity, color, or model.

Certain manufactured lab tests which run the processors with a continuous heavy
workload until the battery depletes are not representative of real-world usage,
since they spend an unrealistic amount of time at the highest CPU performance
state. It's a misleading way to measure real-world battery life. Our testing and
customer data show the actual battery life of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus,
even taking into account variable component differences, vary within just 2-3%
of each other."

Earlier, some video reviewers had reported that iPhones powered by TSMC made A9
chip were offering better battery backup. The reviewers had run benchmark tests
and recorded 4K video under similar conditions to test battery performance.

The A9 chip that powers the iPhone 6S is designed by Apple but manufacturing is
done by Samsung and TSMC.
