

As expected, Apple have unveiled the latest model of the iPhone at their event
in San Francisco - the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, described by Apple CEO Tim Cook as
"the most advanced iPhones we've ever created".

The latest version of the smartphone promises that, while the new phone is not
the iPhone 7, "the only thing that's different is everything". As well as a new
'Rose Gold' (aka pink) version, the 6S comes with new features including '3D
Touch', and a highly advanced camera.

3D Touch functions as a sort of 'right-click' feature - sensors in the iPhone S6
are able to interpret the amount of force that users exert on the screen and
offers new gestures and functionality depending on how hard the touchscreen is
pressed.
