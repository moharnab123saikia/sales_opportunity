

The UK has been named as one of the most expensive places to buy the upcoming
Apple iPhone 6S, which was announced at a glittering event last week.

Rip-off Britain has been placed near the very top of a global price list, with
only France and Germany facing higher prices.

This shocking map shows Americans have access to the cheapest iPhones and will
fork out just $649 for a basic 6S with 16gb of memory.

The same phone will cost Brits $832.73, German people will pay $835.24 and their
French neighbours will have to shell out $846.54.

However, the price of the iPhone has remained stable in the UK, whilst it has
shot up in European nations due to the poor performance of the euro over the
past year.

If you're looking to fly over to America to buy a new phone, you should probably
heed these sage words of wisdom.

Anyone picking up an iPhone in North America may have to pay additional local
sales taxes, as well as VAT when they arrive back on British shores - as long as
you declare it when you get into the country.

In Britain, the 16GB SIM-free version of the iPhone 6s will set you back £539.
The SIM-free 64GB version costs £619 while the SIM-free 128GB is a whopping
£699.

That increases if you decide to go for the larger iPhone 6s Plus, which starts
with a SIM-free price of £619 for the 16GB version.

The SIM-free 64GB model is £699 and the top-tier SIM-free 128GB iPhone 6s Plus
costs £789.

Apple's new smartphone will be released on September 25 and are currently
available for pre-order.
