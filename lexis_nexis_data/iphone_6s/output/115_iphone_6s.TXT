6S Plus in India on October 16. This will be the fastest iPhone rollout ever for
the Indian market, coming less than a month after the latest models became
available globally.

The October 16 launch puts the new iPhones in position to cash in on the
upcoming festive season. The biggest competitors to the new iPhones in the
Indian market will be Samsung's Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+.

While there is no increment in screen size in iPhone 6S (4.7-inch HD) and iPhone
6S (5.5-inch Full HD) compared to last year's models, they feature a new 3D
Touch display technology, which allows them to differentiate between types of
touches and taps in preloaded apps as well as on the homescreen.

Both iPhones are powered by the new A9 processor with 2GB RAM and run on iOS 9
operating system. They come in 3 storage variants: 16, 64, and 128GB; there is
no support for microSD cards for storage expansions. The rear cameras of the two
smartphones have 12MP resolution, backed by dual-tone dual-LED flash, while the
front cameras have 5MP sensors. Along with the standard silver, space gray and
gold colours, iPhone 6S and 6S Plus also come in a new rose gold hue.

While there is no official word on the pricing, it is expected that iPhone 6S
will be available at starting price of around Rs 60,000, while iPhone 6S Plus
will cost approximately Rs 68,000 for the base variant.
