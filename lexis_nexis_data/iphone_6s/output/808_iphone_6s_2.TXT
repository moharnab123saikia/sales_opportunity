buttons or swipes and gestures to control the action. But when you get a screen
that is capable of sensing varying levels of pressure (like the iPhone 6s and 6s
Plus), it opens up some new avenues for developers. This is the first free game
that

takes advantage of 3D Touch on the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus to enable a new control
scheme. It was showcased during the iPhone 6s reveal and developers Pixel Toys
have employed the free-to-play model. Certain items and features within the game
will need to be purchased with real money at a later stage.This is not to say
that the game won't work on older iPhones -it does, but without the pressure
sensing control scheme.

In Freeblade, you take control of a mech -think of it like a heavily-weaponised
suit -to destroy everything in your path. You swipe across the screen to aim and
fire and with 3D Touch, you press harder to fire secondary weapons. At times, it
does seem like everything is on rails (you don't have control over movement
-just aiming and firing) and the camera forces you to look in certain directions
-but the sound effects and 3D rendering make up for this.
