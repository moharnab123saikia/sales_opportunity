While pundits and analysts often like to claim that interest in the iPhone has
already peaked, Apple's sales figures continue to prove otherwise. Apple earlier
today released weekend sales figures for its brand new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus
models and, suffice it to say, they're exceedingly popular.

"Sales for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any
previous first weekend sales results in Apple's history," Apple CEO Tim Cook
said in a press release. "Customers' feedback is incredible and they are loving
3D Touch and Live Photos, and we can't wait to bring iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s
Plus to customers in even more countries on October 9."

As for specific figures, Apple over the weekend sold over 13 million units of
its new devices, setting a brand new launch weekend record in the process. The
previous iPhone weekend sales record occurred last year when Apple sold 10
million iPhone 6 devices. That being the case, opening weekend sales skyrocketed
by an impressive 30%. Undoubtedly helping matters is that the iPhone 6s was
available in China at launch. In contrast, the iPhone 6 was not.

As mentioned by Tim Cook, the iPhone 6s in just a few weeks will go on sale in a
number of new countries, includingÂ Italy, Spain, Taiwan, Mexico, and Russia.
