the mantra about looking beyond face value comes to mind. But start using the
phone and you can see some differences.

Apple has thrown out the label Force Touch and now calls it 3D Touch. The clever
combination of software and hardware means the device can sense the amount of
force you use in a touch and offer a variety of options in response. 3D Touch
and the "quick look" feature Apple is calling "peek-and-pop" could come with a
similar explainer.

Press a bit and you "peek" at a pop-up of information. Press a little harder and
you "pop" through to the next level of information or to a particular feature
within an app.

The 6s/6s Plus rear camera is now a 12 megapixel camera.The front camera goes
from 1.5 megapixels to 5 megapixels and now has a flash. It is the first iPhone
that can shoot and edit 4K video. It is also made out of a tougher grade of
aluminium and has a tougher glass screen.

It will run iOS 9, the new operating system available as a free update for
download on older Apple devices on September 16. And it will be faster - there
will be a faster chip and faster wi-fi. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus is available
for preorder from tomorrow and will be available on September 25. Prices: iPhone
6S: $1079 for 16Gb model; $1229 for 64Gb, and $1370 for 127Gb. iPhone 6s Plus:
$1229 for 16GB model, $1379 for the 64GB model and $1529 for 128Gb.
