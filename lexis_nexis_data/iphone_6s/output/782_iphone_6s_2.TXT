

A VIDEO test pushing the iPhone 6S beyond its natural limits appears to show
Apple has given its latest smartphone a secret super power.

While Apple has never claimed the iPhone 6S is waterproof, a new video shows it
could be designed to survive an accidental drenching or even dunking in the loo,
the cause of death for countless phones.

YouTuber Zach Straley shows the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus submerged for
an hour and in working order when pulled out of the water and dried off.Before
you test it yourself, a word of warning: Apple's warranty won't cover you.
