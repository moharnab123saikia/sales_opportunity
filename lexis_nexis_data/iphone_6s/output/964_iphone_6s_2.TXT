iPhones that are smarter, faster and tougher than ever.

Apple chief Tim Cook unveiled the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, the 12-inch iPad Pro
and a revamped Apple TV that, with its own app store, is Apple's bid to grab
part of the $US34 billion ($48 billion) games console market.

The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus look the same as last year's models, with a 4.7-inch
(12cm) screen for the 6S and a 5.5-inch (14cm) screen for the bigger phablet.
But under the hood there are improvements, as well as a tougher aluminium body
and glass.

The new phones have "3D Touch", which lets you quickly access features of the
phone by applying extra force as you touch the touchscreen, plus a 12-megapixel
camera.

Selfie fans will appreciate an upgrade to the front-facing camera, to five
megapixels, plus the ability to use the glow of the touchscreen as a flash.

Apple also made a push into productivity with an iPad Pro, a 12-inch (30cm)
tablet that lets you view apps side-by-side in split-screen.

While Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was said to be dismissive of the need for any
stylus besides a finger, Apple launched the "Pencil" along with a fold-up
keyboard.

Potentially the biggest announcement was the launch of a new Apple TV, with an
app store that will allow third-party app makers to transfer popular games,
news, entertainment and lifestyle apps from mobile devices to television
screens.Rod Chester travelled to San Francisco as a guest of Apple
