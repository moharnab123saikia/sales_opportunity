

The new iPhones are hitting store shelves Friday morning.

Consumers can buy the latest models of Apple s smartphone, the iPhone 6s and the
jumbo-sized iPhone 6s Plus, at the company s retail stores. They can also find
them at the stores of the major wireless carriers and some other major
electronics retailers.

The key feature of the new models, which share the same size and shape as last
year s versions, is something Apple calls 3D Touch. The feature can recognize
how hard users are pressing on the devices  screens and display different kinds
of information for different presses.

The new phones also feature more powerful cameras and a faster processor than
last year s models. The rear camera in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus has a
12-megapixel resolution, up from 8 megapixels previously.

The iPhone 6s starts at $650 without a contract. The iPhone 6s Plus starts at
$750 without a contract.

Last year s models were the first-ever large screen iPhones and sold in record
numbers. Financial analysts who follow the company generally expect the growth
in the Apple s iPhones sales to fall from its recent torrid pace.
