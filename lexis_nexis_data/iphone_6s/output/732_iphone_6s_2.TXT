one as early as now can tune into this weird two-minute YouTube video
instructing users how to turn their iPhone 6s into an iPhone 7.

In the viral video uploaded by Peripatetic Pandas on Tuesday, it demonstrates 10
'carefree' steps on how to engineer an iPhone 7 without knocking on Apple's
headquarters. First, the man in the video eliminated the headphone jack of the
iPhone 6s and then drilled two holes for dual speakers. The next outrageous step
he did was to get a spare iPhone 6 and snipped its camera and glued it onto the
other iPhone 6s prototype.

Then he firmly placed masking tape onto the phone's body and swooshed deep-blue
spray paint. It is whispered among tech news sites that the next flagship
product of Apple would wear its deep bluish coat.

After the spray painting procedure, he removed the masking tape and voila, the
'brand new' iPhone 7. To social media's 'bewilderment,' plenty of YouTube users
glorified Peripatetic Pandas for his creativity.

The hilarious do-it-yourself clip hast gotten 124,000 views as of this writing.
