

KIWIS are paying 20 per cent more for the latest iPhones compared to last year's
version.

The 16GB iPhone 6S costs $1199, compared to the iPhone 6 which cost $999 when it
was released a year ago.

Last year, the 16GB iPhone 6 Plus cost $1199, compared to the 6S Plus which
costs $1399.

The increase is being blamed on the falling NZ dollar.

This time last year the kiwi bought US81 cents. Today, it buys US63c.

That's a 22 per cent fall.

Kiwis can expect price rises for all electronic equipment in the next few
months.

That doesn't seem to be putting people off the new iPhones, with Spark selling
out of some models and the Apple store showing long waits for the 6S Plus.

Anyone ordering the iPhone 6 Plus from Apple will have to wait three to four
weeks for delivery. This is the same for all colours and storage options.

The only 6S model showing a delay is the 64GB model in pink (rose gold), for
which people will have to wait for two to three weeks.

Spark has sold out of the 6S Plus 16GB model and also indicates stock is limited
for other models. It says pre-orders are limited to one per customer.

Apple's new iPhones became available for pre-order in New Zealand over the
weekend ahead of their release on Friday, September 25.

Pre-orders for its latest iPhone have been so strong that Apple expects to
surpass last year's record, when it sold 10 million phones during the first
weekend.

"As many customers noticed, the online demand for iPhone 6s Plus has been
exceptionally strong and exceeded our own forecasts for the pre-order period,"
an Apple spokesman said.

For people buying the devices outright, the iPhone 6s, which has a 4.7-inch
display, costs $1199 for the 16GB model, $1399 for the 64GB model and $1599 for
the 128GB model. The larger iPhone 6s Plus, with a 5.5-inch display, costs $1399
for the 16GB model, $1599 for the 64GB model and $1799 for the 128GB model.

Kiwis often think they pay more than other countries for gadgets, but a look at
prices for the new iPhones around the world show we aren't doing too badly.
