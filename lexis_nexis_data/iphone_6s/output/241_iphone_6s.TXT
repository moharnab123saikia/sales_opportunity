

IT'S iPhone time again! Apple has just launched two new smartphones.

And StarTech has been lucky enough to take them for a spin.

The iPhone 6s and bigger 6s Plus may look familiar on the outside, but there's
plenty going on inside to get fans excited.

Perhaps the biggest change is the new 3D Touch display.

This clever screen is packed with sensors that know exactly how much pressure
you're applying.

The iPhone can then enable gestures so you can dip in and out of content without
losing your place.

For example, you can tap and hold the phone app to reveal your most popular
contacts and call them without lifting your finger off the screen.

3D Touch. also provides shortcuts to the 3D Touch also provides shortcuts to the
things you do most, so you can send a message or take a selfie with just a
simple press from the Home screen. Having tested 3D Touch, it's a dream to use
and we can see it becoming a very welcome addition.

Another new feature on the 6s is the improved camera, which can record in Ultra
HD 4K quality.

We viewed content shot in this format and it looks mightily impressive. Another
bonus is the new Live Photo mode.

This records a short video each time you take picture, allowing your snaps to
move and come to life. It's a nice way to view your images, but the jury's out
on how often use it. With Apple's super-fast A9 chip inside, the iPhone 6s feels
slick.

Apps are swift to launch and you get the feeling the new iPhone will cope with
everything thrown at it.

One thing we did notice is this new device is slightly bigger than its older
sibling. And the new means the iPhone tech has put on a small amount of weight.
But one bonus of this added bulk is that the iPhone 6s is tough.

Apple say the screen is made from the strongest glass on any smartphone. And
we're sure people will accidentally test the truth of this when it goes on sale
next week.

We had only a short time with the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but there's plenty to
be excited about.

They look good, are fast and you'll be wondering how you ever managed without 3D
Touch.

Apple's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus can be pre-ordered now.
