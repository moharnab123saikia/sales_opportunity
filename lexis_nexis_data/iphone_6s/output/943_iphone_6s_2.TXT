* Apple releases YouTube video ad featuring Cookie Monster

* Cookie Monster bakes cookies with Siri in iPhone ad

Does anyone love cookies more than Cookie Monster? Probably not.

The famous blue Muppet demonstrates just that in a new iPhone 6s ad released on
YouTube Wednesday.

The ad, promoting the phone's hands-free Siri technology, features Cookie
Monster baking cookies, of course, with the help of Siri.

The video is an exercise in patience for the Muppet as he tries, hilariously, to
pass the time until his cookies are ready. Luckily, while Siri may keep Cookie
Monster company, he at least doesn't have to worry about sharing any of the
gooey baked goods when they're done.
