purchase a new iPhone 6s at the Apple store in Palo Alto on Friday. And she/it
got one.

"I'm in line like everybody else, I just have a different body," Lempesis told
ABC-7 News . "I am number 15 in line. Some people have left chairs here and
they're not really here, so I feel like I'm being really fair by being here and
I'm committed to being here the entire time."

Lempesis and her robot were among thousands of people (we're pretty sure the
rest were people) around the world to line up to be among the first to buy
Apple's latest smartphones , the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, which went on
sale Friday.
