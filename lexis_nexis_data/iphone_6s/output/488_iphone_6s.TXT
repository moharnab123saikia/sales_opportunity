hardware

While seeing an iPhone 6c is not going to be happen during any remaining month
of 2015, all that might change next year. In addition to releasing its iPhone 6s
and iPhone 6s Plus, Apple is also intending on releasing a lesser performing
iPhone 6c. Now, we have received information that the upcoming smartphone is
going to have a much bigger performance margin as compared to iPhone 5c, because
iPhone 6c is going to feature FinFET chips.

Sources close to the information claim that iPhone 6c is either going to be
incorporated with TMSC's 16nm FinFET chips, or Samsung's 14nm FinFET ones. There
were reports coming in that iPhone 6c would feature Apple's chipset that would
be based on TSMC's 20nm process, but that would not allow the handset to possess
impressive processing power and energy efficiency like FinFET chips are able to
deliver. Apple's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are expected to be released during
the month of September, and will feature impressive specifications, including a
20nm Cat 6 LTE modem from Qualcomm.

Apple will be looking to exclude home buttons from its next lineup of iPhones
(after iPhone 6s), so we will be looking forward to that kind of innovation. As
for the specifications that we do know about iPhone 6c, the handset is expected
to feature a 4 inch display with a much higher resolution as compared to iPhone
5c. Moreoever, Apple might exclude 16 GB iPhones from its production, so it
looks like we will be looking at a 32 GB iPhone 6c in the future.

Having FinFET chips installed in smartphones has many benefits, with the two
primary ones being improved efficiency and very impressive performance. Unlike
iPhone 5c, we expect iPhone 6c to feature a slightly larger price tag thanks to
its improved hardware.
