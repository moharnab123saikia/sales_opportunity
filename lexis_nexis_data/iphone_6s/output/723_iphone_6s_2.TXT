

HUNDREDS of Apple fans have queued overnight to get their hands on the latest
iPhone.

Tech lovers queued around the block outside Apple's Buchanan Street store in
Glasgow ahead of the launch yesterday, with some waiting in line for 23 hours.

Apple claims demand for its new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus could surpass the
record-breaking sales of iPhone 6 last year.

Marius Ostachi, 17, a student at Shawlands Academy who waited for 23 hours in
the queue to get his hands on the new gadget, said: "I want to see what new apps
and technology it brings. I feel like I'm famous just for getting a new phone."

Matthew Casey, 21, a software engineer from Glasgow, waited since 6.30am for his
reserved phone.

He said: "I feel bad because some people have been waiting for hours and I've
just swooped in at the last minute.

"I've always known about the cult of Apple but I'd never been a part of it
before. Now it seems that I'm the leader of the cult in Scotland."

The new iPhone 6s, which was unveiled earlier this month, comes with an improved
camera in both the front and rear, as well as a pressure sensitive screen -
where users can press more firmly in order to open new shortcuts - a feature
Apple calls 3D Touch.

The firm said pre-orders were "on pace" to match those of the iPhone 6 launch in
last year, when that device went on to sell more than 10million units in three
days.

Phil Schiller, Apple's head of worldwide marketing said: "Customer response to
the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been incredibly positive."
