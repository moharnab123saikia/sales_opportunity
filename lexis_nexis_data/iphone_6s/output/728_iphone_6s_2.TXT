Plus are on track to beat last year&#8217;s sales of 10 million new iPhones in
the first weekend last year.


Apple said Monday that global pre-orders for its latest iPhones were on track to
beat last year's sales of 10 million devices in the first weekend, which was a
record for the company.

"Online demand has exceeded our own forecasts for the pre-order period," Trudy
Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said. Ms. Miller said the company was working to
catch up as with demand and that the phones would be available in Apple retail
stores next Friday.

Investor expectations are high for the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, which
were introduced at a huge product release event last week in San Francisco.

After Apple introduced the first iteration of its larger-screen iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6 Plus, the company posted an $18 billion profit, the most profitable
quarter ever for a publicly traded company, in its fourth quarter of fiscal
2014.

IPhone pre-orders began over the weekend and the phones go on sale Sept. 25.
