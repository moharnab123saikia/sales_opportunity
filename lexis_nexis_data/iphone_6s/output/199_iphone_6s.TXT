

Apple is today launching a tough new iPhone 6 with an aluminium casing to
prevent a repetition of "Bendgate".

Some iPhone 6 Plus mobiles warped when put in back pockets, but the iPhone 6s
and 6s Plus are designed to stay in shape.

Prices are expected to start from £539 for the 6S and £619 for the 6s Plus.

Apple is also set to unveil a king-size, 12.9in iPad and a 12.2ins iPad Air Plus
to take on Microsoft's 12ins Surface Pro 3.

A cheaper gold Apple Watch is also on the cards.

Is this a tantalising glimpse of the iPhone 6s?
