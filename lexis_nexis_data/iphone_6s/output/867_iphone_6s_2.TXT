

Men hoping to get their hands on an iPhone 6s have been given a chance to do so
- by donating at a SPERM BANK .

The marketing technique has caught the eyes of students in the country, who may
be thinking seriously about checking in for the intimate deal.

The sperm banks, in China, sent out WeChat messages to followers that offered
potential donors just short of the cash equivalent of the latest Apple gadget.

The users of the social network received a message called ' New ways to get an
iPhone 6s ' with an image of the much sought-after phone.

It read: "The bank is seeking donors aged 22 to 45, each to receive £503, while
the iPhone 6s is priced at £535 on the mainland."

Hubei Human Sperm Bank in central China sent out their message on Monday,
followed by Shanghai Human Sperm Bank at Renji Hospital, the latter of which has
been read more than 400,000 times.

According to China Daily , a student named Li said that his roommate was
tempted, while another, called Wang, felt like it wasn't a bad idea, just a new
tactic.

A Dr Zhu from Hubei's sperm bank, said they'd been struggling to get new donors
and the marketing is a new trick, but he says they're targeting adults who can
make their own decisions.

China's rules on sperm banks mean there's only one in each province, and all 18
are struggling to attract new donors.
