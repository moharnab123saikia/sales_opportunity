

Great news - you've just picked up your brand new Apple iPhone 6s, with the
snazzy new 3D touch feature, and that selfie flash you've always wanted.

Next thing you know, up pops a video claiming that Apple might have 'secretly'
made the phones watertight, meaning you can drop it in a bowl of water for up to
an hour without significant damage.

But don't reach for the sink just yet. It's best you don'ttry this one yourself,
unless you want a soggy and dead - if otherwise pristine - iPhone.

Apple don't advertise the phones as being waterproof, so those hoping to claim
back some money from a water-damaged iPhone won't have much luck.

Testing the supposed ability, Zach Straley posted a video on YouTube which sees
him put a brand new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus into a small bowl of water, as
the stopwatch app counts up to an hour. When he takes the phones out, they
appear to work perfectly well - 3D Touch and all.

However, a video from iDeviceHelp saw an iPhone 6s Plus plunged into four foot
deep pool of water, with far less successful results - the phone barely lasted
two minutes, and wouldn't even turn on afterwards.

While some have suggested that the iPhone 6s might survive in shallow pools
thanks to water-resistant tech, others have speculated as to whether the video
might just be a pesky hoax to lure the unwitting into breaking their new
devices.

Long story short: don't chuck your brand new iPhone into a tub of water, ok?
