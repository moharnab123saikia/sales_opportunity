HIGHLIGHT:Â 49% of its users still use iOS 7





Within a week of release, about 46% of Apple users have installed the latest iOS

8 in their devices via App Store.



The iPhone maker noted in its App Store Distribution page that 49% of its users

still use iOS 7, and 5% use its previous iteration of mobile OS, exceeding

earlier estimates.



One factor that may have delayed the adoption could be due to Apple's

specifications to have a large amount of free space on users' device for

installing the iOS 8 version.



The new OS version comes with improved interface and security, in addition to

some major modifications compared to iOS 7, which include a visual revamp

together with functional tweaks such as the capability to deal with messages and

accept calls.



In addition, Apple also reported that sales of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have

surpassed 10 million within three days of its launch.



Apple CEO Tim Cook said: "Sales for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded our

expectations for the launch weekend, and we couldn't be happier."



With the new 5.5 inch iPhone 6 Plus, and 4.7 inch iPhone 6, Apple made its entry

into the big display market and increased the display size while trimming down

overall size to develop a slim phone.
