Both Meteor and 3 Ireland today said they are taking pre-orders for the highly

The latest must-have gadget will be available to pre-order on Meteor from today

for delivery next Friday.



It prices the iPhone 6 (16GB) from E99 on Meteor's Smart Classic price plan,

which includes 6GB of 4G data along with Unlimited Calls and Texts. The iPhone 6

Plus will be available from E199 on the same price plan, it said.



Three said pre-registration numbers for the new phone have been significant and

are expected to sell out quickly. It said that the iPhone 6 will be available

from E179 and the iPhone 6 Plus will be available from E279 on our E55 a month

price plan. Commenting on the pre-sale launch, Elaine Carey, Chief Commercial

Officer at Three, said: "We are delighted to be able to launch the newest iPhone

6 and iPhone 6 Plus so soon after the handset announcement from Apple. There has

been a great level of interest in the new iPhones from customers, and we expect

to sell out promptly. Our 'All You Can Eat' data offer is still the best value

proposition in the market. Combined with either of the exciting new iPhone

handsets, Three continues to offer the best value for customers." For more,
