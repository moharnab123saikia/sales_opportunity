Apple customers will receive their iPhone 6 handsets on its release date,

despite rumours of shipping delays, according to the supplier.



There has been unprecedented anticipation and record pre-sales for the iPhone 6

and the iPhone 6 Plus, which led to rumours of a shortage of the product for

those hungry to experience the handsets at the first opportunity.



But according to a source at leading supplier Verizon, both the smartphones have

started their shipping transit and a due to arrive with early-bird phone punters

on September 19, the day the new models are set to hit retail shops.



Sources also say that at least 80% of pre-orders are expected to be delivered on

the launch day.



Fans of the Apple products are expected to besiege retailers on Friday to pick

up the phones, with large queues sure to form the before opening.



Apple revealed the much anticipated iPhone 6 and iWatch at a packed press event

this week, ending months of waiting for gadget fans.



The iPhone comes in two sizes and has a larger screen than previous incarnations

.



It'll also do contactless payments, has an upgraded camera and vastly improved

battery life.



As with the iPhone 5s, the 6 and 6 Plus will both be available in Silver, Space

Grey, and gold. All three colours will be available at launch.



The storage options have been upgraded for the 6 and 6 Plus. The base storage

remains at 16GB, but above that it jumps to 64GB. A new 128GB option has been

introduced, and the 32GB option has been removed.



The iPhone 5S is still available in 16GB and 32GB, and the 5C is still available

with 8GB.



Will you be getting the iPhone 6 within a week of it going on sale in the shops?
