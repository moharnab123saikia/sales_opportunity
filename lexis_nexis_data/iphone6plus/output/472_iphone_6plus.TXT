more than OMR500 and up to OMR900, traders who have got the price list said.


"The price list we have got from dealers in Dubai shows that the iPhone 6 16GB
version will cost OMR540 and iPhone 6 plus 16GB version will cost OMR680," a
sales representative at Smart Zone, said.
Apple last week unveiled the two latest models in its iPhone series, both of
which boast a larger screen, in a bid to recapture its role as a technological
trend-setter and many in Oman are waiting to own the new handsets.
According to the trader, iPhone 6 16GB will cost OMR540, 64GB OMR590 and 128GB
will cost OMR640.
Meanwhile, iPhone 6 plus 16GB will cost OMR680, 64GB OMR790 and 128GB will cost
OMR890.

" These are the initial prices sent by the dealers in Dubai. Now, we have to get
Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRA) permission for sales. Most probably, the new
iPhones will be available by the last week of this month," the sales
representative added.
Apple's online store crashed under the weight of demand from fans hoping to
pre-order one of the new iPhone 6 models launched this week.
The company announced it would take pre-orders, but within minutes it had begun
displaying "We'll be back" messages in several languages. Twitter users reported
problems with sites around the world before the service appeared to be restored
after 30 minutes.
It is the second time this week Apple's site has crashed under strong demand.
Meanwhile, people who were lucky enough to have secured pre-orders for the first
iPhone 6 shipments are now selling them on eBay at more than $1000 than they
paid for them.
According to Apple's official US website, the price of iPhone 6 16GB is at
US$199 for US customers while the iPhone 6 Plus 16GB will be at US$299 with a
two-year contract. Muscat Press and Publishing House SAOC 2014
