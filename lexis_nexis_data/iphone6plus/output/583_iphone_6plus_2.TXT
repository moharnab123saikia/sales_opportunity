Sept. 20--A crowd of about 40 people stood in line for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

Plus smartphones outside the AT&T store on Navarro Street on Friday morning.



Some people waited in line overnight to get the newest model released by Apple.



About 2 p.m. Friday, the store still had the iPhone 6 in stock but had run out

of the iPhone 6 Plus. Store employees said they expect it won't be in stock

again until mid-November.



The iPhone 6 has a 4.5-inch touch-screen and the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch

screen. The previous model, the iPhone 5s had a 4-inch screen.



A team of employees waited inside, anticipating the rush when doors opened at 8

a.m. -- something they plan for every year.



"This had been a really successful launch," said assistant sales manager Luz

Lobo.



She took names for the waiting list to meet with a sales associate at one of the

store's two entrances which at the time, was a 35-minute wait.



Before the doors opened, an employee told customers waiting outside they were

welcome to wait but the shipment would arrive at 10:30 a.m. and they didn't know

how many iPhones it contained.



Lobo said she could not disclose how many phones they received.



According to an Apple press release, the company began taking preorders for the

new iPhones on Sept. 12, when a record 4 million orders were made within the

first 24 hours.
