It's raining flagship Smartphones in October in India!

Apple has set the launch time for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus around the
festive time in India, but don't we also see Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Note
Edge, Sony Xperia Z3, and Android One Smartphones to come out in India around
the same time!

It is around this time of the year that most of the companies bring their
high-end smartphones to the market in India, considering that it helps boosting
their sales. With this announcement being made by Apple, we expect Samsung to
launch its Galaxy Note 4 and Note Edge in India around the same time. Samsung
and Apple are Arch rivals, and Samsung will ensure that the company does give
Apple a tough competition in India by launching its phones prior to the Apple's
Iphone 6 Launch in India.

Moreover, Nokia is already planning to launch its affordable flagship Lumia 830
in October. It is around the same time that we might as well see Sony's flagship
Xperia Z3 launch in India.

Moreover, on the affordable side, Google will most likely announce the Android
One smartphones in India on the 15 of this month, however will bring it to the
market in the first half of October. With all of these products set for October
launch, the competition is going to go even more intense.
