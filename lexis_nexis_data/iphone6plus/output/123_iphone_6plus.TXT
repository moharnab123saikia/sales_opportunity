The Apple fanboys who are waiting to get hold of the Iphone 6 and Iphone 6 Plus

in India will be delighted to know that the phones will be available in India

from October 18.



The Cupertino announced the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus with 4.7-inch display and

5.5-inch display respectively, which will go up on pre-order on September 12 and

on sale in the US on September 19. However, the company's India website shows

that the new iPhones will come to India on October 17, almost a month after its

launch in the US. The website was first showing the launch date to be September

It's raining flagship Smartphones in October in India!



Apple has set the launch time for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus around the

festive time in India, but don't we also see Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Note

Edge, Sony Xperia Z3, and Android One Smartphones to come out in India around

the same time!



It is around this time of the year that most of the companies bring their

high-end smartphones to the market in India, considering that it helps boosting

their sales. With this announcement being made by Apple, we expect Samsung to

launch its Galaxy Note 4 and Note Edge in India around the same time. Samsung

and Apple are Arch rivals, and Samsung will ensure that the company does give

Apple a tough competition in India by launching its phones prior to the Apple's

Iphone 6 Launch in India.



Moreover, Nokia is already planning to launch its affordable flagship Lumia 830

in October. It is around the same time that we might as well see Sony's flagship

Xperia Z3 launch in India.



Moreover, on the affordable side, Google will most likely announce the Android

One smartphones in India on the 15 of this month, however will bring it to the

market in the first half of October. With all of these products set for October

launch, the competition is going to go even more intense.



An expensive affair!



The company has not revealed any information on its pricing as yet. As far as

the price is concerned, Apple has priced the carrier-subsidized iPhone 6 16GB

variant for the $199, going up to $399 for the 128GB variant. The price of the

5.5-inch variant starts at $299 for the 16GB and goes up to $499 for the 128GB

variant. The prices for the unlocked version f the phones will start from $649

for the iPhone 6 and $749 for the iPhone 6 Plus.

comes with a 4.7-inch (1334750 pixels) display. As expected, both the phones are
