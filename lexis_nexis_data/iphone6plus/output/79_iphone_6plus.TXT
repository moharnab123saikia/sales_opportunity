The long-awaited, muchhyped iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones will be going

on sale in Saskatchewan beginning Friday. The iPhone 6, which was launched with

much fanfare last Tuesday in Cupertino, Calif., will be available at SaskTel

retail store locations and select SaskTel Authorized Apple iPhone dealers, the

Crown telecommunications company announced Monday.



Telus, Bell and Rogers customers in Saskatchewan will also be able to buy the

new iPhone 6 on Friday, according to spokespersons for the three wireless

companies.



"We always experience high demand for Apple devices and we are confident SaskTel

customers will enjoy using the remarkable new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on

SaskTel's leading network," Ron Styles, Sask-Tel president and CEO, said in a

media release.



SaskTel will allowiPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus customers to connect to its 4G

(fourth generation) LTE (long-term evolution) network.



Prices for the iPhone 6 will be starting at $265 for the 16 gigabyte (GB) model

and iPhone 6 Plus will be available starting at $375 for the 16GB model based on

a 24-month contract.



The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are said to be "the biggest advancements in

iPhone history," featuring two new models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch Retina HD

displays, and packed with innovative technologies, such as iSight and FaceTime

HD cameras and iOS 8, Apple's latest mobile operating system, which has a health

application that allows users to monitor their health and fitness levels

instantly.



A spokeswoman for SaskTel said Apple is allowing SaskTel to offer the iPhone 6

at the same time as competitors like Rogers and Telus.



"It's exciting for us to be able to offer it to our customers at the same time

as the other competitors in the market," said Michelle Englot, director of

external communications at SaskTel.



"Apple is very particular about who provides their phones and (other) devices,

so we're happy that we've proven ourselves and get the same consideration as

anyone else."



While the Big Three competitors (Telus, Bell and Rogers) will be offering the

iPhone 6 on Friday, Englot added that none of them has the same "footprint" in

terms of coverage in Saskatchewan that SaskTel has.
