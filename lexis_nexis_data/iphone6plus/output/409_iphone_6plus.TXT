upcoming iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. According to a report in Wall Street
Journal (WSJ), quoting person familiar with Apple's plans, "Instead of 16GB as a
starting point for the entry-level iPhone, the new starting point will be
32GB...." This means Apple would reportedly be bringing 32GB storage option back
to its iPhone lineup after a gap of three years. Apple iPhone 5S, which was
launched in 2013, came with a 32GB variant.

However, all iPhones launched after that -- iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s,
iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE -- come in 16GB and 64GB variants. Apple added a
128GB variant with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models.While the larger 5.5-inch
iPhone 7 is expected to come in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage variants, the
smaller version is said to come in 32GB, 64GB and 256GB storage variants.As
widely speculated by several other publications too, the report adds that the
larger version of the rumoured iPhone 7 will sport a 5.5-inch display and a
dual-camera sensor.The dual camera set-up is expected to help users capture
images in different depth of fields so that theu can later choose what they want
to focus in the image in the post editing phase.In addition, the smaller iPhone
7 version is likely to come with a 4.7-inch display. Also, though the smaller
version is unlikely to get the dual-camera setup, it is expected to still be
receiving an upgrade on camera front. The report also claims that the upcoming
models won't sport a headphone jack.
