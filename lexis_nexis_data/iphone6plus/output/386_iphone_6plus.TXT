Apple trounced Wall Street forecasts late Monday due to red-hot sales of its

iPhone 6 smartphones and Mac computers. The tech titan also guided sales

estimates higher for the holiday quarter.



For its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, Apple earned $1.42 a share, up 20%

from a year earlier and topping analysts' consensus forecast by 11 cents.



Sales rose 12% to $42.1 billion, easily beating the target of $39.88 billion. It

was Apple's strongest revenue growth in seven quarters.



Shares of Apple rose nearly 2% in late trading. The stock ended the regular

session up 2% to 99.76.



Apple sold 39.3 million iPhones in Q4, up 12% vs. a year earlier, and clearing

analysts' goal of 37.5 million. The quarter included just nine days of sales of

the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, with some models supply-constrained.



The iPhone business generated sales of $23.7 billion, or 56% of Apple's total

revenue in its Q4.



"Demand for the new iPhones has been staggering," CEO Tim Cook said on a

conference call with analysts. Apple ended Q4 with a "significant backlog" of

orders for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, he said. Demand for the iPhone 6 is

"markedly higher" than for the iPhone 5 S and 5 C last fall.



The iPhone 6 series phones are now available in 32 countries and should reach 69

countries by the end of October and 115 by the end of calendar 2014, Cook said.



Apple's iPad business disappointed, with 12.3 million units sold vs. forecasts

for 13 million. That was a 13% drop vs. Q4 2013, the third straight

year-over-year decline. Apple unveiled new iPad models this month.



The Real Big Mac



But Macs had a stronger-than-expected back-to-school season. Apple sold 5.5

million Macs, up 21% from a year ago and beating Wall Street's target of 4.8

million.



Mac sales generated nearly 17% of total Q4 revenue, topping the declining iPads,

which fell to 13% of revenue. Mac sales reached their highest quarterly market

share since 1995, Cook said.



Apple's gross profit margin was 38% vs. 37% a year earlier. For the December

fiscal Q1, Apple sees a 37.5% to 38.5% margin.



Apple is targeting sales of $65 billion at the midpoint of its guidance,

compared with analyst expectations for $63.52 billion.



It did not specify an earnings-per-share target, but Wall Street has been

modeling for EPS of $2.40, up 16% year-on-year.



Apple is at the beginning of a "super cycle," Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian

White said, citing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Apple Pay and the upcoming

Apple Watch smartwatch.



On Monday, Apple launched its Apple Pay digital wallet service for iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus owners to make retail purchases with a touch of their phone.



Piper Jaffray tested Apple Pay at three participating retailers -- McDonald's,

Walgreen and Whole Foods Market.



"We were able to complete transactions without issue," Piper Jaffray analyst

Gene Munster said in a report. "The one hurdle was funding of Apple Pay was

limited to eight eligible banks, which could limit the experience for customers

of non-participating banks. Apple will update the list of banks as added.

Overall, the experience was as simple as advertised."
