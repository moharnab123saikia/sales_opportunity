so next week.

The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which went on sale on September 25th in 12 countries
including the US, UK, China and Australia, will be launched in 40 more markets
on October 9th. Ireland, Mexico, Russia and Spain are among the second tranche
to get the phone, with Apple intending to make the handsets available in more
than 130 countries by the end of the year.

The phone will cost from EUR 759 for the iPhone 6S and EUR 869 for the iPhone 6S
Plus, with 216GB, 64GB and 128GB models available. The Apple Watch arrived in
Ireland last week, several months after its April launch.

Apple said it had sold more than 13 million iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus
handsets within three days of its launch, with chief executive Tim Cook
describing the sales as "phenomenal". They beat all first weekend sales results
in Apple's history.

When the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus debuted last year, the company sold 10 million
iPhones in the first weekend. The new phones' sales figures were given a boost
by China, which wasn't part of the initial release in 2014.
