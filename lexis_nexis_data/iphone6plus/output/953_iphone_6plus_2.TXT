VIETNAMESE student Cuong Nguyin is so keen to get his hands on his first

smartphone that he turned up at 9am yesterday at a Somerset mall to queue for

the new iPhone 6 Plus, 24 hours before it goes on sale.



The Kaplan Singapore student, who has a Nokia phone, started a queue of tech

fans at 313@somerset, all eager to buy Apple's latest offerings, the 4.7-inch

iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.



The 22-year-old was eyeing the gold-coloured 64GB iPhone 6 Plus retailing at

$1,288. He said: "I don't have so much money. I had to save for a year."



By 5pm, there were more than 100 people behind him, including two Apple fans who

had flown in from Thailand. The new iPhones do not go on sale there until

November.



The earliest person spotted in a queue for the new gadget was at Bedok Mall at

5am yesterday, wearing a surgical face mask. Some customers admitted they were

were planning to sell their purchases.



Taiwanese student Jeremy Huang, 20, said he is buying the phone for a friend but

will sell it "if the price is good".



Singapore is one of nine markets where the new models are first released.
