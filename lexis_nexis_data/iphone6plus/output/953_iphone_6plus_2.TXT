smartphone that he turned up at 9am yesterday at a Somerset mall to queue for
the new iPhone 6 Plus, 24 hours before it goes on sale.

The Kaplan Singapore student, who has a Nokia phone, started a queue of tech
fans at 313@somerset, all eager to buy Apple's latest offerings, the 4.7-inch
iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.

The 22-year-old was eyeing the gold-coloured 64GB iPhone 6 Plus retailing at
$1,288. He said: "I don't have so much money. I had to save for a year."

By 5pm, there were more than 100 people behind him, including two Apple fans who
had flown in from Thailand. The new iPhones do not go on sale there until
November.

The earliest person spotted in a queue for the new gadget was at Bedok Mall at
5am yesterday, wearing a surgical face mask. Some customers admitted they were
were planning to sell their purchases.

Taiwanese student Jeremy Huang, 20, said he is buying the phone for a friend but
will sell it "if the price is good".

Singapore is one of nine markets where the new models are first released.
