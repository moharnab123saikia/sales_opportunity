

The long-awaited, muchhyped iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones will be going
on sale in Saskatchewan, beginning Friday.

The iPhone 6, which was launched with much fanfare last Tuesday in Cupertino,
Calif., will be available at SaskTel retail store locations and select SaskTel
Authorized Apple iPhone dealers, the Crown telecommunications company announced
Monday. Telus, Bell and Rogers customers in Saskatchewan will also be able to
buy the new iPhone 6 Friday, according to spokespersons for the three wireless
companies.

"We always experience high demand for Apple devices and we are confident SaskTel
customers will enjoy using the remarkable new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on
SaskTel's leading network," Ron Styles, Sask-Tel president and CEO, said in a
news release.

SaskTel will allow iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus customers to connect to its 4G
(fourth generation) LTE (long-term evolution) network.

Prices for the iPhone 6 will start at $265 for the 16 gigabyte (GB) model and
iPhone 6 Plus will be available starting at $375 for the 16GB model based on a
24-month contract.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are said to be "the biggest advancements in
iPhone history," featuring two new models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch Retina HD
displays, and packed with innovative technologies, such as iSight and FaceTime
HD cameras and iOS 8, Apple's latest mobile operating system, which has a health
application that allows users to monitor their health and fitness levels
instantly.

A spokeswoman for SaskTel said Apple is allowing SaskTel to offer the iPhone 6
at the same time as competitors, like Rogers and Telus.

"It's exciting for us to be able to offer it to our customers at the same time
as the other competitors in the market," said Michelle Englot, director of
external communications at SaskTel.

"Apple is very particular about who provides their phones and (other) devices,
so we're happy that we've proven us ourselves and get the same consideration as
anyone else."

While the 'big three' competitors (Telus, Bell and Rogers) will offer the iPhone
6 Friday, Englot added that none of them has the same "footprint" in terms of
coverage in Saskatchewan that SaskTel has.
