Apple hasn't yet officially started selling its newest iPhone 6s, 6s Plus in

India, but the flagship devices have already found their way on e-commerce giant

Flipkart. The iPhone 6s is available in Gold, Rose Gold, Silver, and Space Grey

colors. It has been listed at Rs 64,836 for the base model of 16 GB whereas the

64 GB and 128 GB variants have been listed at Rs 74,117 and Rs 83,401

respectively.



On the other hand, the phablet-sized iPhone 6s Plus has been listed at Rs 74,117

for the base model and Rs 83,401 and Rs 88,478 for the subsequent variants. A

listing by some other seller has quoted the 64 GB Rose Gold iPhone 6s Plus price

at Rs 85,945.



Apple has not made any announcement regarding the pricing details for India, but

the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are likely to cost around the same range as listed

on Flipkart.



Another possibility is that may be the Flipkart prices turn out to be the

official prices. But the surprising thing is that the site has allowed for a

purchase and the listing has been done not for pre-order. But, the phone will be

delivered after October 16, which is the official release date of the phones in

India.



The newest iPhones have come with a tap-reducing feature known as 3D Touch and

Apple has also added a new color Rose Gold in the choices.
