APPLE moved to recapture its role as the leading tech trend-setter as it

unveiled its first smartwatch and two large-screen versions of the iPhone.



The California company also said it was introducing a mobile wallet that will

allow consumers to simply tap their phones to pay retailers, aiming to

popularise the idea of mobile payments.



The Apple Watch, a sleekly designed wrist device that links to the iPhone, "will

redefine what people expect from this category", chief executive Tim Cook said.



Also unveiled were the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, in a large boost to the

screen size of the popular handsets.



Apple's main rival, Samsung, has long had a range of larger handsets and has

tried to market a smartwatch of its own.



The iPhone 6 will have a screen of 4.7 inches and the 6-Plus will be 5.5 inches,

allowing Apple to adapt to consumers' apparent preference for bigger displays.



The new iPhone 6 will start at the same price as existing iPhones at $US199

($215) for US customers while the iPhone 6 Plus will be at $US299 with a

two-year contract.



Apple said the devices would be available in at least 115 countries by the end

of the year.
