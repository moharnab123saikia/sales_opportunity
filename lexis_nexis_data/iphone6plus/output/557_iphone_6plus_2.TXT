Customers may have to wait three to four weeks to get their hands on Apple Inc`s

iPhone 6 Plus, after a record number of orders for the company`s latest

smartphones strained available supply. The new iPhone 6 goes on sale on Sept. 19

in the United States but the company began taking online orders on Thursday.

While the larger 5.5-inch "Plus" models now display a wait time of up to a

month, the 4.7-inch version remains available for delivery on Sept 19, Apple's

website showed. Verizon Wireless, AT&T and Sprint Corp, also showed shipment

delays of up to six weeks on their respective websites. Apple said the pace of

orders has so far outstripped any of its previous iPhones. "Response to iPhone 6

and iPhone 6 Plus has been incredible, with a record number of pre-orders

overnight. Pre-orders are currently available online or through the Apple Store

App," spokeswoman Trudy Muller said.Apple routinely grapples with iPhone supply

constraints, particularly in years that involve a smartphone re-design. The

latest iPhones come with larger screens and some analysts had anticipated that

production issues may keep a lid on initial runs.
