Washington: More than 10 million iPhones sold in first weekend

The Institution of Engineering and Technology has issued the following news

release:



Apple says it sold more than 10 million iPhones in the first weekend after its

new models went on sale on Friday.



Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company could have sold even more iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus models if it weren't for the supply constraints the company tends

to face in years that involve a re-design, with screen production a major

concern this year.



Analysts had estimated first-weekend sales of up to 10 million iPhones, after

Apple booked record pre-orders of 4 million on September 12, the day pre-orders

opened.



"Despite the supply chain constraints around the iPhone 6 Plus and tightness

around certain models of the iPhone 6, we believe (Monday's) strong print

demonstrates that Apple executed extremely well in the face of severe supply

constraints," Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White wrote in a note.



First-day pre-orders of the new phones, which went on sale in 10 countries, far

surpassed the two million first-day pre-orders for the iPhone 5 model two years

ago.



"While our team managed the manufacturing ramp better than ever before, we could

have sold many more iPhones with greater supply and we are working hard to fill

orders as quickly as possible," Cook said in a statement.



Last year, Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5S and 5C models in 11 countries,

including China, in the first weekend they were available. Sales of the latest

models in China, the world's largest smartphone market, have been delayed by

regulatory issues.



Apple sold 5 million iPhone 5 handsets, 4 million iPhone 4S models and 1.7

million iPhone 4 units during the first weekend.



The company said last week that many US customers would have to wait until next

month for their new iPhones due to strong demand. The new iPhones will be

available in 20 more countries on September 26.
