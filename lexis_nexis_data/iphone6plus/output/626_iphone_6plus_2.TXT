THEY don't go one sale for another two days but already the iPhone 6 and iPhone

6 Plus have broken records as Apple's most popular smartphones.



Apple has received more than four million pre-orders for the two phones that

have some fans queuing outside of stores ahead of the release on Friday.



That is about double the number of pre-orders for the iPhone 5 when it was

released two years ago.



"Pre-orders for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus set a new record for Apple," Apple's

chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement.



Analysts are predicted Apple will sell up to 10 million iPhones in the first

weekend.The bigger 14cm phablet with the iPhone 6 Plus is the major drawcard.
