

Owners of the new iPhone 6 Plus have complained that the oversized smartphone
bends out of shape if it is carried around in trouser pockets.

Some took to online forums, blogs and social media yesterday to post photographs
of warped handsets, which are the largest and thinnest smartphones that Apple
has ever made.

The iPhone 6 Plus is the bigger brother of the iPhone 6. Both models went on
sale on Friday.

The apparent bending problem is not unique to the iPhone 6 Plus, however. Owners
of certain Samsung Galaxy, BlackBerry and Sony Xperia handsets have also
previously reported problems.

Apple did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.

The hashtag "Bendgate" was trending on Twitter as disgruntled owners posted
pictures of warped phones.

The issue prompted Lewis Hilsenteger, of Unbox Therapy, a YouTube consumer
products channel, to post a video of him bending an iPhone 6 Plus by hand. The
video had more than six million views last night. "Not necessarily the piece of
information that you guys want to receive as brandnew owners of this device," Mr
Hilsenteger said. "This is a huge piece of aluminium and we all know that
aluminium is incredibly malleable - but now we have actual evidence on camera,
not just a picture of a bent phone." He later tested a comparably sized Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 and was unable to do any real damage.

Apple was also forced to roll back the first update to its latest mobile
operating system, IOS 8, which was released on Friday. iPhone owners had
reported dropped reception and a loss of other functions after downloading the
update when it was released yesterday.
