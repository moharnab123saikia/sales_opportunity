Size matters with Samsung, Apple

When Samsung first launched the Galaxy Note in 2011, its 5.3-inch display was

the largest on any smartphone available in Canada. With the Note 4 about to hit

the market, Apple's iPhone 6 Plus seems to be the most obvious head-to-head

competitor. The 6 Plus is the largest iPhone Apple has released thus far,

sporting a 5.5-inch Retina display and an overall size that dwarfs last year's

flagship iPhone 5s. In contrast, Samsung has pushed the envelope on screen size

continuously with the Note line, yet didn't go bigger than last year's model by

sticking to the same 5.7-inch display, albeit with a higher resolution and pixel

density.



It may be hard for the average user to ascertain what to expect from either

device by looking at their respective specs because it's usually the user

experience and familiarity that build loyalty. The iPhone 6 Plus almost looks

and feels like a smaller sibling to the iPad mini, and along with several

improvements provided by the iOS 8 update, its presence is unlike any other

iPhone to date. The Note 4 is considerably more familiar, mainly because it's an

evolutionary upgrade from its predecessors. Even with a more refined design, it

looks similar from front to back, including the faux plastic leather backing and

the S Pen that still slides out of its holster on the bottom right.



Screen size is arguably the deciding factor for most, and in that, Samsung is no

longer the only game in town. The iPhone 6 Plus is probably the easiest Apple

handset to type on, and now that iOS is open to third-party keyboards, the whole

experience is only sure to improve.



The iPhone 6 Plus starts at $375 on a two-year contract or $859 outright for a

16GB.



Pricing for the Galaxy Note 4 has yet to be revealed.
