the largest on any smartphone available in Canada. With the Note 4 about to hit
the market, Apple's iPhone 6 Plus seems to be the most obvious head-to-head
competitor. The 6 Plus is the largest iPhone Apple has released thus far,
sporting a 5.5-inch Retina display and an overall size that dwarfs last year's
flagship iPhone 5s. In contrast, Samsung has pushed the envelope on screen size
continuously with the Note line, yet didn't go bigger than last year's model by
sticking to the same 5.7-inch display, albeit with a higher resolution and pixel
density.

It may be hard for the average user to ascertain what to expect from either
device by looking at their respective specs because it's usually the user
experience and familiarity that build loyalty. The iPhone 6 Plus almost looks
and feels like a smaller sibling to the iPad mini, and along with several
improvements provided by the iOS 8 update, its presence is unlike any other
iPhone to date. The Note 4 is considerably more familiar, mainly because it's an
evolutionary upgrade from its predecessors. Even with a more refined design, it
looks similar from front to back, including the faux plastic leather backing and
the S Pen that still slides out of its holster on the bottom right.

Screen size is arguably the deciding factor for most, and in that, Samsung is no
longer the only game in town. The iPhone 6 Plus is probably the easiest Apple
handset to type on, and now that iOS is open to third-party keyboards, the whole
experience is only sure to improve.

The iPhone 6 Plus starts at $375 on a two-year contract or $859 outright for a
16GB.

Pricing for the Galaxy Note 4 has yet to be revealed.
