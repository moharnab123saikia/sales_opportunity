Thursday, September 25, 2014: It's been days now since Apple announced its

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus for the global customers. After the launch there were

mix reviews coming up from the users about the smartphones and the new iOS 8.

Now when many have got access to their iPhone 6 Plus, we came forth the new

theory of iPhone 6 bend-gate. Yes, you got that right! The new iPhone 6 Plus

bends!



It is not similar to the unique 'bendable' quality seen in the Samsung Galaxy

Round or LG G Flex, instead it's a defect that pertains on keeping the device in

pockets for longer duration. There were number of complaints regarding the

design flaw that affects the top-end area near the volume buttons. Several

reports revealed about the aluminum structure bends upon notwithstanding the

pressure arising from keeping the smartphone tucked in the pockets for longer

duration.



Some people took their complaints to the MacRumors forum while others showed

their frustration through the social networking sites.



Social networking sites are flooded with number of images depicting the design

flow in the new iPhone handsets. People have addressed the issue as bend-gate.



Here comes a piece of advice for all iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users:



Make sure you pull out your device from your pockets before sitting or bending.

You can even safeguard your device with sturdier covers. As of now, there has

been no official statement regarding this issue from Apple.
