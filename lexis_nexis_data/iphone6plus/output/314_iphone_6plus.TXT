well use a hybrid power case, such as the Boostcase.

Available for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the Boostcase consists of a nice-looking
snap case and modular battery sleeve. It is available in black, gold and clear.
We reviewed the black version for the iPhone 6 Plus.

The snap case has several holes on its back for both fashion and function. The
design looks chic and allows the case to be securely attached to the four small
circular lumps on the battery sleeve.

Built into the sleeve is a 2,700mAh rechargeable battery with a Lightning
connector. At the base of the sleeve is a micro-USB port for charging, a power
switch and a touch-activated LED strip battery indicator.

It is easy to snap the case on, but it takes some force to pry it off the
battery sleeve.

At the left side of the base is a rather deep inlet for the smartphone's 3.5mm
audio jack. A headphone adaptor is bundled with the case.

With the snap case attached to the battery sleeve, the package is rather thick
at 18mm. The snap case itself adds only 2.7mm to the smartphone.

In my test, the Boostcase was able to charge my iPhone 6 Plus from 30 per cent
to full power in 2hr 20min, exhausting its battery in the process.

But this was done with the screen brightness set at maximum, and Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi switched on, while I checked frequently for e-mail and social media
updates. With less intensive usage, the Boostcase topped up my iPhone 6 Plus to
full power from 20 per cent and still had about a quarter tank left in reserve.

The Boostcase is a great solution to the protection and power needs of your
iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus with its chic and modular design.
