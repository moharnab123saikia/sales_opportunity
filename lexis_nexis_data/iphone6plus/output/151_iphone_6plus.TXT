More buyers are picking Apple Inc.'s iPhone 6 Plus over the iPhone 6 in this

debut weekend, according to a Piper Jaffray Cos. survey, and supplies of the

larger model already are selling out in some U.S. stores.



The iPhone 6 Plus is "more popular," Gene Munster, an analyst for Piper Jaffray

in Minneapolis, said in a report today. The survey of 386 Apple customers

waiting in line in Minneapolis and New York yesterday found that 57 percent

intended to buy the iPhone 6 Plus, he said. Munster said he had expected buyers

to split 50-50 between the models this weekend and shift more in favor of the

smaller phone over time.



More buyers also said they would pay for higher storage capacity for either

phone than for the iPhone 5S last year. The survey showed 22 percent choosing 16

gigabytes, 52 percent picking 64 GB and 26 percent opting for 128 GB. Last year,

35 percent planned to buy 16 GB, 39 percent intended to get 64 GB and 25 percent

wanted 128 GB, Munster said.



The shift to higher storage capacity and larger phones "will provide an

incremental benefit to gross margins," Munster said. That should help revenue

outpace analysts' average estimate by 9 percent and earnings estimates by almost

12 percent in the three months through December, he said.
