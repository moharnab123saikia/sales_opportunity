WHEN Apple CEO Tim Cook launches the iPhone 7 today, it will be a case of the

same iPhone you know but with more and less.



The more is expected to be a dual lens camera in the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus

"phablet" and the less is the expected removal of the headphone jack in the

iPhone 7 range, something that will make the phones slimmer but will also mean

people will be scrambling for an adaptor to plug in their favourite earphones.



It would be a genuine surprise if the iPhone 7 Plus did not have a dual lens

camera.



It could mean clearer pictures in a camera that works better in low light or it

could be an optical zoom. Time, and Tim Cook, will tell.



The leaks suggest the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will have a similar form factor to the

iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, aside from moving the antenna strip from the back of the

phone, the addition of the extra lens in the bigger phone and a second speaker

likely to replace the headphone port.Apple is expected to release new headphones

with the iPhone with some tipping a new style of wireless beats called AirPods,

based on leaked reports of registered trade names ahead of today's event.
