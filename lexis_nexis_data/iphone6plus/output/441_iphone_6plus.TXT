EAGER gadget fans in Belfast queued in droves to be the first to get their hands

on the new iPhone 6 (£539-£699) and 6 Plus (£619-£789) which went on sale

yesterday.



At the Apple store in Victoria Square people young and old waited patiently to

purchase the coveted new smartphone. Across the UK many people camped overnight

to be among the first to get their hands on Apple''s first tablet-style iPhone

with a screen measuring 5.5-inches diagonally.



The iPhone 6 Plus is the biggest ever iPhone, but it is thinner than the iPhone

5s.



Where the iPhone 5s was 7.6mm thin, the iPhone 6 Plus is just 7.1mm. The iPhone

6 is even smaller at 6.9mm.



Apple says the iPhone is "still comfortable to hold and easy to use".



Meanwhile, Irish band U2 have come in for criticism from 'Bono bashers' across

the globe for the band''s decision to accept a multimillion pound deal with

Apple, who then gave away their new album - Songs Of Innocence - for free on

iTunes.



Some angry Apple customers have complained that they could not remove the

band''s free album download easily if they did not want to have it.
