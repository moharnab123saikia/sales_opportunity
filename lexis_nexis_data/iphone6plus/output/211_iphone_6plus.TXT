Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus





The newest iPhone comes in two versions, the 12-centimetre iPhone 6 and the 14cm

iPhone 6 Plus, which is inching toward a phablet. Is it time to upgrade? Well,

with Canada's new two-year contracts, consumers may be upgrading their phones

more often - and if you're still using a 4S or 5, you'll likely find the

improvements worthwhile. The unlocked Apple phones aren't cheap - starting at

$749 for a 16GB iPhone, all the way up to the top-of-the-line 128GB iPhone 6

Plus at $1079. Subsidies for a two-year contract drop that down to $265 and

$595. For that, you get a number of enhancements, besides the size differential,

over earlier iPhones.



A notable addition is near-field communication, a standard used in mobile

payments and one you might not notice until Apple brings its new Apple Pay to

Canada. The camera is key on all smartphones. The new iPhone's back-facing

camera is still eight megapixels, but the iPhone Plus has optical image

stabilization, not just the digital stabilization of the iPhone 6 and earlier

iPhones. It also has a better panorama, slow motion video of 120 frames per

second or 240 fps, compared to the 5S's 120 fps. It also has the ability to make

calls using Wi-Fi and switch mid-call to a cellular network if you leave your

home or office or Wi-Fi area - a feature not yet available in Canada, but it

would be useful if it gets here. Apple promises improved battery life and

depending on the phone you're using now, you may notice the improved screen

display - the 6 Plus has a 920 by 1080 resolution with 401 pixels per inch and

the iPhone 6 has a 1334 by 750 resolution and 326 ppi.



Nokia Lumia 830



While Apple was packing in the crowds in Cupertino, Calif., other companies were

showing offtheir latest products at the giant IFA consumer electronics show in

Berlin. Microsoft, which bought Nokia's devices business last spring, introduced

three new Windows phones. The Lumia 830, at 330 euros, is billed as an

affordable alternative to the pricey premium smartphones. That translates to

close to $500, so it's not cheap, although it's less than the $749 entry-level

iPhone 6. It has a 13cm 1280x720 screen with 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. The

10 megapixel back-facing camera has optical image stabilization, although the

front-camera is only 1MP.



Lumia 735 and Lumia 730 Dual SIM



Microsoft also introduced two phones that are identical in design with

differences in network connectivity. Like the Lumia 830, these run the latest

Windows Phone 8.1 operating system. The 735 works with LTE and thus is the one

more likely to show up in Canada. Both phones have a 12cm 720 display screen,

with only 8GB in storage although you can boost that by 128GB with a microSD

card. The rear-facing camera is a 6.7MP with Carl Zeiss optics and, in following

the trend in making it easier to take selfies, it has a 5MP wide-angle

front-facing camera.



HTC Desire 820



Another in the upsized smartphone market, the newly announced HTC Desire 820

matches the 14cm size of Apple iPhone 6 Plus and is the successor to the 816,

which is currently available on Amazon.ca around $580. At 720p, the screen

resolution isn't as high as the 6 Plus. The 820 has HTC's dual front-facing

BoomSound speakers, a microSD slot, a 13MP rear-facing camera and an 8MP

front-facing camera - again, it's all about the selfies.
