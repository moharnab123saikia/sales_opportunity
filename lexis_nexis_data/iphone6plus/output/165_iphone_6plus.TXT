iPhones probably made you really happy Tuesday.

Set for release on Sept. 19, the iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, and larger
iPhone 6 Plus, has a 5.5-inch screen.

Thanks to the bigger body, the battery life for the iPhone 6 Plus "is
significantly better," than the previous iPhone 5s, says Gene Munster, an
analyst with Piper Jaffray. "Battery life (on the iPhone 6 Plus) will be a big
selling point for people."

The battery life on the smaller iPhone 6 will be only "marginally" better than
the 5s, says Munster. Apple put up a chart at its iPhone event unveiling of how
battery life will be different. Apple says video playback on the iPhone 6 will
be 11% less taxing on the battery than the iPhone 5s, vs. a 14% improvement on
the larger iPhone, while talk time goes 14% longer on  iPhone 6, vs. 24% for the
iPhone Plus.
