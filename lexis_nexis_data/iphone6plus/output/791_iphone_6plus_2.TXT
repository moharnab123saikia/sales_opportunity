IS THAT a bent iPhone 6 Plus in your pocket or are you just not so happy to see

an unwanted feature in your new Apple phablet?



Just days after the most successful launch of an iPhone for Apple come

unconfirmed reports from some disgruntled iPhone 6 Plus owners who say their

phone has developed a kink from bending in their hip pocket when they sit down.



Users have circulated images online of iPhone 6 Plus phones with a distinct bend

in them.



One person, identifying themselves as Hanzoh on the Mac-rumours forum, said he

took his new phone to a wedding, which involved eight hours of driving, dancing

and sitting at dinner.



"As I lay it on the coffee table and sat down on the couch to relax from the

drive (yes, sitting again), I saw the reflection of the window in the iPhones

slightly distorted."Apple has yet to comment on the claims that the super-slim

14cm (5.5-inch) phone is prone to bending into unwanted shapes but there have

been suggestions from some that if you're a bloke planning to get an iPhone 6

Plus, you might want to carry it in a man purse.
