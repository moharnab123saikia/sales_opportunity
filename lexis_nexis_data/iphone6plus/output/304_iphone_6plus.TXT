eircom Group, which operates the Meteor and eMobile brands, today announced it
will offer the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to customers on Friday, September 26.

"We are delighted to offer the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to our Meteor and eMobile
customers. Apple is an incredibly popular brand with our customers and the
anticipation of these new handsets has been unprecedented," Niall Dorrian,
Director of Mobile, eircom, said.

After its gala, U2-launched unveiling last night, the iPhone 6 has had
favourable reviews from the tech and consumer world.

TechRadar's Gareth Beavis said the iPhone 6 represents "a seismic shift for
Apple" - placing the iPhone in harder competition to even the best of the
Android and Windows Phone handsets on the market. Of the updated A8 processor,
Beavis said: "In terms of the performance advantage Apple has given itself, the
new A8 processor certainly seems up to the task." He was also glowing about the
phone's "sleek and rounded sides" - but worries that the slippier handset could
lead to accidents. IGN's 's Justin Rubio, too, was fulsome in his praise of the
phone's new rounded design. He said: "The rounded edges of the unibody casing
made it so my hands naturally curved around the phone." For more visit:
