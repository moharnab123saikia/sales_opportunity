their larger screens and software updates-

Both the devices, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, have a new sensor on the
camera with something called Focus Pixels, an addition that enables
significantly faster auto-focusing and more accurate colors. Other features
include manual exposure controls, slower and crisper slow motion shooting, video
stabilization and higher-resolution panoramas. The iPhone 6 Plus, the bigger of
the two phones, also has optical image stabilization for reducing blur and
allowing longer exposures in lowlight situations.

As many an amateur photographer has discovered, however, simply owning a better
camera doesn't always produce better shots. So to determine whether the iPhone 6
cameras are a true improvement over their already good predecessors, I shipped
my review units to Todd Heisler, a staff photographer at The New York Times.

Mr. Heisler said the size of the iPhone 6 Plus made it too unwieldy to use on a
daily basis, so he stuck to testing the iPhone 6. He said he didn't miss the
added features.

Mr. Heisler said the camera on the iPhone 6 was closer to his professional gear
than ever before, because of the slider that lets you fine-tune exposure even
when you're rolling video and built-in tools for fine-tuning light, exposure,
contrast and color. And he said that because of those controls, there's no need
to turn to third-party camera apps that can be more complicated to use.

Professional photographers like Mr. Heisler probably won't be shelving their pro
cameras for iPhones yet. But don't be surprised if they pull one out on the job.
