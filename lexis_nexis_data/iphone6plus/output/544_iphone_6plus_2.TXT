The new iPhones have gotten almost as much attention for their cameras as for

their larger screens and software updates-



Both the devices, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, have a new sensor on the

camera with something called Focus Pixels, an addition that enables

significantly faster auto-focusing and more accurate colors. Other features

include manual exposure controls, slower and crisper slow motion shooting, video

stabilization and higher-resolution panoramas. The iPhone 6 Plus, the bigger of

the two phones, also has optical image stabilization for reducing blur and

allowing longer exposures in lowlight situations.



As many an amateur photographer has discovered, however, simply owning a better

camera doesn't always produce better shots. So to determine whether the iPhone 6

cameras are a true improvement over their already good predecessors, I shipped

my review units to Todd Heisler, a staff photographer at The New York Times.



Mr. Heisler said the size of the iPhone 6 Plus made it too unwieldy to use on a

daily basis, so he stuck to testing the iPhone 6. He said he didn't miss the

added features.



Mr. Heisler said the camera on the iPhone 6 was closer to his professional gear

than ever before, because of the slider that lets you fine-tune exposure even

when you're rolling video and built-in tools for fine-tuning light, exposure,

contrast and color. And he said that because of those controls, there's no need

to turn to third-party camera apps that can be more complicated to use.



Professional photographers like Mr. Heisler probably won't be shelving their pro

cameras for iPhones yet. But don't be surprised if they pull one out on the job.
