The next iPhones will not bend



By tbreak Staff -



Reliable tech analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports that Apple plans to use the stronger

7000 series aluminum/zync materials for the next Apple iPhone 6S and the Apple

iPhone 6S Plus. These new materials are aimed to address the BendGate issues

that the present iPhone 6/ iPhone 6 Plus users have faced.



Kuo mentions that the materials could make the next iPhones slightly bigger at

0.2mm more thickness, and 0.15mm taller. Apple will also be adding the new Force

Touch technology for the next iPhones as well.



The anticipated Apple iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus is expected to feature a

revamped 12MP camera, a new A9 processor, 2GB of RAM, sharper display and a new

Rose Gold color option too in the premium segment. The new devices are expected

to be announced by the fourth quarter of this year.



There were also reports that Apple is considering to implement the iPhone 6S

with a 4.7-inch display with 1080p resolution, and the bigger iPhone 6S Plus

with a 5.5-inch 1440p resolution display. The new Apple A9 processor will be

fabricated under Samsung's 14nm FinFET processor. So expect the new fabrication

to come with improved power consumption and heat dissipation.
