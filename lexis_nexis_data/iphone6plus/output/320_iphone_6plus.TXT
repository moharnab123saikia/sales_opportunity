NEW DELHI: Remember the brouhaha over Apple iPhone 6 Plus being prone to

bending. The 'bendgate' controversy that made Apple issue a statement and other

smartphone makers poking fun at the smartphone giant.



But as it turns out, Samsung and HTC's latest flagship phones Samsung Galaxy S6

edge and HTC One M9 are no less prone to bending then Apple iPhone 6 Plus.



US-based electronics insurance company SquareTrade subjected Samsung Galaxy S6

edge, the new HTC One M9 and iPhone 6 Plus to the same pressure test.



The company put these devices through a torture test using its 'Bendbot' machine

to see when they would bend and ultimately break. Galaxy S6 edge reached its

bending point at 110 pounds of pressure, same as that of iPhone 6 Plus.



Here HTC's new One M9 proved better than both the competition, bending at 120

pounds of pressure.



However, when it comes to breaking point, Apple iPhone 6 Plus turned out to be

better than both S6 edge and One M9. While One M9 ceased to function after being

exerted to 120 pounds of pressure, Samsung Galaxy S6 edge reached its failure

point at 149 pounds.



Apple iPhone 6 Plus beat its rivals, working normally until exerted with 179

pounds of force.



Here's the SquareTrade's video where you can see the performance of all the

three smartphones yourself:
