6 Plus. A midnight launch event will be held tomorrow at Vodafone's store in the
Villaggio Mall.

Vodafone Qatar will also give 10 people, who will join the event, the chance to
get their mobile bill paid for one year.

The midnight event will last until 3am on Saturday. Actual sales of the iPhone 6
and iPhone 6 Plus will begin at 1am on Saturday and will last until the stocks
are finished.

Ticketing will open at 11.30pm tomorrow, and there will be three ticketing
lines, each one allocated to cater, respectively, Vodafone Red VIP customers,
pre-order customers who have chosen Villaggio Mall as their pick-up point for
their handset, and walk-in customers. Customers can enter Villaggio Mall from
Gate 4. Red VIP customers will need to show their Red VIP cards upon arrival and
will be directly welcomed to a dedicated waiting area.

Walk-in customers are advised to show up as early as possible as the sales of
the handsets will be available on a first come, first serve basis.

Vodafone Qatar will be offering the iPhone 6 starting at QR2,799 and the iPhone
6 Plus starting at QR 3,199.
