The iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus are now available to pre-order from both the
telcos in the UAE. Etisalat and du have both of the latest phones from Apple on
their website with a release date set for September 27. Apple's UAE store is
also reporting the same release date but there is no option to pre-order,
although, prices are a bit lower when ordering directly from Apple compared to
Etisalat and du. Interesting, there are no packaged deals for subsidised prices
from du or Etisalat this year and you have to pay the full price of the device
upfront whether you chose the pre-paid or post-paid option.

The following table compares the prices (in AED) for Apple UAE Store as well as
Etisalat and du:
