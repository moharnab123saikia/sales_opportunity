NEW DELHI: Apple has launched its two new iPhone models - iPhone 6S and iPhone

6S Plus in India. It's worth mentioning that this is the fastest iPhone rollout

in India with the phones being made available less than a month after being

going on sale in the US.



The iPhone 6S will be available at Rs 62,000 for the 16GB version, Rs 72,000 for

the 64GB version, and Rs 82,000 for the 128GB storage variant. The iPhone 6S

Plus has been priced at Rs 72,000 for the 16GB version, Rs 82,000 for the 64GB

version, and Rs 92,000 for the 128GB variant. Note that these prices are MRP

rates.



The phones will be retailed by Apple's four main iPhone distributors across

12,000 retail outlets, including large format retail chains such as Croma,

Reliance Digital and Jumbo, besides the e-commerce players such as Flipkart,

Snapdeal and Amazon.



With the launch of iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, prices of the previous generation

iPhones have already been slashed. The iPhone 6 now has an MRP of Rs 52,000 for

16GB and Rs 62,000 for 64GB versions. The 6 Plus is available at an MRP of Rs

62,000 for 16GB and Rs72,000 for 64GB versions



Along with the standard silver, space gray and gold colours, iPhone 6S and 6S

Plus have also been launched in a new rose gold hue.



While there is no increment in screen size in iPhone 6S (4.7-inch HD) and iPhone

6S (5.5-inch Full HD) compared to last year's models, the phones feature a new

3D Touch display technology, which allows the screen panel to differentiate

between types of touches and taps in preloaded apps as well as on the

homescreen.



Both iPhones are powered by the new A9 processor with 2GB RAM (reported) and run

iOS 9 operating system. The new 64-bit A9 chipset is 70% faster at carrying out

processes than the one on last year's iPhones. Similarly, the graphics

processing will be 90% faster.



While the phones come in 3 storage variants - 16, 64, and 128GB, there is no

support for microSD cards for storage expansions.



One of the biggest upgrades to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus is in the cameras.

The rear cameras of the two smartphones have 12MP resolution, backed by

dual-tone dual-LED flash, while the front cameras have 5MP sensors. A new camera

feature of iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus is Live Photos, which can turn photos

into short videos. The rear camera has also got 4K recording to capture

high-resolution videos.



According to Apple, the iPhone 6S delivers up to 14 hours talk time on 3G and up

to 10 days standby time. The 6S Plus offers up to 24 hours talk time on 3G and

up to 16 days standby time.



The new iPhones feature faster-second-generation TouchID sensor and are made of

tough aircraft grade aluminium, same as Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge.



The phones support most popular connectivity options, including 4G LTE.
