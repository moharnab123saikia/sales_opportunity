Ufone, known for its innovation, together with Faysal Bank Limited (FBL), one of

the leading banks in Pakistan, has launched the industry's first iPhone-based

installment plan of the year, whereby customers could own an iPhone 6 along with

telecom goodies for as low as Rs. 5,000/ month inclusive of all taxes, that too

without any upfront cost.



Customers would also be able to avail 1000 on net minutes, 150 off net minutes,

1000 SMS and 3GB data, all inclusive in the monthly installment plan. Customers

could choose between 18 months and 24 months payment plans for any iPhone 6 or

iPhone 6 Plus.



Regarding this exciting new launch, Mr. Khurram Mahboob, Head of HVC at Ufone

said, "This innovative endeavor would ensure that these latest, classy, and most

sought after Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are within easy reach of our esteemed

customers."



"It is because of our valuable partnership with FBL that we've been able to

offer these tailor made solutions to facilitate our customers, where they can

now avail both; seamless connectivity coupled with a new Apple gadgetry."



Expressing his views, Mr. Ahmed Hemani, Head of Products and Marketing, FBL

said, "Ufone's inclination towards uniqueness and innovation has compelled us to

extend our partnership with the telecom operator, as its vision is in-line with

our vision of putting customers first and providing them with quality

solutions."



It is another successful year that both Ufone and FBL have extended their

partnership in offering smartphone solutions at affordable rates, earlier in

2013; both parties launched Postpay Smartphone Plan featuring Blackberry and

Samsung mobile phones.
