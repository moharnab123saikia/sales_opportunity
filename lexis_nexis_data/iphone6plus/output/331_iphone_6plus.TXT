

Apple says that it has processed a record number of pre-orders for the iPhone 6
and iPhone 6 Plussince the new devices went on sale just after midnight on
Friday.

A representative for the Cupertino tech giant told Recodethat the "response to
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been incredible with a record number of preorders
overnight." The company has not announced how many units it has sold of the new
device. The last time it announced pre-order sales was in 2012 when the iPhone 5
topped more than 2 million orders in its first 24 hours.

Strong pre-sales does not necessarily indicate the the iPhone 6 will surpass
previous phone sales, but it's a good sign that the new model is on its way to
becoming a hit. And the demand is notable. The larger iPhone 6 Plus model
appears to be sold out, with the Apple Store and all major carriers reporting
shipping delays.

That demand has caused some problems for customers itching to get their hands on
the new devices. The Apple Store website was down for many customers, and it
wasn't necessarily easier to purchase the phone through the major carriers.
Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless and AT&T all experienced outages or delays
during the early hours of the morning.

The iPhone 6 goes on sale Sept. 19 in more than 100 countries, starting at $199
with a two-year carrier contract. The iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299.
