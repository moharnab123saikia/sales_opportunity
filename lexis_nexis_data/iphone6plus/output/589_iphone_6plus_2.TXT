HIGHLIGHT:Â Suppliers have recently started initial production of iPhone models.





Apple is planning to ramp up production of its new iPhone units to record

levels. The company has reportedly asked suppliers to manufacture between 85

million and 90 million units by the end of this year.



Last year, Apple ordered 70 million to 80 million units of its iPhone 6 and 6

Plus smartphones.



The new phones will have the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen and exterior

design as the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.



It was reported last month that suppliers had commenced initial production of

iPhone models with Force Touch technology, which is already used in the Apple

Watch and new MacBook Pros.



The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is also considering to hire a third

assembler, Taiwan-based Wistron, to help manufacture the new phones.



Last year, the company primarily depended on Hon Hai Precision Industry and

Pegatron for assembling its devices.



People familiar with the matter told the Journal that some component suppliers

began manufacturing parts for the new iPhone units in large quantity earlier

this month.



The sales of iPhone units increased 40% in March to 61.2 million. Apple, with

its advanced big screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, pushed Samsung from its top

position as the top smartphone manufacturer in the world.
