It's just amazing how iPhones are able to sell millions of units Worldwide at

the prices they come at - After death of Steve Jobs, many people had thought

that iPhone aura will diminish - but that's not happened. The sales of iPhone

are setting record after record, even though each and every iteration of iPhone

is getting increasingly expensive.



According to various media outlets, for the first time, Apple is planning a

blockbuster launch for it's newest iPhone 6S and 6 Plus in India. The launch

event is expected to happen on October 16th of this month.



But the prices of iPhone 6S and 6+ has already been revealed and the cheapest

iPhone 6S (16GB) will put you down by Rs. 62,000 - nearly $1000! On the other

end the most expensive unit will be iPhone 6 plus 128 GB that will have a price

tag of whopping Rs. 92,000 or close to $1450.



Here is the price list for all versions:



Even though the price of iPhone is so high, Apple expects better sale numbers in

India compared to all previous versions. In India, iPhone is just not a

smartphone - it is a device that is bought to be flaunted and has the highest

"richness" quotient!



While, most consumers know that Apple themselves make over $500 profit

(http://trak.in/tags/business/2015/10/01/apple-earning-513-iphone-6s-

plus-iphones-smash-sales-record/) on each of their phone, people still make a

beeline in front of Apple stores worldwide.



Growing India Importance



It is also for the first time that Apple is forging partnerships with Indian

telecom operators well in advance of launch date. Till now, iPhone plans

released by operators came out months later from the launch date.



Like always, Apple will be offering EMI Schemes, where consumers will need to

pay only a small upfront amount and rest can be paid in 12 or 24 month

installments. It is expected that iPhone plans will come with bundled data

offers or even unlimited data in case of some plans.



There is a reason why Apple no more looks at India as a dumping ground for

iPhones. For the first time in history, the growth of Apple products, especially

iPhones, has been more in India compared with China

(http://trak.in/tags/business/2015/07/23/apple-india-market-growth-overtakes-chi

na/). For the period between April to June, 2015, iPhones recorded a growth of

93% in India, which more than growth in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Turkey

and China.



So, what's your take? Will you buy iPhones at that price?
