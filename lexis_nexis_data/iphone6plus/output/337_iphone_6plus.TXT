Apple is yet to find a date to launch its latest Iphone 6 and Iphone 6 Plus in

India, but that does not stops sellers from selling the device. The handset has

been spotted at multiple online stores today at price points above INR 56K.



[NOTE: Apple is yet to make an official announcement on availability of iPhone 6

and 6 Plus in India. Prices will be announced at the time of this announcement.

DailyBhaksar.com  advises you to wait for Apple to make these available at

authorized Apple resellers and retail stores and does not recommend you to buy

the handset today.]



At ShopClues the 16 GB model is priced at INR 59,999. The store gives a shipping

date when you enter the pin number. But it does mention "actual delivery time

may vary based on product availability with the selling merchant, shipping

address, and courier or any other delivery issues." Check here.



On eBay the handset was spotted before the launch in September. Today you can

find multiple posts on eBay where sellers are selling iPhone 6 and 6 Plus at

varying price points.  The 16 GB iPhone 6 4.7 inch is available at INR 56K, 64

GB is available at INR 67,400. The iPhone 6 Plus 64GB is at INR 92,250 and

128GB is available at INR 96,000. We have mentioned prices of only a few sellers

here, but you could find a dozen on listings on the eBay webpage. Check here.



Spice Mobile retail Saholic and Infibeam has listed the handset as coming soon.



At snapdeal too we spotted the new iPhone 6 16 GB variant at INR 63, 999.



On Rediff shopping there were three sellers with iPhone 6 priced at above INR

68000.
