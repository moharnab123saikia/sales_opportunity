Touchscreen chip flaw renders some iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices useless;

Scores of users complain of broken or unresponsive screens, which repair

specialists report is down to a widespread flaw in touchscreen chips

Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus appear to be vulnerable to so-called "touch

disease", a hardware problem that is crippling phones, according to reports from

users and third-party repairers.



The issue, which has been observed in iPhone 6s since the beginning of the year,

seems to affect the touchscreen controller chips, resulting in problems for the

high-end smartphones in responding to touch input.



Badly affected phones become next to useless. First the status bar becomes grey

and flickers and the touchscreen becomes unresponsive, with users unable to

control or use the smartphones without the touchscreen working.



On the eve of Apple's unveiling of its next version of the iPhone, an extensive

report by third-party repair resource iFixit has suggested the issue is

widespread.



iFixit repair advocate Julia Bluff said : "Of course, there's no way to tell

exactly how many phones are afflicted with what we're calling Touch Disease, but

every repair tech we spoke to told us that the problem is incredibly common."



"This issue is widespread enough that I feel like almost every iPhone 6 or 6

Plus has a touch of it (no pun intended) and are like ticking bombs just waiting

to act up," Jason Villmer, owner of repair shop STS Telecom, told iFixit.



A fix for the issue is possible, requiring the broken chips within the iPhones

to be carefully replaced by workshops capable of performing so-called

microsoldering - the use of microscopes and very fine soldering irons to remove

and replace tiny chips on the main boards of the iPhones.



The microsoldering repair specialist Jessa Jones puts the fault down to the same

reason the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus suffered from bending issues. Their thin, wide

bodies flex more than previous Apple smartphones and the flex point appears to

be around where the touchscreen controllers sit within the smartphones. Apple

has since strengthened the structure of its iPhones to correct the issue with

2015's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.



Jones said: "Over time, normal daily use of the large, thin phone will

eventually create a small crack or separation in one of the balls that underlie

either of the [touchscreen control] chips on the board. At first, there may be

no defect at all. Later you might notice that the screen is sometimes

unresponsive, but it is quick to come back with a hard reset. As the crack

deepens into a full separation of the chip/board bond, the periods of no touch

function become more frequent. This is exacerbated by any drop."



Pressure on the screen or twisting of the phone can work as a temporary fix, as

can so-called reflowing of the chip, where it is heated up to try and reform

broken bonds, reconnecting the chip to the board beneath it. But the problem

will get worse over time, eventually rendering the touchscreen unresponsive.



Jones explained that the only solution is to replace both touchscreen control

chip, cleaning the board underneath, which should cost about the same as a

screen replacement or a quarter of the cost of Apple's out-of-warranty

refurbished phone replacement offer.



Apple's in-store support are not capable of doing so, leaving those out of

warranty with little recourse but to buy a new or refurbished smartphone,

according to users of Apple's support forums.



While Apple store staff have reportedly told users affected by the issue that it

is a known problem, the company has not officially acknowledged the issue.



Apple did not respond to request for comment.
