"This is the first time that Apple handsets have been launched officially in

Nepal. Now customer will be benefited with Apple's genuine after-sales service

and global warranty," Pranay Raj Acharya, B2B director of Ncell, said. Acharya

further added that the prices are costs of handsets alone, and Ncell SIM and

data that come with the handsets ensure additional value.
