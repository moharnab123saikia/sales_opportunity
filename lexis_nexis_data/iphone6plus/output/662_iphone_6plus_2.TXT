No Diwali season sale for Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus



LENGTH: 431  words





Last week we reported that Apple has Apple will skip the major festival season

sale in India.



After a huge round of sale of about 10 million Iphone 6 after launch, the

company was pushing the launch of its new iPhones, and is not likely to launch

the iPhone 6and Iphone 6 Plus before November. This push was expected as the

company was aiming to first deliver units of iPhones to markets where these are

high on demand.  But, this indicated that the company will miss the Diwali sale

season giving ample reasons to Samsung, Xiaomi, Nokia and others to feast upon

the sale season.



This week news is coming the Indian team of Apple wasnts to launch the iPhone 6

in India before Diwali sale season while the Parent Apple company is pushing the

launch further. "While the parent wants to delay the launch to early November

due to unprecedented demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in the US and the China

launch likely next week, the India team and distributors in the country want to

make the most of upcoming festive demand by launching it before Diwali", a

report in Times of India says today.



The intention to launch the new Apple phones before Diwali does seem justified

since this festive season is actually the beginning of three sale season in

India, beginning with Diwali. These are -  (1) Diwali in October, Chirstmas (2)

New Year in December end (3) since the GOSF online shopping festival was

organized in middle of December last year, we expect GOSF this year too in

December.



Around Diwali we have lot of launches and new products lining up for sale, and

to be able to get some share of this year end market one needs to be a part of

it. Here are the list of new launches or that happened recently or going to

launched very soon -
