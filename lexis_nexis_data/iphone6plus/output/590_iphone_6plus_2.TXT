Saturday, September 27, 2014: We have seen lots of complaints coming over by
iPhone 6 Plus users about the 'Bendgate' issue. Apple finally responded after
withdrawing the software update while the company continuously puts in efforts
to revive the momentum of its newly launched smartphones sale.

The phone has observed criticism over its bendability issue, known as
'bendgate'. There were many pictures and comments released on social media
platforms by iPhone 6 Plus users about the issue.

Apple has said that the iPhone has steel and titanium inserts to support
high-stress locations. It stated that they have used the strongest glass in the
smartphone industry. Laban Roomes, chief executive of Goldgenie, which
customizes and gold plates iPhones told that the only way that may lead an
iPhone to bend is when someone keeps it in their back pocket and sit for a
longer time duration.

As mentioned on The Times of India, Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said in an
e-mail, "With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our
first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a
bent iPhone 6 Plus." While showing concerns over the issue, she further added,
"We apologize for the great inconvenience experienced by users."

Apple has stated on its website that they are working to fix the issue of iOS 8
update and will release it within next few days. Quoting an Apple support
executive, Tech news website The Next Web reported that, customers who have
observed the bent gate issue can hope for replacements for their bent iPhones
depending on whether their devices passed an inspection.
