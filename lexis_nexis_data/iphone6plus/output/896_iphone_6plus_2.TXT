Apple has leapt to the defence of its iPhone 6 Plus as social media was abuzz

with allegations that it bends easily. The company said that only nine people

had complained about a bent smartphone. It said that the iPhone 6 Plus passed

stress tests. "With normal use a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through

our first six days of sale, nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent

iPhone 6 Plus," said spokesman Adam Howorth.
