<p>BEIJING -- Strong demand for Apple's latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus
smartphones has helped the Chinese market outsell the United States for the
first time, according to tech news hub pingwest.com citing a report from
investment banking firm UBS.

Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, said iPhone demand saw outsized growth
in China and China could constitute as much as 35 percent of shipments in the
last quarter of 2014, way higher than the 24 percent ratio of the US market.
During the same period last year, China's market share was 22 percent.

Apple only began selling iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus in the China market on Oct
17, but Chinese consumers' preference for larger sized phones made the devices
the most popular sold in China. Orders reached 10 million within three days
after the initial sell date on JD.com, a major e-commerce platform.

The UBS report estimates Apple sold 69.3 million iPhones in the last quarter of
2014, a new quarter record.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a trip to China in October that "it's just a
matter of time" before China "becomes Apple's biggest revenue contributor." Cook
also said Apple would increase its number of Apple retail stores in China from
15 to 40 in the next few years.
