including Azerbaijan.

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus entered the local markets with a record price two
weeks after the grand show. However, there are reports that over 200 iPhones
have already been sold in a couple of days.

Apple production is taking the second place in the smart phones market of the
country, after Samsung. However, a significant 50.57 percent growth was recorded
in Apple's share at the local market in first eight months of 2014.

Japan was the only country that started the sale of the new 4.7inches device
with the lowest $636 price, while the highest prices were registered in Germany
and France, $906 and $919 respectively.

The price of iPhone 6 in Russia starts from $831, while in Dubai (UAE) the price
of the new device started from $707.

However, the price in Azerbaijan broke all the records, with the sale starting
from $2,000 to $2,500 for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. This price was high even
for Azerbaijanis. However, the high price could not stop the their desire to be
the first iPhone 6 owners.

New models arrived in Azerbaijan on September 20 and were put on sale on
September 22. Just in a day, the price fell to $1,500 in Baku. One of the
leading phone store owners said, over 20 phones were sold in just 2 days.

New iPhones are now available in many places in Baku. The prices vary, however,
the official Apple distributor in the country, Alma Store is still waiting for
the new devices.

Apple's full lineup of phone now consists of the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 5s and 5c  a
relatively cheaper plastic model that the company did not update in its most
recent launch. Instead it decided to lower the cost (often free with a contract)
in order to target less affluent customers.

The introduction of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus was one of the leading topics around
the world on September 9.
