Apple sold 10 million handsets in the first weekend of Iphone 6 and Iphone 6

Plus's debut in the market. It also entered the Chinese and Indian market as it

hit the pre-order status on 7th this month and will go on shelves on the 17th

(ahead of festive season sale in India and new year sale season in China).



In China it has witnessed pre-orders for more than 4.85 million new Apple

handsets, according to the Chinese live tracking website JD.com, reports Cult of

Mac. Though figures of the new iPhone bookings in India are yet to arrive, the

handsets  are sure to make it big in India this year.



Amidst this news DigiTimes (via industry sources) report that the Cupertino

giant has asked chipset suppliers to increase the production of chips for Apple

devices, to churn out up to 200-250 million units of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus

and Watch.



The report says "Deducting some 30-40 million units of chips for the Apple

Watch, shipments of related chips will be enough for production of over 200

million units of iPhone 6 devices, meeting Apple's goal of shipping the same

amount of iPhone 6 and iPhone6 Plus, said the sources, noting that Apple is

likely to reach the goal much earlier than expected."
