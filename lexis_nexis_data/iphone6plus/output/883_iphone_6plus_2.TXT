Apple is today launching a tough new iPhone 6 with an aluminium casing to

prevent a repetition of "Bendgate".



Some iPhone 6 Plus mobiles warped when put in back pockets, but the iPhone 6s

and 6s Plus are designed to stay in shape.



Prices are expected to start from £539 for the 6S and £619 for the 6s Plus.



Apple is also set to unveil a king-size, 12.9in iPad and a 12.2ins iPad Air Plus

to take on Microsoft's 12ins Surface Pro 3.



A cheaper gold Apple Watch is also on the cards.



Is this a tantalising glimpse of the iPhone 6s?
