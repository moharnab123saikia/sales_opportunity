LENGTH: 239  words





Ooredoo will officially launch iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus this weekend, it was

announced yesterday. The next generation iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are the biggest

advancements in iPhone history yet, featuring the A8 chip, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch

Retina HD displays, and an all-new thin design.



"The 4G enabled devices will work seamlessly with Ooredoo's world-class 4G

network, giving customers access to superfast mobile data speeds and the

smoothest browsing experience in Qatar," a statement said.



For the iPhone 6, customers can choose from the 16GB model in silver, space grey

or gold for QR2,799, the 64GB device for QR3,199, or the 128GB for QR3,599. The

larger iPhone 6 Plus will cost QR3,199 for the 16GB model (all colours), QR3,599

for the 64GB, and QR3,999 for the 128GB device (based on availability).



Customers were able to pre-order the devices online via Ooredoo's eShop since

midnight last Friday. The pre-order launch had thousands of people visiting the

company's eShop. Ooredoo said this was the biggest smartphone pre-order launch

the company has seen.



Those who have pre-ordered the phone will receive an SMS and e-mail message,

inviting them to come to a selected Ooredoo branch and collect their device.



Customers unable to purchase a device at the weekend will be able to buy their

selected model on Ooredoo's eShop after the weekend, as the company works to

ensure more stock in the coming weeks.
