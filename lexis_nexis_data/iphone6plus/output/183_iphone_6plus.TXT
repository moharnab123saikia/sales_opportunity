Researchers at gadget repair vendor iFixit has recently drawn attention to a

latent manufacturing defect in Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets which

causes the displays of the handsets to behave in a number of erratic ways like

flickering and becoming unresponsive.



The defect has been dubbed by iFixit as 'Touch Disease.'



Revealing that the 'Touch Disease' latent manufacturing defect causing

display-related issues in iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets can make

"millions" of iPhones potentially vulnerable, iFixit researchers said that the

defect appears to affect iPhone units indiscriminately.



According to the details shared by iFixit researchers, the 'Touch Disease'

defect appears in iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets without any apparent cause

or forewarning, and it mostly manifests itself in the form of visual artifacts

and skewed sensitivity.



As a result of the 'Touch Disease' defect, a thin, gray strip fades in and out,

close to the top-most section of the screens of affected devices. The

problematic strip, which is accompanied by annoying non-responsiveness to touch,

eventually makes the touchscreen completely inoperable.



Explaining the 'Touch Disease' defect in a video, an iFixit spokesman said: "At

first, there may be no defect at all. Later you might notice that the screen is

sometimes unresponsive, but it is quick to come back with a hard reset. As the

crack deepens into a full separation of the chip-board [crack], the periods of

no touch become more frequent."
