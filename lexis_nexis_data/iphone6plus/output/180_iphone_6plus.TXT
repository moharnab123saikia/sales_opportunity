lightweight designs; longer battery life, particularly on the 6 Plus;
split-screen viewing in iPhone 6 Plus; much faster autofocus in camera; faster
processors and wireless radios.     Dislikes: iPhone 6 Plus is too big to hold
easily and comfortably in one average-sized hand; one key new feature - Apple
Pay - won't work until next month; entry level models have too little storage
space.     Specs: 64-bit dual-core processors; 4.7-inch, 1334 x 750 pixel screen
(on the iPhone 6); 5.5-inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel screen on (on the 6 Plus);
1.2-megapixel front and 8-megapixel rear cameras.     Price: For iPhone 6 with a
two-year contract: $200, for 16-gigabyte, $300 for 64-gigabyte and $400 for
128-gigabyte models. For iPhone 6 Plus, $300 for 16-gigabyte, $400 for
