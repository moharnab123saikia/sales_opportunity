ET Review: Apple iPhone 6 & 6 Plus

It's easy to see the iPhone's appeal. Apple was singlehandedly responsible in

shifting the market towards responsive touchscreen phones. They also made app

stores and after market accessories popular, creating multiple new markets along

the way. Each iPhone iteration along the line has seen tremendous success,

despite the odd hiccup or two (remember antenna-gate and the more recent

bendgate)?



First impressions



The iPhone has always stood for three key things: a beautiful design, seamlessly

integrated hardware and software and nearly limitless, highquality apps. Much of

the same tradition is carried forward here.



The phones are completely new from the inside out and both have been designed to

cater to the shift in preference for larger screens. As the quantity of content

we consume has increased, so have screen sizes. The iPhone 4 and 5 series now

look positively tiny in comparison.



At first glance, you'll notice the more rounded edges of the iPhone 6 and 6

Plus. They both have the exact same design but different screen sizes: 4.7-inch

for the 6 and 5.5-inch for the 6 plus. On the face of it, the iPhone 6 seems to

be logical choice for anyone upgrading from an existing iPhone while the 6 Plus

is designed to attract anyone who's already using a phablet sized device.



The screen curves lightly at all four edges - to meet the curve of the sides. On

the iPhone 6, it makes the device feel premium. On the 6 Plus, it just feels

slippery because of the larger dimensions. The 6 Plus also seems to have

unnecessarily large bezels and this makes it larger than other phones with

similar screen sizes.



We feel that the only glaring design flaw is the protruding camera lens at the

back. When placed flat on a surface without a case, the phone will rest on the

lens. It's probably bad for the lens in the long run (despite it being sapphire

glass - you don't a camera lens to be the first thing that makes contact with a

hard surface) and also makes the phone wobble when placed flat. It's almost as

if Apple designed it to be used only with a case.



Hardware



Odd as it may seem - the devices do not have identical specifications. The 6

Plus has a larger battery which is understandable given the larger size. But it

also has a higher resolution display (having the same resolution on both would

have made it easier on developers) and a better camera equipped with optical

image stabilisation.



The rest of the device is all aluminium and the unibody shape now does without

the chamfered edges. Apple never gives out detailed hardware specifications,

insisting that it's the experience that matters more than specs on paper. While

this is true for the most part, this feels like another Apple bastion (after

screen size) that is destined to fall with time. A lot of people buy a device

based solely on specs now.



Both new iPhones have a 1.4Ghz dual core A8 processor and 1GB RAM. This seems

like a far cry from the 2.5Ghz quad/octa core processors and 3GB RAM that many

of the other flagship phones have. To make up for this, the devices have much

more powerful PowerVR quad core graphics. Needless to say, you'll not be wanting

for performance because the combination of iOS 8 and optimised hardware results

in a very zippy device. The phone blazes through all the software benchmarks.

Specifically browser rendering benchmarks and 3D gaming.

Software



Both devices are preloaded with iOS 8, which behaves slightly differently on

both. The first thing you'll notice is that the interface rotates into landscape

view on the 6 Plus. Recognising the larger size of the device/screen, Apple has

also included some tweaks that can help in onehanded use.



For example, Reachability can bring the top part of the screen down if you can't

reach something. Some of the other native apps (Mail, Calendar) have dual pane

views which can make better use of a larger screen. Apart of these things, iOS 8

will look and feel pretty similar if you're already using it on an older device.



Display



The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen (1334 x 750 pixels) while iPhone 6 Plus has a

5.5-inch screen (1920 x 1080 pixels). Apple also says that both phones have

retina-class displays: roughly 326 pixels per inch (ppi) on the iPhone 6 and 401

ppi on the iPhone 6 Plus. Look carefully and you'll still see individual pixels

on the 6. In comparison, Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 has a 5.7-inch display ( 2560 x

1440 pixels; 515 ppi).



Having said all that, both iPhones have a very pleasing display - brilliant,

accurate colours, excellent viewing angles and high levels of contrast. The 6

Plus still has the edge because of the higher resolution.



Camera



Strong camera performance is expected and the new iPhones will not disappoint.

The 6 Plus in particular has optical image stabilisation which compensates

effectively for camera shake. Apart from this, specs are similar: same sensor

size, same resolution (8MP), phase detection autofocus (being used in

smartphones for the second time - first was on Galaxy S5) and dual tone LED

flash. For video, the primary camera is capable of 1080p video at 60fps while

the front camera can do 720p video at 30fps.



The slow motion video is quite enticing - rear cameras on both phones can

capture 720p video at 240 frames per second. Try capturing a fire, falling water

or action sports in this mode.



As expected, daytime photos are stunning from both phones. The 6 Plus has the

obvious edge in low light thanks to OIS. There are very few cameras that can

stand up to the quality that the iPhone 6 Plus offers. Only thing is, we would

have liked to see 4K video recording and more options for exposure adjustment.



Also see



The reduced prices of the iPhone 5S have made it a very enticing buy for anyone

who thought it was too expensive earlier. For the iPhone 6, the obvious

competition would be Samsung's Galaxy Alpha. It's available for Rs 38,900 (only

one version, 32GB without memory expansion) and has the same size screen.



Other flagship 5-inch phones like the HTC One M8, Sony Xperia Z3 and Galaxy S5

also qualify as competition. For the iPhone 6 Plus, we think a worthy competitor

is the Galaxy Note 4. The Note 4 has a better camera overall, a higher

resolution screen, expandable memory, removable battery, a precise

pressure-sensitive stylus and many more features (heart rate monitor, IR

emitter, 4K video recording etc).
