GRIFFITH residents wanting to get their hands on a new iPhone 6 may be waiting a

while.



The large screen versions of the phone arrived at Telstra Business Centre in

Griffith on Friday and were sold out by lunch-time.



Staff member Jackie Hunter said the larger screen seemed to be the main drawcard

in the new phone.



"Most of ours were gone about lunch-time," she said.



Ms Hunter said the store had a long list of names of residents who had expressed

an interest in the latest model.



She said anyone wanting to buy an iPhone 6 "will have to wait".



The release of the highly anticipated large-screen versions of the iPhone made

headlines across Australia, with lines of people wanting to get their hands on

the phone.



The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are the company's first entry into the "phablet"

category.



The iPhone 6 has a screen of 4.7 inches and the 6-Plus will be 5.5 inches,

allowing Apple to adapt to consumers' apparent preference for bigger displays.



Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller said the new iPhones were "simply

stunning" with polarised glass displays and bodies that were "thinner than ever

before".



The iPhone 6 is available in gold, silver or space grey.



Apple's move to larger screens comes as consumers are switching to handsets with

bigger displays to watch videos and browse the internet.
