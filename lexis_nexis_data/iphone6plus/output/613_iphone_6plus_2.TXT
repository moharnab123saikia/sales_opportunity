problems caused by software it released earlier, repeating an apology to owners
of its newest iPhones affected by the bug.

The tech giant had scrambled to fix the software glitch that left some of its
new iPhones unable to make calls, but some analysts say Apple's response to the
high-profile gaffe may be more important than the fault itself.

Some said Apple was doing the right thing by quickly acknowledging and
apologising for the problem - which it was slower to do with earlier iPhone
glitches.

"There's a certain perception that Apple has to get things right and when they
don't, the whole company gets questioned," said Carolina Milanesi, chief of
research at Kantar Worldpanel.

"But they came out and said, 'We apologise; we're working 24/7 to fix it'. I
think that's what matters."

Apple's stock fell nearly 4 per cent yesterday, leading a broader decline in
technology shares, a day after the company was forced to withdraw an update to
its new iOS 8 mobile software because of glitches that primarily affected
customers who had purchased its new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models.

The 6 Plus phone has also been the subject of social media reports that its
extra-large shell is vulnerable to bending.

Apple yesterday defended its manufacturing standards and said bending "is
extremely rare" with normal use of an iPhone. The company said just nine
customers had contacted Apple to report a bent iPhone 6 Plus since they went on
sale.

Hours later Apple released a new update, dubbed iOS 8.0.2, which it said would
fix the problems caused by the iOS 8.0.1 update that it released on Wednesday.

"We apologise for inconveniencing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users who were
impacted by the bug in iOS 8.0.1," the company said.
