 Apple put its latest smartphones, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, on sale in

Turkey and 21 other countries early on Friday morning, including Russia, Saudi

Arabia, Taiwan and European states such as Belgium and the Netherlands.



Customers wanting to be the first to purchase Apple's newest smartphones in

Turkey formed long queues in front of electronic stores on Thursday evening. The

stores let the enthusiastic customers in at the midnight.



"I have been waiting for this for a month. I am very happy to be one of the

first people to buy this phone," said Ataberk Calaz after his early-morning

purchase.



The iPhone 6 16 GB model is on sale in Turkey for TL 2,349 ($1,038); the 64 GB

and 128 GB models are available for purchase at TL 2,649 ($1,170) and TL 2,949

($1,303), respectively.



The larger screen iPhone 6 Plus' 16 GB, 34 GB and 128 GB models cost TL 2,649

($1,170), TL 2,949 ($1,303) and TL 3,249 ($1,435), respectively.



Apple had put the new iPhone models on sale earlier in the United States, UK,

Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico and Singapore. Sales

for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded a record 10 million during the first

weekend the phones were available for purchase.



In addition to Turkey, the new iPhone models were put on sale in Austria,

Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Liechtenstein,

Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Saudi

Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates.



Apple plans to put the new phones on sale in more than 100 countries by the end

of the year.



Apple responded on Thursday to complaints that the iPhone 6 Plus phones "bend,"

saying this is extremely rare during normal use and that it has so far received

only nine such complaints from customers.
