APPLE'S new iPhone models are set to become the fastest-selling smartphones of

all time after the company said it was on track to exceed last year's

recordbreaking opening weekend.



"We are on pace to beat last year's 10m unit first-weekend record when the new

iPhones go on sale [on] September 25," Apple said. "Customer response to iPhone

6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been extremely positive and preorders this weekend

were very strong around the world."



Pre-orders of the next generation of iPhone opened on Saturday after Apple

unveiled the new devices last week, and many models are already sold out in

certain parts of the world, with consumers already facing weeks of delays for

online orders to be dispatched.



Last year's iPhones, the 6 and 6 Plus, became the fastest-selling smartphones of

all time, selling 4m units in their first 24 hours. In the UK, new orders of the

iPhone 6s Plus - the larger of the two models Apple unveiled last week - are not

expected to be released for up to four weeks. In China, the world's biggest

smartphone market and a key target for Apple, all models of the new handset face

a backlog of at least two weeks. This is the first time Apple is taking

pre-orders in China at the same time as the rest of its major markets.



Shares opened 2.3pc higher on Monday in response to the positive news.



The smaller model, the iPhone 6s, is still listed as being available from

September 25, the official date that the new iPhones go on sale. That is except

for the new "rose gold" model, new orders of which will be dispatched in up to

three weeks. Apple introduced the pink-ish hue for the first time this year, in

what is seen as an attempt to appeal to customers in China.



"While there are still unknowns about inventory levels, we note that China

demand in particular looks very strong out of the gates and is a positive sign

that the white-hot momentum out of this region shows no signs of abating despite

macro headwinds out of China," said Daniel Ives, technology specialist at US

investment bank FBR Capital.



Apple is launching iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in 12 countries this year. That is

bigger than the iPhone 6 launch, which debuted in nine countries and did not

include China.
