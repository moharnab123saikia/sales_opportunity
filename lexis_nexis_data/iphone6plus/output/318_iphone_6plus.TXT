LENGTH: 219  words





Apple might have tried its best to be discreet about the hardware components

used in its recently launched Iphone 6 Plus, however it could not keep it under

covers for long. Gadget repair firm iFixit got a unit of Iphone 6 Plus in

Australia and tore it down to reveal what sits inside the biggest-ever iPhone.

The tear down shows that the iPhone 6 Plus includes chips from Qualcomm,

Skyworks Solutions and Avago Technologies, comes with 1GB of RAM instead of the

rumored 2GB RAM, and houses a high capacity 2,915mAh battery.



The teardown shows that Apple has made noticeable bumps in the battery size by

upping it to a massive 2915 mAh battery, from 1560 mAh battery on iPhone 5S. It

also shows that the iPhone 6 Plus runs on Qualcomm 4G LTE chipset which is

responsible for offering connectivity to 20 LTE bands.



To ensure smooth and faster operations, it houses M8 motion coprocessor (NXP

LPC18B1UK), Qualcomm WTR1625L RF transceiver chip, NXP 65V10 NSD425 NFC chip,

Skyworks, Avago, Murata339S0228 Wi-Fi Module, Broadcom BCM5976 touchscreen

controller, TriQuint power amplifier module and InvenSense's gyroscope and

accelerometer. Also, the phone comes with SK Hynix's NAND flash memory chip for

inbuilt storage. However what might disappoint some fans expecting better RAM is

the 1GB of RAM provided in iPhone 6 Plus.
