LENGTH: 495  words





In order to get their hands on the new iPhones before others, many of Apple-fans

even queued up in front of the Apple stores one day before the sales began.



With Apple's iPhone 6 and Plus launching in around nine countries and regions

across the world on Sept 19, the new large-screen gadgets attracted huge crowds

of fans to retail outlets.



In order to get their hands on the new iPhones before others, many of them even

queued up in front of the Apple stores one day before the sales began. Buyers

from Chinese mainland, where the sought-after gadgets have not yet been

launched, went to other countries just to be among the first to buy the new

iPhones.
