Muscat: Telecom majors in Oman are all set to offer the much-in-demand iPhone 6

and 6 Plus from Apple.





Omantel announced that it would offer iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the biggest

advancements in iPhone history beginning from November 13. Customers may get

more information at www.omantel.om.



Ooredoo also announced that it would offer the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus from

November 13.

"Customers can pre-order the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus from Friday November 7

at www.ooredoo.om/iphone6," said a release.



Even though, iPhone's 6 series models are still not being sold by Apple's

authorised stores in Oman, they are available in local shops which have

purchased them from United Arab Emirates and other countries.

In local stores, the iPhone 6 16GB costs OMR325, 64GB will cost OMR410 and 128GB

will cost OMR430. The iPhone 6 Plus 16GB will cost OMR350 and 64GB will cost

OMR440.



Price range

In September, Apple's online store crashed under the weight of demand from eager

customers hoping to pre-order one of the new iPhone 6 models during its launch.



According to Apple's official website, the price of iPhone 6 16GB is $199, while

the iPhone 6 Plus 16GB will be $299 with a two-year contract for US customers.
