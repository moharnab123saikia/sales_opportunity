How much is the new iPhone 7 and will the iPhone 6s price drop after Apple

launch?;

If rumours are true, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus UK price shouldn't differ

too much from previous Apple smartphone releases

Apple is gearing up to launch its next-generation iPhone at an event in

California later today.



If the online rumour mill is anything to go by, this year it will almost

certainly be the iPhone 7 that's revealed.



There should be two iPhone 7 models announced at the launch event later today -

the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus - and as with the iPhone 6 and 6S, they'll both

come with different storage options.

But how much will the iPhone 7 set you back?



First off, there's talk that Apple will kill of the 16GB model, meaning the

price of the cheapest (32GB) SIM free iPhone 7 could be slightly more expensive

than the iPhone 6S when it launched last year - what with it being double the

capacity of last year's iPhone 6S entry model.

rumours about Apple's new iPhone



If Apple sticks to its normal pattern, the iPhone 7 will start at £539 in the UK

- that's the same price as the 32GB iPhone 6s



From there, the next two internal storage sizes will increase the iPhone 7

price: 64GB should be £619, while the 128GB would be £699.

As well as slashing the 16GB model this year, Apple is expected to introduce a

new 256GB model for the first time.



It's likely Apple will decide to charge a premium for this new configuration. If

it follows the same pattern in pricing, this could set you back a whopping £779.



Rumours also suggest that if we see a 256GB model, Apple will not bother with a

64GB model, offering just three storage options - 32GB, 128GB or 256GB.



The larger iPhone 7 Plus will be even more of a wallet buster than it's smaller

sibling.



If rumours are true, the cheapest (32GB) iPhone 7 Plus will likely cost around

£679, followed by a 128GB model at £769, and then a 256GB variant costing an

astonishing £879.

The good news for those not wanting to splash out hundreds for a brand new

smartphone is that Apple is likely to slash the price of its iPhone 6S models

after the launch of the iPhone 7.



Traditionally, Apple has taken around £100 off its previous generation

smartphones, so it's very possible that the iPhone 6s will be available from

around £450, with the iPhone 6 being discontinued.



Also note that all the UK networks will be offering contract deals shortly after

the iPhone 7 announcement, so keep your eyes peeled for that.
