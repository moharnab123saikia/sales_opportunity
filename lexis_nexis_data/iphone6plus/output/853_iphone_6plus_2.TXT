the stock up 1 percent in a down market.

"Customer response to iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been extremely positive,
and pre-orders this weekend were very strong around the world," Apple said. "We
are on pace to beat last year's 10-million-unit first-weekend record when the
new iPhones go on sale Sept. 25."

Apple, which started taking pre-orders for the two new models on Saturday, said
online demand for the iPhone 6s Plus in particular "has been exceptionally
strong and exceeded our own forecasts for the pre-order period."

The new models - unveiled last Wednesday - aren't dramatically different from
the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus that came out a year ago.

But they do offer advances in video, photography and navigation through a "peek
and pop" feature that allows users to preview content by pressing the phone's
screen lightly and to call up content by applying a heavier touch.

BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk predicted the inclusion of China in this year's
first-weekend rollout would greatly boost sales by "more than doubling the
addressable market for launch day compared to last year."

China didn't receive last year's models until mid-October, the analyst said.
