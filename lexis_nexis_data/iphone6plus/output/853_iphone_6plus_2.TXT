Apple saw record first-weekend pre-sales for its new iPhones on Monday, driving

the stock up 1 percent in a down market.



"Customer response to iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been extremely positive,

and pre-orders this weekend were very strong around the world," Apple said. "We

are on pace to beat last year's 10-million-unit first-weekend record when the

new iPhones go on sale Sept. 25."



Apple, which started taking pre-orders for the two new models on Saturday, said

online demand for the iPhone 6s Plus in particular "has been exceptionally

strong and exceeded our own forecasts for the pre-order period."



The new models - unveiled last Wednesday - aren't dramatically different from

the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus that came out a year ago.



But they do offer advances in video, photography and navigation through a "peek

and pop" feature that allows users to preview content by pressing the phone's

screen lightly and to call up content by applying a heavier touch.



BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk predicted the inclusion of China in this year's

first-weekend rollout would greatly boost sales by "more than doubling the

addressable market for launch day compared to last year."



China didn't receive last year's models until mid-October, the analyst said.
