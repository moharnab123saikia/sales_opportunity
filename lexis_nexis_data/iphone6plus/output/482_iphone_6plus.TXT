LENGTH: 264  words





Apple has announced that its new generation Iphone 6 and Iphone 6 Plus have out

passed a whopping four million pre-orders in first 24 hours after the phones

went up on pre-orders. These new phones have broken all the previous pre-order

records set by iPhone.



Tim Cook, Apple's CEO has said that "Pre-orders for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus

set a new record for Apple, and we can't wait to get our best iPhones yet into

the hands of customers starting this Friday."



The company mentions that though it will start delivering a significant amount

of phones beginning this Friday (September 19) and will continue doing so

throughout September, some iPhone pre-orders will be delivered in October.



Consumers will also be able to buy iPhones on apple retail store from September

19, though people might not receive the units immediately as the delivery of

these will depend on stock available at the time of purchase.



iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be available in the US, Australia, Canada,

France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK beginning

this Friday, September 19. In addition to that, the company has also mentioned

the name of those 20 countries in which the sale for new iPhones will begin on

September 26. These countries include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,

Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New

Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden,

Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and United Arab Emirates. This further kills even

the slightest of hope around Apple iPhone 6's India launch in September.
