Getting the new iPhone is one thing, getting it dressed up is another. Recently

my email box has been flooded with new cases to dress up your naked iPhone 6 or

6 Plus, and here are some highlights.



? The PowerArmour from BuQu Tech has a 2,500mAh battery in a uni-body shell

exterior to protect the iPhone 6 from drops.



BuQu states that the internal battery doesn't add any unnecessary bulk to the

smartphone, slides in and out of the case with its patented slide-lock

mechanism.



There's also a built-in LED gauge showing available battery power and a

power-saving on/off switch.



www.buqutech.com, $79.99, expected out in November



? One of my favorites, the Q Card Case from CM4, is now available for the iPhone



6. The Q Card Case's one-piece design combines a wallet on the back side of the

protective case.



A few credit cards, ID and cash can be stored in the wallet, which is built into

the case constructed of a patented soft-touch rubber and premium fabric design.



www.CM4.com, $39.99, available in black onyx, pacific green and champagne gold



? New Trent has announced the Trentium and Alixo cases, a new line of protective

cases for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.



The Trentium has an ultra-thin and rugged design, making it dirt- and

water-resistant for both new phones in black, gold or silver. The Alixo has the

same protection as the Trentium but adds a scratch-resistant screen case, along

with an interchangeable front cover in choices of black or white.



www.newtrent.com, $31.95 each, the cases will be available October 31



?ENERGI's sliding power case for iPhone 6 ($99.99) has a built-in 3,200mAh

rechargeable and battery. Once it's taken off you'll have a protective TPUlined

inner case for enhanced drop protection.



The ALIN glass screen protector ($34.99) keeps your new iPhone 6 clean and

scratch-free. It attaches with the included snap-on alignment tool for easy

positioning to make the installation simple.

? X-Doria's fashion-forward accessories now include a full line of iPhone 6 and

6 Plus cases including the Defense 720? and the Engage Folio.



The Defense 720? ($29.99) features a full-screen, hard-plastic protective front

shield, which completely covers the screen but still allows full control of the

touchscreen.



Rear armor is built into the back for a grippy, protective bumper with a sturdy

shield. The two-piece construction snaps together with each for full protection

and is available in black, blue and pink for the iPhone 6.



The Engage Folio is a clear, hard polycarbonate back to protect the smartphone

without hiding it and an anti-scratch coating helps keep the view crystal clear.



A leather-like front cover protects the screen and has card slots on the inside

to store credit cards or a license. The Engage Folio is available for both the

iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus for $29.99.



? Urban Armor Gear's collection of protective solutions for the new 4.7- and

5.5-inch iPhone 6 meet military standards for drop and shock (MIL-STD

810G-516.6).



They are constructed with a hard armor shell, soft rubber core and bumpers in a

rugged one-piece design.



Urban Armor Gear iPhone 6 cases are available for pre-order in black, white,

rust (orange), plasma (pink), slate (blue) and ice (clear) for $34.95 each for

the 4.7-inch device and $39.95 for the 5.5-inch device.
