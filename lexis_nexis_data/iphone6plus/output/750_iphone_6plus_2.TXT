Apple suffers a nasty case of the bends on new iPhone

Apple fans have leapt to the defence of their gadgets in the wake of reports

that a new iPhone suffers from a serious design flaw that means it bends under

the strain of being carried in users' pockets. Websites that review Apple

products have been quick to post images of competitors' phones showing that they

also suffer warping, while users have dismissed the critics as "conspiracists".



According to one site, Cult of Mac, the fact that the iPhone 6 Plus, the larger

of the two new models, bends when the frame is put under strain is nothing new:

"Some are deeming the new iPhones 'more fragile than expected', but the truth is

we've seen this problem almost every year," it reported last week. It posted

pictures of phones from rival brands, including the Sony Xperia Z1, the Nokia

Lumia 925 and the Samsung Galaxy S4, all apparently bent.



The claims have led to an online "bend-off" between rival camps. Unbox Therapy

posted a video of the iPhone 6 Plus being bent, then compared it with a Galaxy

Note 3 being put under the same pressure without similar warping.



Others questioned whether photos of the iPhone being circulated online were

genuine, or if they were really the result of everyday use - rather than a

concerted effort to bend the phone. One site suggested hipsters in tight

trousers were the problem. It put the phone through a "skinny jeans" test to see

if it would bend under the strain of being wedged in a tight pocket as well as

subjecting it to a 10-squat test. None of these situations managed to bend the

phone, it reported.



Apple has so far limited its response to criticism of the phone, saying it had

received nine complaints in the first six days. "With normal use a bend in

iPhone is extremely rare," the company said.



Bendgate, as the affair has inevitably been dubbed, has threatened to take the

shine off Apple's multimillion-pound launch of two new handsets - the iPhone 6

and 6 Plus. Both were hailed as triumphs when they were unveiled this month at

its HQ in Cupertino, California. Early reviews were overwhelmingly positive:

Stephen Fry, the writer and Apple aficionado, declared that the new phone was a

triumph : "I believe them to be the best and most beautiful mobile telecom

technology ever yet produced. So sue me if I'm proved wrong."



It follows a potentially more serious software fault experienced by some iPhone

users last week. Apple was forced to withdraw an update to its new operating

system, iOS 8, after it cut off the mobile network connection - in effect

turning the handset into a glorified iPod Touch. The error occurred on Wednesday

morning, when Apple released an update intended to address bugs in the first

release of iOS 8, installed on both new models and available free for most older

Apple devices. It withdrew the update after a few hours as error reports came in

and has released a software patch that should fix any crippled handset.



The two problems resulted in Â£12bn being wiped off the value of the company's

shares and drew criticism of Tim Cook's stewardship of Apple, with pundits

saying this wouldn't have happened during the reign of the late Steve Jobs. But

Jobs presided over an iPhone furore of his own in 2010, dubbed Antennagate, when

the radio receivers built into early models of the iPhone 4 could result in the

loss of mobile reception should the phone be gripped in a certain way. Jobs

famously told users they were holding it in the wrong way- but the company later

changed the antenna design and offered free cases that corrected the fault.



Hardware gripes and software glitches are by no means unique to Apple, of

course, but these are unusual missteps by a company that has grown to be one of

the most profitable in the world by offering a level of service and design

perceived to be a cut above that of its rivals. It has led to pundits claiming

we have passed "peak Apple" - the time when the company was at its zenith.

Punters, though, appear not to have read these reports. Even as Apple's troubles

piled up, it sold an estimated 3m iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets, on top of the

record 10m sales in its first weekend.

Settings app, opening the General sub-menu and tapping Software Update
