Sept. 9 -- Every moment can be recorded, snapped and saved for a rainy day with

the new, enhanced iSight camera in iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. OtterBox

continues to protect the memories that matter most. From the No. 1-most trusted

case brand in smartphone protection, OtterBox announces a full lineup of cases

available now for the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.1



Defender Series, Commuter Series, Symmetry Series and Strada Series are

available now for iPhone 6s with Alpha Glass coming soon.2 iPhone 6s Plus cases

available now include Defender Series, Commuter Series and Symmetry Series, with

Alpha Glass coming soon.



"OtterBox tests each case design for more than 238 hours so you know your

memories are safe from the drops and bumps in daily life," said OtterBox

President and CEO Pete Lindgren. "iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are designed to

seamlessly integrate into your day, and our cases are the same - built for you

and your lifestyle. So you can take your brand new iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus

and hand it to a toddler or go out 4-wheeling, without pause and without worry."



Each case design for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus undergoes a minimum of 24

tests across more than 238 hours to earn the seal of OtterBox Certified Drop+

Protection. These tests ensure lasting protection from drops, bumps, scratches

and dings. Trusted protection - tailored to every lifestyle - is available today

for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, and are compatible with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

Plus devices.



Defender Series' triple-layer protection is the original case design that Apple

lovers have trusted with their precious devices for nearly a decade. The

built-in screen protector blocks out scratches and dust, while the shell and

outer slipcover absorb and dissipate shock. Custom color combinations for

Defender Series are available now for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus on

otterbox.com.



The sleek Symmetry Series slides easily into pockets and slips perfectly in and

out of purses to help quickly capture Live Photos or 4K video. This slim iPhone

6s and iPhone 6s Plus case is simple to install, and a raised, beveled edge

provides extra protection for the touchscreen during facedown drops. The

Symmetry Series case design is tested in-house to stand up to the wear and tear

with a purse test - fending off scratches from keys, shades and wallets for

long-lasting graphics and vibrant colors.



Two form-fitting layers combine to create the thin, protective Commuter Series

for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The outer shell and inner slipcover combine to

pull shock away from the device, and port covers keep debris out of the charge

and headphone connectors. Customize Commuter Series by creating a color

combination on otterbox.com.



For a classic, tailored look, Strada Series slips iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus

into genuine leather and trusted protection. The folio front clasps open or

closed to guard against touchscreen scratches and includes a card slot to hold a

credit or identification card. A slim audio vent in the folio makes it simple to

take calls with the cover closed. Strada Series for iPhone 6s Plus is the first

time this professional, polished protection is available for a super-sized

smartphone.



OtterBox cases for iPad Pro and iPad mini 4 are being evaluated and information

on product availability will be released later this year.



OtterBox iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus cases are available now on otterbox.com

and at select retailers. For more information, visit otterbox.com.
