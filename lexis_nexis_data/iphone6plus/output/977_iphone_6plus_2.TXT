

Just three days after launching a crowd-funding campaign, Lunatik has raised
more than $125,000, well above its original goal of $100,000, for two iPhone 6
cases well-suited to the outdoor adventurer: they feature an airtight
compression closure system that protect from water and dust.

They also offer impact protection that the company claims exceeds military
standards, referencing the MIL-STD-810G test used by the United States Military
to classify protective equipment.

When all ports are closed, the iPhone 6 will be submergible for up to an hour in
water that's two meters deep.

This case is said to be indestructible and its screen features an extra
protective layer called the Corning Gorilla Glass, which does not compromise the
touch-screen system of the iPhone 6. It comes with a separate locking key and
audio extender for attaching headphones.

Ultra form-fitting to the iPhone 6, this is Lunatik's slimmest iPhone protective
case yet, according to the company. That being said, they even found room to
attach a non-slip impact bumper and its photo lens allows for crisp, clear
pictures.

The company is also creating a version of each case for the iPhone 6 plus,
although they will not be part of the campaign in question. To be notified upon
release: www.lunatik.com/products/iphone-6-plus/taktik-360?variant=black

The TAKTIK 360 for iPhone 6 can be pre-ordered for $99, and the AQUATIK for
iPhone 6 for $79 with delivery expected in March 2015. Orders outside the US
cost $20 extra for shipping and handling.
