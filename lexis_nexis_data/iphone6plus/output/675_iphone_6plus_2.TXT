After two weeks of breathlessly covering Applecs new gadgets, we thought wecd

scrutinized the iPhone 6 Plus from every angle. But we didnct think to ask

whether it would be compatible with skinny jeans.



Over the past few days, several users have come forward claiming that their

coveted 6 Plus has started to bend. Most of the incidents arose after users sat

for an extended period of time with the phones in their pockets. People who wear

tight pants appear to be most at risk.



At first, the phenomenon was documented largely throughcTwitter posts topped off

with the hashtag c#bendgate.c But yesterday, Lewis Hilsenteger of Unbox Therapy,

an online technology show, put the rumors to the test. In the video ,

Hilsenteger demonstrates how his new 6 Plus warps under pressure from his

fingers.



cThis was painful to do,c he said. cMaybe this is enough information to push you

in the direction of buying the [iPhone 6]cover the 6 Plus.c



The iPhone 6 Plus, Applecs first cphablet,c vanished almost immediately after it

debuted in stores on Friday, forcing some who had spent hours in line waiting to

leave empty-handed. cThe phone, which measures 5.5 inches diagonally, has been

hailed for its light and thin feel, due in part to its aluminum shell. The

material is also famous for its malleability   we wrap leftovers in aluminum

foil, after all   so perhaps Apple should have braced itself for a more flexible

phone.



Still, some were puzzled that such a gaffe could slip past the valleycs

consummate perfectionist.



cIcm really surprised that this didnct show up at Apple before when they did

testing,c analyst Eric Virey of Yole Developpement, a French research firm, told

SiliconBeat.



But as Tech Crunch pointed out , finding flaw in Applecs latest gadget has

become a favorite fall pastime in the Valley. The tech news sitecalso noted that

reports of bending surfaced with the iPhone 5s and 5c.



A spokeswoman for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.



Wecve put out calls to a few material sciences professors to hear their thoughts

on this phenomenon. Wecll report back as they respond.



Applecs new iPhone 6 Plus may bend under pressure, according to early reports

from users (Getty Images).c
