TECHNOLOGY ADVANCE orders for the -latest iPhone have been so strong that

technology giant Apple expects to surpass last year's record, when it sold 10

million phones in the first weekend of sales.



Apple began taking pre--orders for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus on Saturday.

The new models, which go on sale on September 25, have more memory and faster

pro-cessors, along with a new 12-megapixel camera. The phones have not gone up

in price, but last year's -record-selling iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models will sell

for $140 less.



"As many customers noticed, the online demand for iPhone 6s Plus has been

exceptionally strong and exceeded our own forecasts for the pre-order period,"

Apple said.



"We are working to catch up as quickly as we can, and we will have iPhone 6s

Plus as well as iPhone 6s units available at Apple retail stores when they open

next Friday."The iPhone is still Apple's most important product, making up

two-thirds of the company's sales.
