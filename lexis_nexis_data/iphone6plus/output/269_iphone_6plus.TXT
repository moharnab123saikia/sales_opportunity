CUPERTINO, Calif. | Apple CEO Tim Cook debuted Apple's first new product

category Tuesday since the introduction of the iPad tablet computer, showing off

a new smartwatch along with two iPhones and a mobile-payments offering built in

to the new devices.



Apple's smartwatch - called simply the Apple Watch - has a new user interface,

with Cook declaring, "What we didn't do was take the iPhone and shrink the user

interface and strap it on your wrist."



It will come in three different basic forms: Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and

Apple Edition, with the last one available in 18-karat gold; Apple Watch will be

a standard offering, while the Sport edition will be sturdier. The wearable

computer will be highly customizable, with different sizes for the watch face

and bands of different colors as well as leather and metal, with a starting base

price of $350. The device will go on sale in early 2015.



Users will interact with the Apple Watch through a dial on the side, using it to

scroll up and down and zoom in, or through its touchscreen, which is made of

synthetic sapphire Apple has been manufacturing in Arizona.



The device will have access to Apple's voice-detection technology Siri, allowing

users to guide through interactions with voice commands, and a series of

gestures can help control basic functions as well.



The watch - which must be used in tandem with an  iPhone 5 or later - can record

users' vitals, with sensors detecting bodily actions such as pulse rate, and

record them with HealthKit, Apple software introduced earlier this year at the

Worldwide Developers Conference. More functionality will quickly be on the way:

Outside developers received access to build apps for the watch through new

software called WatchKit.



With its customizable form and different possible tasks, the Apple Watch can be

a different device for different users' needs, Cook said, calling it "the most

personal device Apple has ever created."



"I use mine to control the Apple TV, another team member uses his as a remote

for his iPhone camera," the CEO divulged.



Apple introduced two new iPhones that will function with its smartwatch - a

larger iPhone than before, the iPhone 6 Plus, along with the iPhone 6, which

Cook described as "the best phones you have ever seen." The  iPhone 6 Plus will

be 5.5 inches diagonal, a size in between a smartphone and tablet that has

proved especially popular in Asia.



One of the iPhone 6 smartphones' big advances is  Apple Pay, a mobile-payments

offering that utilizes near-field communications to get rid of credit cards'

"outdated and vulnerable magnetic stripe," as Cook described them.



Instead of using physical cards, Apple's iPhone will connect to users' payment

options, while not storing credit card numbers or security codes.



Apple software leader Eddy Cue stressed the security and privacy of Apple's

payments option, which will link with American Express, Visa and Mastercard.



"Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it, or how much you paid

for it," Cue said.



The service will work with 220,000 contactless machines in place at retailers,

along with Apple partners such as McDonald's, Walgreens and Disney.



The iPhone 6 screen will measure 4.7 inches diagonally, the same as the iPhone

5S, but the iPhone 6 Plus will have a 5.5-inch screen, with both receiving

Apple's "Retina" high-resolution display. The larger form factor will give the

iPhone 6 Plus a larger battery and therefore longer battery life: Apple said

that the iPhone 6 will have about 14 hours of talk time, in line with the

previous iteration, while the iPhone 6 Plus will have 24 hours of talk time.



Both phones will be offered in black, gray and gold. The smaller iPhone 6 will

have a price tag starting at $199 with subsidies from wireless carriers, ranging

up to $399 for a phone with 128 GB of memory; the iPhone 6 Plus will range from

$299 to $499 with a two-year contract. Apple will begin selling the phones on

Sept. 19 in the United States and eight other countries, and wants to roll out

sales to more than 100 countries by the end of the year.
