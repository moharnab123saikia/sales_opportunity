Starting March 17, KeyBank customers will be able to use Apple Pay[TM] to make

simple and secure payments at more than 700,000 businesses across the United

States and select iOS[TM] apps. "We're thrilled to add Apple Pay to the

fast-growing range of digital banking services we offer banking customers," said

Matthew D. Lehman, senior vice president and head of digital banking. Using

their iPhone® 6 or iPhone® 6 Plus mobile devices running iOS 8.1 or later,

KeyBank customers can use Apple Pay[TM], a mobile payments solution, to

complete credit or debit card transactions without revealing their card

information. Completing a transaction is easy; customers simply hold their

iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus near a contactless reader with their finger on the

Touch ID[TM] fingerprint sensor. KeyBank customers can also make in-app

purchases with either the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air® 2 or iPad mini® 3

mobile devices. Visit Key.com for more information about KeyBank's commitment to

offering secure, easy-to-use digital banking services.
