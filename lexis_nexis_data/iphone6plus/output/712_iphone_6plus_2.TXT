Apple has unveiled new iPhones, an updated version of its Apple TV, which now

has its own app store and a voice-controlled remote control, as well as a

12.9-inch iPad Pro at a media event in San Francisco.



The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be arriving in Australia on September 25.



Here are six things they have that your iPhone 6 does not:



The iPhones now come in rose gold.



Maybe you never cared for the garish yellow gold Apple released to appeal to the

Chinese market. Maybe you want your phone to match your crazy expensive rose

gold Apple Watch (or the just-announced rose-gold-coloured aluminum Apple Watch

Sport you plan to buy). Whatever your rationale, if you wanted another option

besides gray, silver and yellow gold, you got it.



As predicted, Apple has renamed Force Touch as 3D Touch and implemented it in

its new iPhones. The name reflects the fact that there are three levels of

pressure you can now apply to the screen for different results.



Regular tapping works as it always has. Press lightly ' on a photo, email or web

page for instance ' and you'll get a preview of the content without having to

leave the screen you're currently on. Pressing more firmly will allow additional

options, for example opening your camera app directly into selfie mode.



The main camera on the 6s and 6s Plus has been improved over last year's phones.

The new camera is 12MP (compared to 8MP on the iPhone 6) and features a custom

Apple-made signal processor the company says will produce more accurate colour

than past models.



The front selfie camera is now 5MP (up from 1.2MP). Curiously, rather than add

an unsightly flash to the front of the device, the phone's display will flash

white at max brightness to illuminate your subject when you take a picture.

Apple calls this 'Retina Flash', which one hopes is not a commentary on the

effect it will have on your ocular tissue.



There's also a new software innovation Apple is calling Live Photos, which

records the moments before and after you take a picture to allow for more

animated shots.



In addition to 3D Touch and the new camera, a lot of subtle tweaks have been

made to the way the iPhone is put together.



New, stronger aluminum and glass makes the device stronger than its predecessors

(and presumably less likely to bend).



An all new 64-bit A9 processor, with an embedded M9 motion co-processor, will

not only let the phones crunch data and apps harder and faster but will also let

them run low power services for much longer.



Connectivity has also been bumped up to bring iPhone in line with its more

cutting edge competitors. The change means faster internet speeds on next-gen

mobile networks like Telstra's 4GX, as well as better 4G mobile reception while

roaming internationally.



This one is a bit of a cheat, as iOS 9 will also be coming to older iPhones as

well as iPads and the iPod Touch, but it is launching with the 6s and 6s Plus.



A big bump in efficiency in iOS 9 promises longer battery life, which should be

especially noticeable with the improved processing on the 6s and 6s Plus.



On iPhone the operating system also has a new Android-like app switcher for

better multitasking, an improved keyboard and some handy tweaks to built-in

software like Notes and Maps.



Wow, the Australian dollar's position versus the US has not done good things for

the price of iPhones. The cheapest version of the iPhone 6s, which has a meagre

16GB of storage, will be $1079 in Australia.



Those with good memories may already know this is $210 more than the launch

price of the comparable iPhone 6 model that launched this time last year

(although Apple did sneakily raise that price in March).



The gap grows wider the more storage you want, and wider still for the 6s Plus.

If you want the bigger phone with 128GB of storage, you'll pay $1529, $280 more

than the launch price of the comparable iPhone 6 Plus from last year.



If you want a phone outright for less than $1000, it will not be a new iPhone.
