LENGTH: 162  words





The top-end variant to cost Rs 92,000.



Keep your expensive iPhone jokes handy as Apple has just unveiled the pricing

details of its latest handsets. The best thing is that the information comes

directly from Apple's official website in India. Apple has also confirmed that

the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be launching in India on October 7. Earlier

today, Apple slashed the the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus prices to make way for

the waterproof iPhone duo.



The iPhone 7 Plus that boasts of a dual camera setup will be available in jet

black, black, silver, gold, and rose gold (pink). Its pricing details are as

follows:



iPhone 7 Plus 32 GB - 72,000



iPhone 7 Plus 128 GB - 82,000



iPhone 7 Plus 256 GB - 92,000 (insert your kidney joke here)



The compact iPhone 7 with a 4.7-inch display comes in same hues as that of its

sibling. Due to the lack of fancy dual-camera setup, the iPhone 7 costs

relatively lesser:



iPhone 7 32 GB - 60,000



iPhone 7 128 GB - 70,000



iPhone 7 256 GB - 80,000
