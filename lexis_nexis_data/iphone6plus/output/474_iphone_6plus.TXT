percentage' of devices are affected

If you've had a run of blurry photos taken with an iPhone 6 Plus smartphone, the

problem may not be your photographic skills.



Apple has launched a camera replacement programme for the device after a number

of owners complained about the quality of photos taken using its iSight camera.



"Apple has determined that, in a small percentage of iPhone 6 Plus devices, the

iSight camera has a component that may fail causing your photos to look blurry,"

explained the company.



"The affected units fall into a limited serial number range and were sold

primarily between September 2014 and January 2015."



Owners are being asked to check the serial number of their device on Apple's

website, before making an appointment to have the camera replaced at one of the

company's stores or authorised service providers.



Affected owners are being warned that if their iPhone 6 Plus has any other

damage - a cracked screen, for example - they will have to get that repaired

first, possibly paying for it.

Apple is replacing the iSight cameras in this case, rather than recalling the

smartphones, as it did in October 2013 with a limited number of iPhone 5s

handsets after a manufacturing error made them drain their batteries faster than

expected.



The first complaints about blurry photos on the iPhone 6 Plus were reported on

Apple's support website in October 2014, just weeks after the device went on

sale.



Although several users on the support thread reported that their handsets had

been replaced when they took them in to Apple Stores for diagnosis, it has taken

until now for the company to publicly confirm the issue, and launch an official

replacement programme for the affected cameras.



Apple is expected to unveil new iPhone models in September, including an iPhone

6s and 6s Plus.
