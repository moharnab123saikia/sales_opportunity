LENGTH: 341  words





One of the most hotly anticipated launches of the year - that of Apple's iPhone

6 and iPhone 6 Plus - is just around the corner. Vodafone today announced that

it will be offering both these products in store from Friday 24 October.



The iPhone 6 is the new version of iPhone that Apple is describing as being not

only bigger but "simply better in any way" than anything that has come before.

According to Apple, the iPhone 6 represents the perfect fusion of design and

function with "one continuous form where hardware and software function in

perfect unison, creating a new generation of iPhone that's better by any

measure."



Given the iconic status of the iPhone it is not surprising that interest has

been very strong in Malta, with Apple fans waiting eagerly to get their hands on

the iPhone 6 as soon as possible.



"Interest was evident quite a while back when the iPhone 6 was launched in other

countries, with Vodafone customers asking about its availability in our retail

outlets and call centre for the past weeks," said Luan Vella, Terminals Senior

Executive from Vodafone Malta. "As Vodafone Malta we are proud to be the only

Apple authorized reseller of iPhones offering a 2 year warranty on the phones in

Malta. This helps us provide our customers the latest technology accompanied by

the best service and offers on the Maltese Islands." He added that "With our

high speed and reliable network and our great value plans, Vodafone customers

can be assured of a great experience at great value."



Apple's iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus  are being launched for all Vodafone

customers in three different colours: grey, gold and silver



Vodafone customers can beat the queue by pre-registering their iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus from Friday 17 October at www.vodafone.com .mt. For more

information, visit one of Vodafone's retail outlets across Malta and Gozo, call

247 from a Vodafone line or 9999 9247 from any other line, or visit or log onto

Vodafone Malta's Facebook Page. For more information on the iPhone 6, please
