NEW DELHI: About a week post the union budget, Apple has increased prices of all

its smartphones in India by up to Rs 2,500. Following the increase, iPhone 5S

will now start at Rs 47,000, iPhone 6 at Rs 56,000 and iPhone 6 Plus at Rs

65,000.



The development was first reported by Fonearena. TOI Tech has independently

verified the hike through Apple's retail channel partners who confirmed it.

However, an Apple spokesperson refused to confirm the move.



The hike comes after the Indian government proposed an increase in excise duty

on mobile phones imported into India to 12.5% from existing 6%, as part of its

attempts to push local manufacturing, in the union budget.



The 32GB variant of iPhone 5S will now be available at Rs 51,500(old price - Rs

49500). iPhone 6 16GB gets a Rs 2,500 hike while its 64GB will now cost Rs 65000

(old price - Rs 62,500) and the 128GB version will set you back by Rs 74,000(old

price - Rs 71,500).



The iPhone 6 Plus will now cost Rs 65,000 for 16GB, Rs 74,000 for 64GB and Rs

83,000 for 128GB models, a hike of Rs 2,500.



iPhone 6, Apple's first big-screen smartphone, sports a 4.7-inch HD (1334x750p)

display and is powered by A8 processor and 1GB RAM. The smartphone runs on iOS 8

and has an 8MP iSight camera that features phase detection and can take 43MP

panorama photos.



iPhone 6 Plus, the company's first phablet, has a 5.5-inch (1920x1080p) display,

and like iPhone 6 is powered by A8 processor and 1GB RAM and runs on iOS 8. It

also features an 8MP camera with optical image stabilization and packs a

2,915mAh battery.



iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are the thinnest smartphones Apple has made yet.
