The iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus have only been available a few week but users

of the two new iPhones have reported a rather astonishing structural flaw: The

smartphones bend.



Camping overnight outside Apple stores to spend money on a redundant smartphone

is just plain foolish in my opinion but even more astonishing is the fact that

Apple has somehow unintentionally created a flexible phone. iPhone users have

taken to the MacUsers Forum in droves to report the flaw, with many uploading

images of their bent iPhones. One user even claimed that his iPhone was

distorted after a mere 18 hours in his pocket. Clearly even he realised the

fruitlessness of owning an iPhone 6.



But is this all an elaborate hoax?



Unbox Therapy's Lewis Hilsenteger, a YouTuber who also happens to be a dedicated

iPhone 6 Plus owner, released a video of a brand new iPhone 6 Plus undergoing a

bend test; he bent it with his own hands, dispelling hopes that #bendgate is a

mere hoax. Needless to say it failed the test rather miserably. In a follow up

video where he conducted the same test on a Galaxy Note 3, he attempted to

revert the iPhone 6 Plus back to its original shape, however the screen cracked.



Notably, these aren't the first iPhones to warp out of shape. A few weeks after

its release, users of the iPhone 5 commented on the fact that it bent even

though the smartphones weren't kept in their back pockets and sat upon. When the

iPhone 5S was released, the same symptom didn't take too long to pop up, with

users reporting that their smartphones bending at the volume button over a

period of time.



The root of the problem stems from the iPhone 6's anodized aluminium frame.

Though anodizing it makes it more durable and prevents it from rusting,

aluminium by its very nature is a rather soft metal. With the iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus only being a few millimetres thick, it's not surprising that they

can be bent by applying a little bit of pressure. Unfortunately, this also means

that the surface of the phone starts cracking. What a great new feature.



It's actually quite staggering that the same structural vulnerability is present

in iPhones from two different generations. One would have thought that Apple

would have already fixed it. I'm looking forward to seeing how Apples PR team is

going to respond to this; I wouldn't be surprised if they say that Apple have

created the first flexible smartphones in existence. Apples rivals, such as

Samsung, have however quickly publicised the claims of the structural flaw

through social media.



Update: Apple has responded to the allegations by saying that such damage would

be "rare" during normal use, with only 9 users reporting directly to Apple about

the flaw. Apple is also going to replace your iPhone using their Visual

Mechanical Inspection test.
