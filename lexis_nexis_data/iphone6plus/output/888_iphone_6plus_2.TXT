Apple hasbegun preorders of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+ smartphones from 12:01 am

on October 7, reports Gulveen Aulakh in New Delhi. Sales of the devices start 10

days later. Retailers and carriers are finalising payment & data bundling

offers.



Large format retailers are busy lining up easy payment options while top

carriers Bharti Airtel and Reliance Communications are finalising data bundling

offers as Apple begins pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones

from 12:01 am on October 7, and starts selling them 10 days later.



Apple will sell the smartphones from October 17 in three storage variants

through its official distribution partners Redington, Ingram Micro and Rashi

Peripherals. The 4.7-inch 16 GB iPhone 6 will cost . 53,500, the 64 GB storage

variant ` will come for ` . 62,500, while the 128 GB has a price tag of ` .

71,500, according to Redington's website. The 5.5inch screen iPhone 6 Plus will

be priced higher than its smaller counterpart with the 16 GB variant priced at

`. 62,500 and the 64 GB model costing `. 71,500. The 128 GB variant is the most

expensive, at ` . 80,500.



"The devices will be available at all leading modern trade stores and retail

outlets across India," Ingram Micro said in a statement on Monday. Infibeam, the

sole authorised online retail partner of Apple for iPhones in India, said that

it will begin taking pre-orders of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus online, for

deliveries on October 17.



Interestingly, the prices for iPhone 6 are the same as those of the iPhone 5S

launched last year, the 16 GB variant of which helped Apple cross the 1

million-mark in India iPhone sales within its financial year ended September

2014, for the first time ever.



Some retailers that ET spoke to said that they have received a rush of inquiries

for the latest devices which it launched in the US on September 9, even as Apple

is yet to decide on the stocks that will be given to each of the retail chains.

Some caution that limited stocks -thanks to continuing strong global demand and

start of the devices' sale in China on October 17 \xAD may leave many aspiring

buyers disappointed.



"We've been getting inquiries since the US launch and this time, pre-orders are

beginning 10 days in advance, which is a big surprise be



cause usually pre-orders in India are limited to 3-4 days that we've seen in the

past," said Himanshu Chakravarti, CEO of The Mobile Store, India's largest

retail chain with 450 stores selling mobile phones.



The long pre-order period, some say, is aimed at cornering a chunk of buyers in

the premium segment as Diwali approaches. Recent weeks have seen a slew of

launches in the high-end segment, with Sony launching its flagship products

Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact last week at .



`51,990 and .



`44,990, respectively. BlackBerry launched its Passport smartphone a week back

for .



`49,990 while Samsung introduced the Galaxy ALPHA smartphone for .



`39,990, and is scheduled to launch the Galaxy Note 4 before Diwali.



To push Apple sales, The Mobile Store will offer EMI scheme to buyers who use

credit cards to make the purchase, and it is also planning to accept pre-booking

of the iPhones at its retail stores for a token amount which could be as low as

a few thousand rupees, Chakravarti said.



Satish Babu, founder of Chennaibased retail chain UniverCell, said that the

demand has been "very good, irrespective of the bending issues or grey market

pricing", but added that Apple had not confirmed the number of units that will

be given to the larger retailers. The technology major may offer fewer stocks to

India since it faces far higher international demand and also since the company

will on October 17 begin selling the iPhones in China which is a much bigger

market compared to India, say sector watchers.



"Stocks will be very low," said a top executive at another large retailer on the

condition of anonymity. He added that an expected sales fore



cast would be done this week after which stock will be decided a few days before

October 17.



Despite a number of smartphone launches before Diwali, sector trackers feel

Apple is best placed to capitalise on the festive demand in the premium segment.

"They (Apple) will take a large share of the premium smartphone segment, without

doubt," said Chakravarti.



Mobile phone service providers Bharti Airtel and Reliance Communications, which

had partnered with Apple during the launch of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C last

year, will also sell the new models through their offline and online stores,

bundled with some data plans.



People aware of the plans of the telcos said that the companies were firming up

staggered payment options and financing schemes from banks for consumers who

would be lining up to buy the smartphones despite the ongoing tussle between

online and offline retailers.



"For a quarter (the iPhone) sales will jump, because of EMI schemes," said

Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder CEO at Greyhound Research.



He, however, added that sales would dwindle after a quarter or two and would not

be dramatically high, like in the US where Apple sold 10 million in the first

weekend, since the market in India will be limited to Apple users, many of who

are still not ready to move beyond the iPhone 5S.



"We spoke to about 400-450 iPhone users, did a small study and we found that

60-70% of iPhone users are not comfortable moving on. First, the iPhone 6 Plus

is too big, it bleeds into the iPad Mini. Second, many don't find anything

revolutionary different in the new devices," he said.
