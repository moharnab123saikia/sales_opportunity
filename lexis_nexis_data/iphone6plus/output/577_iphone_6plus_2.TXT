in Israel on October 27 at a price of NIS 3,800, the same price as the Galaxy
Note 3, launched in Israel exactly one year ago. Samsung is sticking to its
original launch date, instead of advancing it as in several other countries,
following the iPhone 6 launch. The new iPhone models will reach Israel on
October 23, with the iPhone 6 Plus, which will compete directly with Samsung,
expected to present a serious challenge to the new Samsung model in tis
category. The new iPhone is a phablet (a combination of smartphone and tablet),
just like the Note 4. While the Note 4 has a 5.7-inch screen with a touch pen,
the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen. The iPhone 6 Plus is expected to cost
NIS 4,400, NIS 600 more than the Galaxy Note 4.

Samsung launched the Note category in 2011, and has launched a new model in the
series every September since. The Galaxy Note 4 has a metal frame and a
glass-covered screen that gives a concave impression. The company claims that
the glass on its current model has better protection. The screen has a
resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels using Super AMOLED technology that provides
more living color.
