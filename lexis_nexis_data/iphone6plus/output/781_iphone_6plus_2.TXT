AS iPhone mania returned to Singapore on Friday, Apple's new jumbo-sized

offerings might just help it to reclaim consumers who had gone over to the

Android side in order to satisfy their large-screen cravings.



Now that the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus are available, the

jettisoning of other smartphones appears to have begun. Last week, trade-ins of

Samsung phones tripled week on week at US-based smartphone reseller Gazelle Inc,

according to reports. In Singapore, a redistribution of power from Android-based

handsets to iPhones is also likely to play out in similar fashion. "Old Apple

fans will return to the fold now that the phone screen sizes have caught up,"

said Clement Teo, a senior analyst at research firm Forrester.



Apple also has the advantage of timing. Said Ryan Huang, market strategist at

brokerage IG: "Another boost for Apple's market share is its earlier launch.

Despite an earlier unveiling of Samsung Note 4, Singapore is not likely to get

the handset before mid-October, giving Apple a one-month headstart."



The enthralment with the Cupertino firm's creations has not worn off here if the

figures are anything to go by. SingTel did not reveal how many registrations of

interest it received this year, but it said that more than 50,000 customers

tried to book an appointment to buy the new iPhones after getting through the

registration of interest phase. This implies a more enthusiastic response to the

handsets compared to last year when SingTel saw fewer than 40,000 registrations

of interest for the iPhone 5c and 5s. Even so, a record 68,000 people had

registered their interest for the iPhone 5 in the year before that.



The iPhone 6 Plus is sold out across all three telcos but gauging its popularity

relative to the smaller iPhone 6 is difficult, given how the supply of the

former is smaller worldwide, The Business Times understands. But even as

authentic fan frenzy was on display with arguments erupting at some resellers'

outlets here, this year's iPhone turnout had a distinctly scalper undertone.



By Friday afternoon, the new handsets were already listed for sale online, with

profiteers asking for about S$1,500 for an iPhone 6. Elsewhere, the iPhones'

delayed launch in China also created a scalping opportunity, with buyers

snapping up handsets in Sydney in order to resell them on the mainland.



Globally, the new iPhones are expected to outdo their predecessors yet again.

Apple took in more than four million pre-orders for the handsets in the first 24

hours of their launch last week - twice the number received for the iPhone 5 two

years ago. And while first-weekend sales for the iPhone 5s and 5c broke the

nine-million mark, analysts expect that those for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus

will hit 10 million units.



Apple's annual product bonanza has also become a re-pricing opportunity for

telcos here. All three players rolled out increases in mobile subscription rates

for new or recontracting customers ranging from S$2 to S$5 a month in the weeks

leading up to the sale of the iPhones. Even so, these phones tend to cost telcos

dearly in terms of handset subsidies, which can, "weigh a bit on telco expenses

for the quarter", said IG's Mr Huang. "This is likely to put a lid on any

earnings upside in the near term, but over the longer term, we should start to

see the price hikes help provide a good lift."
