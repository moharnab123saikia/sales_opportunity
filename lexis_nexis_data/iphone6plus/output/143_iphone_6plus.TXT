your pocket or when you try forcefully to bend it. But this is nothing to praise
about, because the phone is showing a major device flaw.

"Users of the new Iphone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have discovered a major design flaw
in Apple's new device: it bends by simply being in your pocket" says Rickey.

MacRumours too reports today "a small but growing number of iPhone 6 Plus owners
have reportedly bent their phones after carrying the devices in their pockets
just days after launch."

"Oh thank goodness I'm not one of the 10 million people who bought an iPhone
over the weekend", says Rickey. The handset is yet to hit emerging markets where
the phone has been delayed (in India).

Note that Apple has said that it has sold over 10 million new iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6 Plus models in just three days after the launch on September 19.

You can also look at the 'iPhone 6 Plus Bend Test' video posted by Unbox Therapy
on September 23rd. The video shows how the iPhone 6 bends on applying a little
pressure on the phone.

It is yet not known why the Apple iPhones are bending in the pockets.
