The eagerly-anticipated new iPhone model is incoming - and all eyes on are on

Apple for any potential updates regarding the forthcoming model's features.



Many have been left disgruntled by a rumoured loss of the headphone jack, but

luckily, a new rumour has emerged which people are VERY excited about.



According to the latest leaked images, Apple's next plus-size smartphone could

feature more internal storage than any of its predecessors - meaning more room

to download apps and store photos than ever before.



There have been rumours that Apple is planning to launch a 256GB model for some

time.



And now, a sheet outlining some of the key feature of the iPhone 7 Plus has

emerged on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, appearing to confirm the rumour.



The sheet clearly shows plans for a 256GB version of the device - doubling the

capacity of the largest iPhone 6s Plus.



This increase in storage is bound to go down well with Apple fans - after, all,

it's the same amount offered on the company's iPad Pro, costing an eye-watering

Â£739.

Recently, Apple has been facing issues in the form of the dreaded 'Touch

Disease', first spotted last week by gadget repair specialist iFixit.



According to reports, a growing number of customers have been sending their

iPhone 6 handsets in for repair after a grey, flickering bar appeared at the top

of their display.



Shortly after the appearance of this grey bar, the iPhone's touchscreen has

reportedly become unresponsive, rendering the device useless.



Apple and Netflix customers targeted by new scam



iFixit claims that the issue can be traced back to a structural design flaw in

the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus - meaning millions of handsets could potentially be

vulnerable.



Despite this revelation, it currently remains unclear how widespread the problem

is.



Several users have been left angry by their handset's vulnerability, with many

taking to the Apple website to report the issue.
