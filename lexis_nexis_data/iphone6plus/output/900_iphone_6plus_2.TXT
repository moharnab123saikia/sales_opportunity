Is the iOS 8 update too big for your iPhone?

Apple"s new-generation mobile software is now available for download, but many

users have hit a snag trying to install iOS 8 due to the size of the update.



iOS 8 requires at least 5.7GB of free space to be installed on most iPhone and

iPad models, according to the Global News. Previous iOS updates only needed

about 1GB of free space.



The free software will be pre-installed on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - which

New Zealand customers can pre-order starting from next Friday - but that doesn"t

help users with an older version of iPhone.



Many of those users took to Twitter to vent their frustration with updating to

the iOS 8 mobile operating system.



"just deleted about 1,000 pics so i can have enough storage for iOS8," Twitter

user @jords97 wrote.



Welp... I have no friends now.. Mostly because I deleted all my pictures, apps,

songs, and contacts. To make room for ios8.. &mdash; Zakry Hayden

A tip for updating your iPhone/iPad/iPod software is to connect your device to a

computer and download then install iOS 8 via iTunes rather than directly onto

your device through Wi-Fi.



It also goes without saying that you back up your device before downloading the

new software, as there is always a chance your data could be lost if something

goes wrong mid-installation.



And be prepared to wait. some users have reported total install times taking

over an hour.
