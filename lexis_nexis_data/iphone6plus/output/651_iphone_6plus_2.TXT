Apple ordered to stop iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus sales in China

According to recent reports, a ruling by a Beijing intellectual property board

has banned the sales of US tech giant Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus

handsets in China.



The Beijing intellectual property board's injunction prohibiting the sales of

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models in China was made public last week. The

injunction -- which has been suspended pending an appeal -- was based on Apple's

alleged infringement of exterior-design patents of a company called Shenzhen

Baili.



The legal scuffle between Apple and Shenzhen Baili -- which does not have an

official website; and is probably another name for smartphone startup Digione --

started last year. The tussle was rooted in Apple's failure to rescind a patent

which was granted to Shenzhen Baili by Chinese regulators for the exterior

design of its 100C handset, which looks somewhat like the iPhone 6.



The ruling by the Beijing intellectual property board is in accordance with

Chinese patent and trademark laws which tend to put multinational companies at a

disadvantage, by giving Chinese firms the ability to register trademarks and

technologies which are already being used in other countries.



Since the ruling by the Beijing intellectual property board - banning iPhone 6

and iPhone 6Plus sales in China - marks a setback for Apple in China, a Patently

Apple report has revealed that the tech biggie has filed a lawsuit to appeal the

ruling.
