Apple sure ditched the 4-inch display screen size in favor of bigger display

screens of 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches with the Iphone 6 and 6 Plus launched in

September 2014. But the company could soon launch a new 'MINI' iPhone with 4

inch display, latest rumors indicate.



In year 2014, Apple introduced two bigger handsets in the market, Iphone 6

launched this year started at INR 53,500 and iPhone 6 Plus started selling at

INR 62,500. The iPhone 5S launched in 2013 too was introduced at a price of INR

53,500 in India but the prices. But Apple did introduce easy installment

schemes, easy buy offers in association with network service providers like

Reliance and Airtel. With these, the Cupertino giant also reduced the prices of

the older handsets, and it also reduced the price of iPhone 4S 8GB model below

INR 25K to gain a foothold in budget markets, like India.



This time however it could alter its plans and could actually bring back the

4-inch iPhone as a new device in 2015. According to a news report in PCmag Cowen

and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri, in a note to investors this week has said

that "Apple may be working on three versions of the iPhone for 2015." These

could be a  successor of the 4.7 inch iPhone 6 (could be called iPhone 6S), a

successor of the 5.5 inch iPhone 6 Plus (could be called iPhone 6S Plus) and a

new 4 incher model in line with the new iPhone 6 design profile (could be called

iPhone 6S mini).



The specs could be similar to the iPhone 5S, says this report, but with similar

looks like the iPhone 6. Note that the iPhone 5S has sharp corners, but with the

iPhone 6 Apple used rounded corners and edges on the new iPhones.



What is also interesting is that Apple in year 2013 launches an iPhone 5S and

iPhone 5C (colourful iPhones). While the iPhone 5S were a huge success, the

iPhone 5C lagged behind its brother. The weak sales prompted Apple to reduce the

orders for iPhone 5C, according to a report in AppleInsider.



This iPhone did not get an upgrade this year. By November, this year media

reports said Apple would stop the production of iPhone 5C in year 2015. This

news also gives strength to the rumours that Apple could bring in the 4 inch

display as a cheaper option in a new handset, that could replace iPhone 5C.
