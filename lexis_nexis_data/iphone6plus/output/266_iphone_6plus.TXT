Today: The iPhone 6 is reportedly in the 'final stage' of approval process in

China, with lucrative sales likely not far behind. Also, Facebook surges as it

readies new ad platform, and Google sinks as EU widens its investigation into

it.



The lead: Apple may not have to wait much longer to sell iPhone 6 in China



Apple shares, which had been mostly lackluster for the past week, received a

shot in the arm Tuesday after a report that its new iPhone 6 is in "the final

stage of the approval process" in China. Apple jumped 1.56 percent, ot $1.58 to

$102.64.



Sources inside China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology told

Chinese news site Tencent that the review is expected to be completed "very

soon," Reuters reported .



Approval would be a boon to Apple, which sold more than 10 million new iPhone 6

and iPhone 6 Pluses last weekend despite the devices not yet being available in

China, the world's biggest smartphone market. About 15 to 20 percent of all

iPhone sales come from China.



It's no secret that Apple is eager to win approval from Chinese regulators. The

country is in the process of transitioning from 3G networks to 4G, a change that

could bode well for future iPhone sales as Chinese customers are waiting to

upgrade. "We believe consumers in China are on pause as they eagerly await the

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus," Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White wrote in a

note.



A Morgan Stanley report also found huge demand for the bigger-screen iPhone 6

Plus , with 51 percent of current Chinese iPhone owners indicating they would

want to upgrade to that.



Meanwhile, some Chinese consumers aren't waiting for the official release;

there's a thriving black market in smuggled iPhone 6's , the Washington Post

reported, with prices on the street as much as 10 times the retail price.



That pent-up demand, along with booming U.S. sales, has many analysts bullish on

Apple's future.



Opening weekend sales were "even more impressive given lack of initial China

availability," Goldman Sacs analyst Bill Shope wrote in a note. UBS analyst

Steve Milunvich agreed, noting sales were "respectable considering lack of final

approval in China (expected shortly) and supply constraints." Brian Blair of

Rosenblatt Securities noted that demand far exceeded supply: "If Apple had made

15 million iPhone 6 units available in the opening weekend, we think they would

have sold them all."



Some experts believe momentum from Apple's weekend, which generated an estimated

$7 billion in sales, will push overall Apple sales past $200 billion this year,

compared to $171 billion in 2013. "Apple's going to have a monster quarter," BGC

Financial analyst Colin Gillis told the Merc's Julia Love on Monday .



SV150 market report: Facebook jumps as it unveils new ad platform to battle

Google



Wall Street took a hit Tuesday , as investors pulled back after poor economic

news from Europe combined with concern over the fallout from U.S. airstrikes

against terrorist targets in Syria. Tech stocks were affected the least though,

and the SV150 even managed meager gains.



Facebook jumped 1.94 percent, or $1.49, to $78.29, after the Wall Street Journal

reported the Menlo Park social media giant would release a new ad platform next

week to help it better compete against Google for online ad dominance. Yahoo

stopped its stock freefall in the wake of Alibaba's record IPO, gaining 1.03

percent, or 40 cents, to $39.05, after confirming the purchase of Bookpad , an

Indian startup whose document-viewing product has been compared to Google Docs.

Alibaba, meanwhile, slipped another 3 percent, or $2.72, to $87.18. Shares have

fallen almost 8 percent since peaking after its IPO on Friday.



Google fell 1.02 percent, or $6.09, to $591.18, after Europe's antitrust chief

said his organization may expand its investigation of the Mountain View Internet

giant. "We have received complaints on the possible diversion of Internet

traffic toward Google services which are not search services, so this is a

possible third investigation concerning Google," commissioner Joaquin Almunia

told a European Parliament panel, according to Reuters.



San Mateo's SolarCity dipped 0.72 percent, or 44 cents, to $60.40, after

breaking ground on a new solar-panel factory in Buffalo, N.Y. Oracle,

Hewlett-Packard and Cisco all dropped around 1 percent after each of the three

were rumored to be in separate merger talks with data-storage maker EMC . Zynga

tumbled 1.64 percent, or 5 cents, to $3, after reports that its latest NFL game

is flopping with consumers. Milpitas-based chip-maker Nanometrics plunged 4.44

percent, or 72 cents, to $15.51, after being downgraded by Canaccord Genuity ,

and Palo Alto's Jive Software dropped 3.72 percent, or 23 cents, to $5.96,

hitting its 52-week low amid a 54 percent slide over the past year.
