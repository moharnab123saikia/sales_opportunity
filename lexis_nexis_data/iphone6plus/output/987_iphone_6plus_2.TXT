Splashed out for the new iPhone 6?



You might find it comes with an unexpected feature.



A number of owners have complained their new smartphone has become BENT after

only a few days being kept in a pocket.



The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - which cost £539 and £619 respectively - were

launched around the world last Friday.



New features include a larger screen surrounded by an aluminium frame.

But several owners have posted evidence that the phone bends all too easily.



One Apple fan named Hanzoh posted on MacRumours forum that his new iPhone 6 Plus

has been left distorted after only 18 hours in his pocket.



The issue quickly took hold on social media and has been dubbed 'bend-gate'.



One tech enthusiast even posted a video on YouTube to prove how easily it can be

done.



Apple has so far declined to comment on the alleged problem.



Does the new iPhone 6 really bend that easily?
