DATELINE: NEW YORK





Apple Inc said it sold a record 10 million iPhones in the first weekend after

its new, larger phone models went on sale in 10 countries on Friday.



The phones, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, drew more than four million pre-orders

on Sept 12, more than double the 2 million orders for the company's iPhone 5

model in the same period two years ago.



Analysts had estimated first-weekend sales of up to 10 million iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus models, based on the first-day pre-orders.



Last year, Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5S and 5C models in 11 countries,

including China, in the first weekend. Sales of the new models in China have

been delayed by regulatory issues.
