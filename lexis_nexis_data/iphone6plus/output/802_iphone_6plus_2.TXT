you hanging onto your old cellphone. But Orchard, a Toronto-based startup, could
help you finally bite into the market for Apple products, or help you replace
one you've lost.

The company is helping consumers take advantage of the news that Apple sold 10
million devices during the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus's opening weekend in September.

This spike in consumers upgrading means a boost to the iPhone resale market,
with the price of a 5S, 5 or 4S dropping at double the rate of last year,
according to Bruno Wong, cofounder of Orchard, which promises to provide a safe,
convenient way to buy or sell used iPhones.

Consumers can save more than $150 on an iPhone 5S compared to buying new, says
Wong, who adds that 60 per cent of Orchard's customers say they looked into a
new iPhone but found it too expensive.
