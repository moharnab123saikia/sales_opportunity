

Apple has unveiled the Iphone 6 Plus which flaunts a massive 5.5-inch display
and comes loaded with an array of impressive features and powerful
specifications. With such a huge display, the Iphone 6 Plus will be put against
Samsung's newly launched flagship Galaxy Note 4, which debuted at IFA in Berlin.

While Apple's new iPhone is certainly a monster with a new chipset, tweaked UI
with support for landscape interface, and iOS 8 software goodness, the Samsung's
newbie too boasts a QHD display packed in a 'more-metal and less-plastic'
design, and brings an array of advanced features on board.
