Apple has sold a record number of its new phones during the first 24 hours of

pre-sales.



The Cupertino-based tech company announced Monday that it has received more than

four million pre-orders for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. That's double the 2

million in pre-sales for the iPhone 5 in 2012, the last time Apple released

pre-order figures.



Apple also said Monday that demand for the phones exceeds its initial supply,

which means that some customers won't receive their new devices until October.



"iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are better in every way, and we are thrilled

customers love them as much as we do," Apple CEO Tim Cook said. "Pre-orders for

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus set a new record for Apple, and we can't wait to get

our best iPhones yet into the hands of customers starting this Friday."



Apple announced Sept. 12 that pre-sales for the iPhone 6 had set a new recordfor

the company, but did not give specific sales figures. The record-breaking sales

come despite an outage on the Apple online store on the Friday morning that

pre-sales began. The websites for the major carriers also experienced delays or

outages as the result of high demand.



The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be available for purchase on Sept. 19 at

Apple retail stores and authorized carriers.
