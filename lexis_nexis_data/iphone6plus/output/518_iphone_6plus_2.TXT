NEW DELHI: If you want to want to find nothing but the most luxurious gadget

gift for your valentine, then we have some good news for you.



Goldgenie, which specializes in high-end customized versions of high-tech

products, is launching the 24K Gold iPhone 6 Diamond Ecstasy limited edition for

Valentine's day.



According to the website, the phone will be customized exactly according to the

buyer's demand and depending on this, the phone 's price will start at $15,000

and go way up to $3.5 million.



Available in choice for 24-carat gold, rose gold or in platinum, the Diamond

Ecstasy iPhone is also offered with laser-engraved message on the rear of the

phone.



Just to recap, the two iPhone models take Apple to the big-screen smartphone

segment, sporting 4.7- and 5.5-inch screens respectively. The iPhone 6's

4.7-inch display sports a resolution of 1334x750p, while the iPhone 6 Plus'

5.5-inch display sports a resolution of 1920x1080p. iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are the

thinnest ever Apple has ever made. iPhone 5S and 5 are 7.6mm thick, but iPhone 6

and 6 Plus are even thinner at 6.8mm and 7.1mm respectively.



Powered by the new A8 processor, iPhone 6 is up to 50% more energy efficient, so

you can have higher sustained performance, claimed Apple. The 64-bit CPU

architecture-based A8 processor is 20% faster in application processing and 50%

faster in rendering graphics compared to its predecessor. It is able to sustain

performance-intensive tasks like playing a game at higher frame rates.



The two iPhone 6 models sport an 8MP iSight camera that features phase

detection. Despite no increase in camera resolution, iPhone 6 takes 43MP

panorama photos.
