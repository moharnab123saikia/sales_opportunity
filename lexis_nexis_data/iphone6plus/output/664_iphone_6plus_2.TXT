Apple fans gather for release of new iPhone



Just a year after Apple launched the iPhone 5S and 5C, the tech company have

released the hotly-awaited sixth generation of the handsets.



Apple have promised the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will be "bigger than bigger" and the

best iPhone yet.



The Plus model is wider, taller and heavier than its younger sibling.



Both promise a new operating system, iOS 8, 4G and longer battery life than

their predecessors. Users can look forward to 14 hours of 3G calling time for 6,

while the Plus boasts a huge 24 hours of talk time.



But the most exciting feature is a new integrated health app which works with an

in-built barometer and accelerometer to measure how many steps you take in a

day.



The phones can be linked up with the hotly anticipated iWatch - released next

year.



The cameras on the new models are the same as the 5S, at eight mega pixels, and

have the previous model's Touch ID Sensor, which allows owners to unlock their

phones in less than a second using just their fingerprint.



But the prices of the phones are eye-watering - even for Apple's standards.



The Plus will set you back £619 for the 16GB model, while the 128GB comes in at

a staggering £789.



The 6 may be slightly better value for money, at £539 for 16GB and £699 for the

128 GB model.
