SALES of Apple's new iPhones were on pace to beat the 10 million units the

previous versions logged in their first weekend last year, the company said

yesterday, sending its shares up nearly 2 percent. Apple did not disclose the

specific number of advance orders it received. Analysts had expected about 4.5

million for the first 24 hours, compared with 4 million during the first day

last year. The company said it was working to catch up to demand for the iPhone

6S Plus, the larger of the two new phones, which exceeded its forecasts for the

pre-order period. "Customer response to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus has been

extremely positive, and pre-orders this weekend were very strong around the

world," Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. Apple began taking pre-orders on

Saturday for the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, which will begin shipping on

September 25. After shattering sales records last year with the iPhone 6, Apple

has been dogged by questions of whether it can sustain the momentum this year.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus touched off a sales frenzy that led to a 32.5

percent revenue rise in the latest quarter from a year earlier. - Reuters
