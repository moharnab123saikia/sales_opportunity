Re-sales of iPhone 6s smartphones were lackluster in Hong Kong as they made

their debut the same day on the mainland



According to local information technology news website newmobilelife.com, up

until 6 pm on Friday re-sale prices even dropped to lower than official retail

prices.



Some sellers lamented that the new smartphones were not as appealing as before.



Silver iPhone 6s suffered the most. A 16GB version was sold HK$238 cheaper than

the official price. Its 64GB and 128GB version were priced HK$38 and HK$88

cheaper in the resale market.



Prices for the Rose Gold model stood their ground. The 16GB version sold for

HK$212 dearer. The 64GB and 128GB all sold for HK$512 more than the original

price.



The iPhone 6s Plus enjoyed stronger demand. However, people could only earn

HK$12 by reselling the 16GB Space Grey and Silver models.



Rose Gold models also enjoyed the highest price in the Plus family with 16GB,

64GB and 128GB selling for profits of HK$812, HK$1,312 and HK$1,512,

respectively.



Official retail prices start at HK$5,588 for the iPhone 6s with a 4.7-inch

display and HK$6,388 for the iPhone 6s Plus with a 5.5-inch display, according

to Apple's Hong Kong webpage.



On last year's debut day of the new iPhone, resale prices were as high as

HK$10,000 for an iPhone 6 and HK$16,000 for an iPhone 6 Plus. Official retail

prices were the same as for the iPhone 6s.



Digital product traders felt the simultaneous release on the mainland caused the

slump. Kesh Digital spokesman Cheng Fei said that this time supplies to the

mainland were abundant, especially in Guangdong province. He felt the demand for

iPhones from the mainland would be low this time.



Some dealers in Shenzhen's IT commercial zone Huaqiangbei said they would not

stock the new iPhone. They are competing for time. Even if they get the product

early, only a thin profit margin could be achieved.



The iPhone 6s, as a transitional product, does not attract a lot of consumers,

according to a shopkeeper at Huaqiangbei. People were obviously waiting for

iPhone 7, he explained.
