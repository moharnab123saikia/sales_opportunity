Berkshire Bank, America's Most Exciting Bank®, has announced that its Debit
MasterCard® can now be used with Apple Pay[TM]. Apple Pay is a mobile payment
and digital wallet service that lets customers make in-store and in-app
purchases at participating retailers.


Apple Pay adds a new dimension to mobile payments. With Apple Pay, Berkshire
customers will be able to use their debit cards directly from their iPhone 6,
iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch to pay for purchases at many of their favorite
stores. To pay, customers just need to hold their iPhone 6 near the contactless
reader with their finger on Touch ID and the payment is made. When paying for
goods and services within apps, Apple Pay is compatible with iPhone 6, iPhone 6
Plus, iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3.
Security and privacy is at the core of Apple Pay. Each transaction is authorized
with a one-time unique dynamic security code. Card numbers are not stored on the
device or Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned,
encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your Apple device.
