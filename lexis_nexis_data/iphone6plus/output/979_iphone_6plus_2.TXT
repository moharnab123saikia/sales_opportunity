For allegedly faking identities and documents to get a postpaid subscription

with high-end phones, four employees of a car company were arrested by the

police and Globe Telecom security in Cebu.



Employees of Kia Motors in SM Cebu City namely Girly Belleza, Allen Marie

Almario, Gerald Anthony Lizares and Wildredo Arabis have been arrested for

subscription fraud, according to Globe Telecom Inc.'s media release.



A joint team of Cebu City police and Globe Telecom security caught the suspects

in an entrapment operation after allegedly submitting fake documents to apply

for postpaid accounts that included provision for expensive smartphones.



Based on investigation, the four individuals all submitted fake documents, using

fictitious names, in acquiring postpaid subscription with high end phones, the

telecommunications company said.



Citing a police report, Globe Telecom said Belleza, a sales agent of Kia, got

two units of iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 5 while Almario, a cashier of the car

company, got three cellphone units including an iPhone 6, an iPhone 6 Plus and a

Samsung Galaxy Core Prime.



Another Kia sales agent, Lizares, was able to get two units of iPhone 6 Plus

while Arabis, an administrative employee of Kia, got two units of iPhone 6 and a

Lenovo handphone.



The arrested individuals have been detained by the police while criminal charges

are being filed against them.



The telco giant vowed to prosecute illegal activities involving their products

and services with the aid of its Protec01 campaign.



The campaign tackles the issues of weak passwords, the dangers of the auto fill

feature, online sharing of information and awareness on new software and other

factors that make an account unstable and vulnerable to danger, it said.
