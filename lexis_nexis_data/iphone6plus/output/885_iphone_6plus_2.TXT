LENGTH: 180  words





With the debut of the Apple Iphone 6, Iphone 6 Plus and iWatch, Apple has phased

out its some of its popular old-generation products which includes the company's

iPod Classic and iPhone 4S. After the announcements were made, Apple updated its

own store by adding the newly launched devices and removing the iPod Classic and

iPhone 4S from its store. Moreover, it has also discontinued 30-pin connector

chargers used with old iPhones including the iPhone 4S.



Apple has been following this tradition of phasing out old generation products

every time it introduces new ones. Last year as well, after the launch of iPhone

5C and iPhone 5S, the company had made the iPhone 4S available for free with

contract in the US. And now it has pulled it from its store. Likewise, this year

as well the company has mentioned on its official site that with the launch of

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the market, the company will be making the iPhone

5C free for users on two years contract. Also it has slashed the prices of

iPhone 5S starting from $99 with two years contract with operator in the US.
