India, Sept. 23 -- Tech giant Apple on Monday said that it has set a new record

US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore

and the UK and will be available in more than 20 additional countries on

September 26.



Commenting on the development, Apple, CEO, Tim Cook said, "Sales for iPhone 6

couldn't be happier. We would like to thank all of our customers for making this

our best launch ever, shattering all previous sell-through records by a large

margin."



iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are the biggest advancements in iPhone history,

featuring two new models with stunning 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch Retina® HD

displays, and packed with innovative technologies in an all-new dramatically

thin and seamless design that is still comfortable to hold and easy to use.
