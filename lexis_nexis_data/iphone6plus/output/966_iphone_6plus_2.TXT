Demand for Apple Inc.'s new iPhone 6 looks strong, but the smartphone's average

sale price (ASP) could also get a significant lift versus previous versions.



RB C Capital Markets' survey of 6,000 people on their purchasing plans

demonstrated relatively even demand for the iPhone 6 (36%) versus the iPhone 6

Plus (35%). "Given the $100 ASP premium the 6 Plus carries, this will boost ASPs

higher than investor expectations, which were initially calling for 25- 30% of

iPhone demand being the larger form-factor," RBC analyst Amit Daryanani told

clients.



He noted that the quarter- over-quarter move in the ASP could be US$90 higher

and US$65 better on an annual basis.



Meanwhile , the results suggest Apple could generate iPhone ASPs of

approximately US$700. The survey also indicated that consumers are opting for

the 64-GB version as opposed to the 16-GB or 128-GB models.



Mr. Daryanani noted that roughly 48% plan to buy a 64-GB model, which is a

16-point gain compared with the current installed base.



"Not only does the shift towards 64GB drive pricing higher ($100 premium) but it

also provides upside to gross margins," he said, adding that Apple makes an

estimated 85% gross margin on memory.



The analyst raised his target price on Apple shares to US$114 from US$110 to

reflect both the higher ASPs and iPhone 6 demand.



He also hiked his revenue and earnings per share forecasts for Q4 2014

(September) and Q1 2015 (December).



RBC's revised estimates are US$40.8-billion and US$1.33, and US $6 6. 7 -billion

and US$2.64, for those periods, respectively.
