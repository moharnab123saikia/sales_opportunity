Apple has finally launched the much awaited iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 at WWDC

2014 on its Silver Jubilee, yesterday. Finally, my social and tech news feed can

take a back seat with all the rumored specs and product leaks. However, most of

them were fairly accurate. Being an Android convert myself since iPhone 3GS; I

can safely say, I'm not going to be reverting back anytime soon, yet.



On paper the specs are pretty straight forward;

Don't be fooled by A8 2-Core 2.7 GHz, which on paper is 2 less cores than Note 4

or G3, but keep in mind it's a 64-bit processor rather than the 32-bit and hence

they were able to pull off similar user experience with a mere 1GB on its

predecessor, iPhone 5S and that now has been bumped up to 2GB for iPhone 6.

Being a current Samsung Galaxy Note 3 owner, I was secretly hoping that Samsung

Galaxy Note 4 would come out with the new 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 808/810 to

be on par with Apple processors in that domain. Although, there are elements of

iPhone 6 hardware that are really sub-standard when compared to the latest

Android devices out there in the market from Samsung, LG, HTC or even Huawei,

but iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite features are going to play a key role in setting

iPhone 6 apart from the rest, especially, if your other devices are already in a

MAC environment. Nonetheless, we will have to wait and see how iPhone 6 performs

side by side with other devices along with some in depth stress testing.
