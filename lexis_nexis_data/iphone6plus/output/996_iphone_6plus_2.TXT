It has not been very long since Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have been out.

However, the rumour mill has already started churning 'details' about Apple's

next iPhone(s). Thanks to sources from Taiwan, 'potential' features of the

next-generation iPhone have surfaced. A look at six likely features of what is

to come:



1. Two lens camera



It is being reported that Apple will use a two-lens system in the camera module

of the next-generation iPhone. The dual lens setup will allow the iPhone to

capture more light, resulting in better photos. Apple will also add optical zoom

capability to the phone's camera, resulting in better photos compared to cameras

with digital zoom, as per rumours.



2. Force touch



Apple will reportedly use its Force Touch technology in the upcoming iPhones.

This technology, already being used in Apple Watch, will allow the touchscreen

to distinguish between light taps and long presses, enabling users to interact

with their iPhones in several new ways.



Moreover, the touch sensors said to be used in the new iPhones will be able to

determine the users' blood pressure and pulse more accurately.



3. Same screen sizes



The anonymous supply chain sources cited in the report also mention that iPhone

will stick to the current crop of screen sizes, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch.



There is no mention of the rumoured 4-inch iPhone 6S model yet.



4. Minimum 32GB storage



Apple is also said to be upgrading the minimum storage option in next-generation

iPhone to 32GB, from the current 16GB.



With the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Apple had eliminated the 32GB storage option

allowing users to choose between 16GB, 64GB and 128GB options.



5. RAM 2GB



The next-generation iPhone will also reportedly get a memory upgrade.



According to sources from Taiwan, Apple may finally endow the next generation

iPhone with 2GB RAM.



While the close integration between the software and hardware ensures a smooth

user experience, the bump in RAM will facilitate better multitasking.



6. New A9 processor



The next-generation iPhone will be powered by Apple's new A9 processor. Just

like the A8 processor, Apple's new A9 processor will be based on 64-bit

architecture. There are conf licting reports on which company will make the

processor.



Some reports suggest that Apple will go to Samsung to get the chip made as its

foundries support 14nm FinFET chips, that offer improved performance and use

less power. However, some other reports claim that Taiwan Semiconductor

Manufacturing Company (TSMC) will produce most of the A9 application processors.
