

On Wednesday, US wireless carrier T-Mobile announced a new initiative under
which it will sell tech giant Apple's new iPhones -- iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s
Plus -- for $5 per month with trade-in. The new iPhones are set to hit the
markets on September 25.

The new initiative announced by T-Mobile will enable customers to purchase the
iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus smartphones for a monthly payment as low as $5, if
they trade in an 'eligible' smartphone. The deal does not require customers to
make any down payment.

The eligible smartphones which customers can trade in -- to avail a $5-per-month
price for the new iPhones -- include iPhone 6; iPhone 6 Plus; Samsung Galaxy S6;
Galaxy S6 Edge; Galaxy S6 Edge+; and Galaxy Note 5. Any of these handsets can be
traded-in by customers, provided that the handsets are in working and undamaged
condition.

Other than the mentioned handsets which can be traded-in by customers to
purchase the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus at $5 per month, the new promotion
announced by T-Mobile also allows customers to purchase the 16GB iPhone 6s by
paying $10 per month for 18 months if they trade in an iPhone 5s, Samsung Note
4, or Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone.

Furthermore, under the new promotion, customers can also trade-in almost any
other smartphone, and purchase the new iPhones for $15 per month.
