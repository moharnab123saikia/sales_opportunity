inside peoples' pockets.

Apple said that bends in their new iPhone 6 Plus phablets are 'extremely rare'.
"Through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted us
with a bent iPhone 6 Plus," an Apple statement said.



Their statement follows rumours that Apple's latest product was prone to bending
inside people's pockets. A Youtube video by Unbox Therapy that showed someone
bending the phablet with his hands quickly went viral, amassing 38 million views
in five days.

As a response to this controversy, Apple invited journalists from the Wall
Street Journal, Recode and the Verge to watch their testing facilities. The
papers reported that the phones go through heavy tests, including one that
places weights of 25kg on the centre of the phone. In another test, the phablet
is twisted around 8000 times with a machine clamping both ends.

"iPhone 6 plus phablets feature a precision-engineered unibody enclosure
constructed from machining a custom grade of 6000 series anodized aluminium,
which is tempered for extra strength," Apple said. "They also feature stainless
steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high-stress locations and uses the
strongest glass in the smartphone industry."
