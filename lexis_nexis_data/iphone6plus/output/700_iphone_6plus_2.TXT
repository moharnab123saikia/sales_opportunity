Bend in iPhone 6 Plus 'extremely rare'- Apple



LENGTH: 215  words





Apple dismissrumours that their new iPhone 6 Plus phablets are prone to bending

inside peoples' pockets.



Apple said that bends in their new iPhone 6 Plus phablets are 'extremely rare'.

"Through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted us

with a bent iPhone 6 Plus," an Apple statement said.







Their statement follows rumours that Apple's latest product was prone to bending

inside people's pockets. A Youtube video by Unbox Therapy that showed someone

bending the phablet with his hands quickly went viral, amassing 38 million views

in five days.



As a response to this controversy, Apple invited journalists from the Wall

Street Journal, Recode and the Verge to watch their testing facilities. The

papers reported that the phones go through heavy tests, including one that

places weights of 25kg on the centre of the phone. In another test, the phablet

is twisted around 8000 times with a machine clamping both ends.



"iPhone 6 plus phablets feature a precision-engineered unibody enclosure

constructed from machining a custom grade of 6000 series anodized aluminium,

which is tempered for extra strength," Apple said. "They also feature stainless

steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high-stress locations and uses the

strongest glass in the smartphone industry."
