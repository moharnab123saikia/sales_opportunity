yesterday after hours queuing for the new device.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus - priced from $868 to $1249 - hit the shelves at
8am but were quickly snapped up by those who camped overnight at shopping
centres across Melbourne.

Johnny Guan was the first to buy the iPhone 6 Plus at Highpoint Shopping Centre
after waiting 31 hours.

"It was worth it too because I was one of the first to get one," he said. "If
people come here again next year when the next one is released, I'll be here."
Diehard Apple supporters even flew to Melbourne from Taiwan - where the phone is
yet to be released - to nab the latest models.

The hysteria reached auction websites just hours after the release with some
phones being on-sold for hundreds of dollars above the retail price.

St Kilda's Brooke Carlson braved the elements to sleep the night outside the
Telstra store in Bourke Street.

"With the new software that came out there is so much more you can do with this
phone," she said.

"This is a big adjustment from the last iPhone so waiting was definitely worth
it." Apple announced earlier this week that it was inundated with a record
number of pre-orders, with more than four million people's order placed in the
first 24 hours. But the joy was short-lived, with Apple's Highpoint store
quickly selling out of the iPhone 6 Plus.

Xin Jin queued from more than nine hours, but was told the souped-up model -
with a bigger screen and better camera - had already sold out.

"We were about 30 in the queue but still didn't get one," he said. "Others have
told us that they only has eight (iPhone 6 Plus) in stock. Everybody is
disappointed."monique.hore@news.com.au
