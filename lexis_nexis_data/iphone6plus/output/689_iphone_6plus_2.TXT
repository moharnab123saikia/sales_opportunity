

APPLE said yesterday that sales of its new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are on track to
beat last year's record-breaking iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sales on the first weekend
they hit the shops.

"Customer response to iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been extremely positive
and pre-orders this weekend were very strong around the world. We are on pace to
beat last year's 10m unit first weekend record when the new iPhones go on sale
September 25," the technology giant said in a statement to CNBC.

The California-headquartered company said it had experienced large demand
online, but did not reveal exact figures. Analysts have estimated sales of
around 4.5m during the first 24 hours, compared with 4m during the first day
last year.

"As many customers noticed, the online demand for iPhone 6s Plus has been
exceptionally strong and exceeded our own forecasts for the pre-order period. We
are working to catch up as quickly as we can, and we will have iPhone 6s Plus as
well as iPhone 6s units available at Apple retail stores when they open next
Friday," it said.

Last year's record sales beat that of the previous iPhone 5s and 5C in 2013,
which stood at 9m after three days.

Investors and analysts have voiced concerns over whether Apple can sustain its
growth momentum, but the market seemed reassured yesterday. Shares in Apple were
up by nearly two per cent in early trading and closed 0.96 per cent higher.
