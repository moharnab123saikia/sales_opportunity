 TORONTO, ONTARIO: BMO Financial Group today announced it will offer Apple Pay

to its Canadian customers, allowing customers to make easy and secure purchases

with their BMO credit and debit cards.





 "We have a long track record of bringing to market innovative products and

services that help enhance and simplify our customers' lives. The introduction

of Apple Pay for BMO customers is the latest example," said Cameron Fowler,

Group Head, Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, BMO Financial Group.

 He added that the adoption of mobile payments has accelerated since BMO

launched Mobile PayPass Tag in 2011. "This is a natural next step in this

journey that we're taking with our customers in Canada, as well as the United

States - where we've been offering Apple Pay for the past year," said Mr.

Fowler.

 Coming soon to BMO customers, Apple Pay is easy to set up and users will

continue to receive all of the rewards and bene[#xfb01]ts offered by credit and

debit cards. In stores, Apple Pay works with iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s

Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch.

 Online shopping in apps accepting Apple Pay is as simple as the touch of a

finger with Touch ID, so there's no need to manually fill out lengthy account

forms or repeatedly type in shipping and billing information.

 When paying for goods and services within apps, Apple Pay is compatible with

iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3,

iPad mini 4 and iPad Pro.
