Best phone camera

Apple iPhone 6 Plus



The Sony Xperia Z3's ruggedness means never having to worry about rain or sand

when taking photos. But the Z3's results look way too saturated for our liking.



If you adore selfies, HTC's Desire Eye, with its 13-megapixel front-facing

camera, is the one to use.



LG's G3 produced better selfies, with the right skin tones and great sharpness.

Unfortunately, it lost out to both the Apple iPhone 6 Plus and Samsung Note 4

4G+ in terms of overall camera performance.



In fact, it was a close fight between the idiot-proof people's camera of the

iPhone 6 Plus and the much-improved camera of the Galaxy Note 4. Both are easy

to use and produced excellent pictures with crisp details.



But while Galaxy's higher megapixel count meant more details, it did not do so

well in low-lighting conditions. The iPhone 6 Plus produced better

natural-looking images with or without flash.



As a more solid all-rounder, the iPhone 6 Plus' camera is the winner, just

edging out the Galaxy Note 4.



Other finalists:





o HTC Desire Eye

o LG G3

o Samsung Galaxy Note 4 4G+

o Sony Xperia Z3
