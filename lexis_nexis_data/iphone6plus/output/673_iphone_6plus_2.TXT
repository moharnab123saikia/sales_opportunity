The Sony Xperia Z3's ruggedness means never having to worry about rain or sand
when taking photos. But the Z3's results look way too saturated for our liking.

If you adore selfies, HTC's Desire Eye, with its 13-megapixel front-facing
camera, is the one to use.

LG's G3 produced better selfies, with the right skin tones and great sharpness.
Unfortunately, it lost out to both the Apple iPhone 6 Plus and Samsung Note 4
4G+ in terms of overall camera performance.

In fact, it was a close fight between the idiot-proof people's camera of the
iPhone 6 Plus and the much-improved camera of the Galaxy Note 4. Both are easy
to use and produced excellent pictures with crisp details.

But while Galaxy's higher megapixel count meant more details, it did not do so
well in low-lighting conditions. The iPhone 6 Plus produced better
natural-looking images with or without flash.

As a more solid all-rounder, the iPhone 6 Plus' camera is the winner, just
edging out the Galaxy Note 4.
