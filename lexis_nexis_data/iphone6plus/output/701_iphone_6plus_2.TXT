Apple ready to replace bend iPhones of customers



LENGTH: 229  words





After the news and pictures of Apple Iphone 6 and 6 Plus bending comes up, Apple

has responded and said that it is ready to replace the damaged iphones.



According to a news report in The Next Web that in an online conversation with

Apple's support desk, Apple has agreed that it will replace the faulty handsets.



The report says the Apple representative answering about which handset will

qualify for a replacement said "That is 100 percent up to the Genius you speak

with at the store. There is a test called a Visual Mechanical Inspection that

the device will have to pass. If it is within the guidelines, they will be able

to cover it. If not, the replacement would be a paid one."



"The staffer offered to escalate the issue to a call with a senior support

advisor. We declined, but it's good to know that Apple is taking the issue

seriously," says The Next Web.



Well, though an official statement is yet to come from Apple, this news is good

for those who are worried about the new iphone.



Today in another bend test of the Iphone 6, Unbox Therapy finds that the smaller

iPhone, the iPhone 6 phone refused to bend. The glue that sticks the display

screen to the phone body seems as coming out which can be put back easily. This

is considerably better than the iPhone 6 Plus.



Yesterday Unbox Therapy easily bend an iPhone 6 Plus by applying pressure on the

back side of the phone.
