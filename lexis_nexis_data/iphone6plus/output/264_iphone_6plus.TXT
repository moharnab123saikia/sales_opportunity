New Delhi, Sept. 11 -- Apple will make its new smartphones iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

Plus available to customers in India from October 17. The devices will hit the

US stores on September 19 and Apple enthusiasts in India need to wait less than

a month only, unlike the long wait in the case of previous editions of the

iPhone.



Incidentally, the company makes the new smartphones available in the country in

the midst of festive season. Prices of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, however, have

not yet been disclosed.



In the past, Apple smartphones were made available in India around November.

IPhone 5S for the 16GB version is retailing in India at about Rs 41,500. Apple

unveiled two thinner and larger screened smartphones, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6-Plus

yesterday as the tech giant looks to fend off competition from Korean handset

maker Samsung.
