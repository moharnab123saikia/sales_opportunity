attendants



LENGTH: 303  words



DATELINE: Washington





Association of Fight Attendants-CWA has issued the following news release:



United Airlines announced the carrier will equip its flight attendants with

Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, putting important safety and service information at

flight attendants' fingertips while enhancing their ability to meet customers'

needs.



The airline will begin distribution to its more than 23,000 mainline flight

attendants during the second quarter of 2015. Upon introduction, the devices

will have the ability to handle most onboard retail transactions and will enable

access to company email, united.com and the company's Intranet as well as

policies and procedures manuals.



Future enhancements include replacing the flight attendants' printed safety

manual with an electronic version on their iPhones and providing real-time

reporting and improved follow-up on aircraft cabin issues and repairs.

Additionally, United plans to develop a number of customer-focused tools for the

device.



"We are thrilled to make this investment in our flight attendants," said Sam

Risoli, United's senior vice president of inflight services. "iPhone 6 Plus will

enable them to deliver an even higher level of flyer-friendly service and will

offer our flight attendants simple, one-touch access to valuable work

information, enabling them to better serve our customers."



The deployment of iPhone 6 Plus for United flight attendants follows the

airline's deployment of iPads to pilots beginning in 2011, in a move toward

creating paperless aircraft and flight decks. United has renewed the iPad pilot

program with iPad Air 2. - See more at:
