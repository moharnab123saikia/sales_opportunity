LENGTH: 381  words





Monday, October 20, 2014: Vuzix Corporation (OTCQB: VUZI), a leading supplier of

Video Eyewear and Smart Glasses products in the consumer, commercial and

entertainment markets, today announced that with the release of the OS 2.0

upgrade for the M100 Smart Glasses, compatibility with iOS devices is enabled

and iPhone and iPad support is being prepared to ship. The M100 Smart Glasses

Manager application for iOS is now in final test for submission to Apple for

iTunes launch approval.



With iOS support, the M100 will connect seamlessly to most iOS devices including

the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The Smart Glasses Manager application allows

the M100 to be controlled by iPhones and enables features like Bluetooth

hands-free headset coms, streaming audio, and many other advanced M100 Smart

Glasses capabilities including support for both M100 native applications and

M100 legacy Android applications alike.



"We delivered the M100 Smart Glasses OS 2.0 upgrade just in time for the new

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus launch. As many of our Enterprise customers use the

iOS devices by corporate mandate, it is critical that our products support the

iOS platform. The Vuzix M100 Smart Glasses Manager running on iOS allows

seamless integration of our Smart Glasses for both iOS centric enterprise

customers and avid prosumer customers alike." said Paul Travers, President and

CEO of Vuzix.



The Company's M100 Smart Glasses are effectively a wearable computer that

provides solutions for hands-free computing in mobile applications. The M100 can

also support advanced features like virtual and augmented reality needed in many

enterprise applications like warehouse picking and plant floor machine

maintenance. Managing these unique capabilities have been available only through

connectivity with Android devices but with this new release, the M100 now has

support for iOS devices including the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Vuzix'

award-winning M100 Smart Glasses contain a virtual display with an integrated

camera and dual core ARM processing engine that is powerful enough to connect to

the internet and run advanced applications on its own. With the M100 Smart

Glasses Manager running on an iPhone, the M100 will now work in harmony with the

iPhone as it was meant to be experienced.
