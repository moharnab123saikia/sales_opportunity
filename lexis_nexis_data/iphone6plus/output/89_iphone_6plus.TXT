ABSTRACT



Despite wide publicity over a problem, Apple said only nine customers had

contacted the company with a bent iPhone 6 Plus.



FULL TEXT



Social media channels have overflowed in the past week with commentary on

whether Apple's new iPhone 6 Plus bends under pressure, particularly in a pants

pocket.



It turns out that actual complaints to the company, at least so far, are much

less prevalent.



''With normal use a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six

days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone

6 Plus,'' Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said in a statement.



The statement comes after some early adopters complained that the new iPhone 6

Plus, which is significantly larger than previous generations of the iPhone, was

permanently bending from simply being carried in a pocket for long periods of

time.



After one new iPhone 6 Plus owner on Tuesday complained that his phone warped

after sitting in his front pants pocket during a long drive, the story was

quickly picked up by technology blogs and news outlets.



Lewis Hilsenteger, who runs Unbox Therapy, a YouTube channel dedicated to

showcasing the latest tech hardware, filmed himself straining to bend an iPhone

6 Plus with his bare hands. The video has been viewed more than 25 million times

in less than two days.



As Apple has grown bigger and more successful, it has also become a bigger

target for criticism. The company says it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus smartphones over the first three days of release, a record for the

company.



Some of the attention is self-inflicted, however.  In the past week, Apple

released a software update to the iPhone that was supposed to fix some early

bugs in an updated version of its mobile operating system, iOS 8.



The update made some users' phones unable to make or receive calls and also

rendered the touch identification technology software useless, according to

reports.



Apple quickly withdrew the software update about an hour after it was released

on Wednesday.



On Thursday evening, Apple issued another update to its operating system, along

with an apology. Fewer than 40,000 iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users were

affected by the previous faulty update, according to Apple.
