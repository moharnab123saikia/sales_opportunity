onto your old cellphone. But Orchard, a Toronto-based startup, could help you
finally bite into the market for Apple products, or help you replace one you've
lost.

The company is helping consumers take advantage of the news that Apple sold 10
million devices during the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus's opening weekend in September.

This spike in upgrading means a boost to the iPhone resale market, with the
price of a 5S, 5 or 4S dropping at double the rate of last year, according to
Orchard co-founder Bruno Wong. Orchard promises a safe, convenient way to buy or
sell used iPhones. Consumers can save more than $150 on an iPhone 5S compared to
buying new, says Wong, who adds 60 per cent of his customers say they looked
into a new iPhone, but found it too expensive.
