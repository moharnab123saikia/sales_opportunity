The $700-plus price tag of an Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus could leave you hanging

onto your old cellphone. But Orchard, a Toronto-based startup, could help you

finally bite into the market for Apple products, or help you replace one you've

lost.



The company is helping consumers take advantage of the news that Apple sold 10

million devices during the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus's opening weekend in September.



This spike in upgrading means a boost to the iPhone resale market, with the

price of a 5S, 5 or 4S dropping at double the rate of last year, according to

Orchard co-founder Bruno Wong. Orchard promises a safe, convenient way to buy or

sell used iPhones. Consumers can save more than $150 on an iPhone 5S compared to

buying new, says Wong, who adds 60 per cent of his customers say they looked

into a new iPhone, but found it too expensive.
