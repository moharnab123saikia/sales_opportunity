How does the iPhone 7 Plus shape up?;

No headphone jack but there's a bigger battery with Apple's latest smartphone

Apple has got into a pattern of tick-tock updates. One year, it's a redesign of

the handset, the next it's an incremental update. This year, however, the iPhone

7 knocked it out of kilter a little.



Sure, the iPhone 7 has killed off the 16GB version and done away with the

headphone jack, but is there anything that really marks the new handset as

different from its predecessors?



 Outside



 On the outside, there's little to distinguish the iPhone 7 Plus from its

predecessor, unless you opt for one of the new colours - black or jet black,

which is a fingerprint prone glossy finish.



Perhaps the most notable change from the iPhone is the one you can't see but

that people have been asking for for some time: it is now water resistant. The

iPhone 7 Plus comes with an IP67 rating, which means it is dust resistant and

can be submerged in up to one metre of water for up to 30 minutes.



 Inside



 On the whole the physical changes to the iPhone 7 Plus are minimal. On the

inside, it's a different story. The chip is an A10 Fusion, Apple's most powerful

yet.



It has four cores: two high performance, and two high efficiency. If you've got

an iPhone 6, it runs about 40 per cent faster according to Apple's estimates;

it's about 20 per cent faster than the 6s.



The graphics performance has also got a bump, which means if you plan on using

your phone for mobile gaming, you'll be less likely to see the stuttering and

frame rate problems.



 The camera



 The star of the iPhone 7 Plus is the rear-facing dual camera. One is a

wide-angle lens with an f1.8 aperture that will allow more light into your

shots, the other a 56mm zoom lens that gets you closer to the action.



Optical image stabilisation was introduced with the 6 Plus, and has now been

extended to the smaller handset.



The front-facing camera has been bumped up to 7 megapixels from 5 megapixels.

That gives you better resolution for all those selfies, should you need it.

There's still a little softness around the edges, but on the whole the images we

captured were crisp and clean.



 Headphones



 Of course, there is the removal of the headphone jack. On the one hand, you can

see the Apple designers' reason for wanting to ditch it. It takes up space that

can be better used elsewhere, and it means that audio technology can go into the

headphones rather than into the phone, and in theory, we should end up with

better sound as a result.



But on the other hand it also means you can't charge your phone and listen to

music on headphones unless you go for Bluetooth headphones, which aren't

everyone's cup of tea.



So now you are faced with either buying a pair of Lightning headphones that will

only work with your iPhone, investing in wireless headphones, or using the

frankly ugly adapter for your old headphones. The adapter is included for free,

but it is just begging to be lost - I almost lost it three times in the space of

two days - and you won't always have it to hand when you need it.



 Home button



 The headphone jack isn't the only thing to go. Apple has also got rid of the

physical home button, in favour of a touch-sensitive button that gives haptic

feedback.



On the whole, the removal of the click home button isn't that big a deal though.

There is talk that this is preceding the eventual removal of the home button

altogether, leaving the iPhone with an edge to edge display.



 Battery



 The final thing is battery life. That bigger, brighter screen will require a

bit more power and the iPhone 7 Plus delivers. In a few days of testing, the 7

Plus battery lasted a full day of heavy use - although that may deteriorate over

time. For now, it's impressive.



 The good



 The camera is the stand out here. The dual camera system means you can get

closer to the action without having to reply on digital zoom, which is never

worth the effort.



 The not so good



 No audio jack. Yes, we can use Bluetooth headphones, but there are some times

when the audio jack is needed.



 The rest



 The display is about 25 per cent brighter than on its predecessor, and the

iPhone 7 Plus makes the most of the extra screen space.



 The verdict:



 The camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is certainly a good upgrade, particularly for

those who find smartphone cameras sub-par. For those who made the leap to the

iPhone 6s Plus, the iPhone 7 Plus is not an essential buy. But that won't stop

you wanting it anyway. HHHH
