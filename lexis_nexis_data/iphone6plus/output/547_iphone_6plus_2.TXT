Apple Inc. violated the design patents of a Chinese device maker and may have to

halt sales of its latest iPhones in Beijing, the city's intellectual property

authority ruled. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringe on Shenzhen Baili's

patent rights because of similarities to its 100C phone, the Beijing

Intellectual Property Office wrote in its decision. Apple, whose iconic gadgets

helped define the modern smartphone industry, said it's appealing the ruling and

is continuing to sell various iPhone 6 models during the process.



"IPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus as well as iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone SE

models are all available for sale today in China," Apple spokeswoman Kristin

Huguet said in an emailed statement. "We appealed an administrative order from a

regional patent tribunal in Beijing last month and as a result the order has

been stayed pending review by the Beijing IP Court."



While the decision covers only Beijing, future lawsuits against Apple could take

the case as a precedent, potentially influencing the outcomes of litigation

elsewhere in China.



Baili is one of scores of smartphone brands trying to cash in on the country's

mobile boom.



Xu Guoxiang, the inventor who holds the patent and listed as a Baili

representative, did not answer calls seeking comment.



Tim Long, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said he doesn't think

the impact of the Chinese ruling is meaningful.



"We believe there have been several prior cases against U.S. companies ruled in

favour of local companies by lower courts that were later overturned by higher

courts," Long wrote in a note to clients.



"We have seen dozens of court decisions banning different smartphone products

over the years in many different countries. We are not aware of one ever that

has resulted in an actual injunction." The ruling by the agency - which

administers matters involving patents in Beijing - is the latest in a series of

setbacks for Apple in its largest market after the U.S. Its book and movie

services were blocked in April for violating foreign publishing regulations. In

2013, state media accused the company of shoddy customer service and inadequate

warranties, prompting an apology from Apple CEO Tim Cook.



Last month, it lost its fight to keep the "iPhone" exclusive to its products

after a Beijing court ruled that a little-known accessories maker can use the

label for a range of wallets and purses. And in 2012, Apple paid US$60 million

to Proview International Holdings Ltd. to settle a dispute over the right to the

iPad name in China.



Apple has relied on the world's second-largest economy to sustain its pace of

growth, though it has begun to experience a slowdown. For the three months ended

March 26, revenue in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, fell 26

per cent to US$12.5 billion. Cook has pledged to continue investing despite an

economic deceleration. Bloomberg !@COPYRIGHT=Â© 2016 Postmedia Network Inc. All
