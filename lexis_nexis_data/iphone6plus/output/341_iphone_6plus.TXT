American Express cardholders in Canada get access to Apple Pay



LENGTH: 210 words





American Express has enabled its cardholders in Canada using the latest iPhone

models to use Apple Pay.



Apple Pay can be accessed by eligible Canadian consumer, small business and

corporate cards issued by Amex Bank of Canada.



Apple Pay will be supported on iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s

Plus, iPad and Apple Watch.



The service enables American Express cardholders across Canada to make purchases

both in store with compatible Apple devices at participating American Express

contactless merchants, and for making purchases within participating apps

accepting American Express.



Cardholders can pay in store with their Apple Watch, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus,

iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, as well as pay within apps through iPad Air 2, iPad

mini 4 and iPad mini 3.



Cardholders using an eligible American Express Card in Apple Pay can receive

real-time notifications and details for all purchases, along with seamless

connection to the Amex Mobile App for effective account monitoring, servicing

and access to rewards information.



Moreover, security is ensured as a card in Apple Pay is tokenised with a

different number than the cardholder's plastic card, with every payment

authorised with Touch ID or a passcode prior to the processing of the

transaction.
