Telecommunication service provider Ufone in partnership with Apple announced on

Friday the launch of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in Pakistan.



The popular smart phones will be made available to consumers under the banner of

the telecom service provider from Dec 11 this year.



Customers will be able to register online for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus from

Nov 28 at the company's website, a press statement said.



This is the first time that Apple has collaborated with a Pakistani

telecommunication provider for the launch of its signature Smartphone.



Apple is considered one of the biggest names in technologyrelated products and

is widely believed to be the world's secondlargest information technology

company.



Despite the phone's official unavailability in the country, iPhone enjoys a

large fan base in Pakistan, with many users already awaiting the entry of the

new product.



iPhone 6 was first officially introduced two months ago in the United States.
