APPLE yesterday launched a war on three fronts, with two big-screen iPhones to

tackle the phablet threat, a tap-and-touch payment system and a wearable device

it hopes will rule them all.



While the details of the new iPhones have been widely leaked, there were some

surprises including the name of the biggest phone in the Apple family: the

iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 is a 118mm phone and the iPhone 6 Plus is a 138mm

phone.



The iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus will both have a wireless communication

system which enables people to pay for goods with a tap-and-touch of their phone

at the checkout of bricks and mortar stores.



The payment system begins in America in October but there are no details yet

when it might be released in Australia.



The Apple Watch unveiled yesterday will come in a 38mm and a 42mm watchface, and

three modelsThey go on sale in Australia from September 17, with prices for the

iPhone 6 ranging from $869 to $1249.
