Mobile World Congress: A look at major tech launches



SECTION: HARDWARE



LENGTH: 1105 words





After CES, it's the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona or MWC that serves as a

global launch platform for all the big names from the consumer electronics

space. ET brings you a round-up of several new launches at MWC, most of which

are expected to reach our shores by mid 2014:



Androids with a Twist: Nokia's X Series



Nokia still enjoys a fair amount of brand recall, especially in emerging

markets. It's no wonder then that they announced a new range of entry-level

smartphones powered by Android. That being said, these are not your usual

low-cost Android phone - instead of the Play Store and the usual Google

services, they come with Microsoft services like Outlook mail, Here Maps and

OneDrive instead. The X and X+ have 4-inch screens while the XL has a 5-inch

screen. They all offer 3G with dual SIM support and are powered by dual core

processors. Expect sub Rs 10,000 prices for the X when it launches in April.



Samsung's MWC Blitz: Galaxy S5 & Three Smartwatches



As expected, Samsung took the wraps off its latest Galaxy S5 smartphone. Rather

than an all-new phone, the S5 features several improvements compared to the S4

including a better 16MP camera with faster autofocus, fingerprint scanner and

heart rate sensor (a first), all powered by a 2.5Ghz quad core Snapdragon

processor. Three new smartwatches also made their debut: Gear 2, Gear 2 Neo and

Gear Fit. The Gear 2 range now features interchangeable straps and is powered by

the company's own Tizen OS. The Fit features a curved OLED screen and is focused

towards fitness. The Galaxy S5 will be making its way over here in April for an

estimated Rs 49,990.



Vast Improvements: Xperia Z2 & Z2 Tablet



Rather than introduce completely new devices, Sony decided to drill down and

improve their flagship devices in every way possible. Both remain water proof as

before and feature similar designs. The Z2 smartphone offers ultra HD (4k) video

recording even though it uses the same 20.7 megapixel camera as its predecessor.

The screen is slightly larger (5.2-inch instead of 5) and it offers better

contrast and colours. It will be offered in multiple colours including black,

white and purple. The Z2 tablet is even thinner & lighter than before, features

the same size 10.1-inch screen but improved internals -- 2.3Ghz quad core with

3GB RAM. Storage is 16GB, but it can be expanded via micro SD. Like before, the

Z2 tablet will be available in WiFi and WiFi + 3G/LTE versions.



Tablet on a Diet: MediaPad X1



Huawei has really gone to work, redefining what a 7-inch Android should be like.

Billed as the thinnest, lightest and narrowest 7-inch Android tablet around, the

MediaPad X1 is just 7.18mm thick, has a bezel size of only 2.99mm and weighs 239

grams. The device is narrow enough to be comfortably held in one hand by most

users. Despite the diminutive size, Huawei has packed in a large 5,000mAh

battery, a 1920 x 1200 pixel 7inch IPS LCD, dual cameras (13MP rear with LED

flash + 5MP front) and 16GB (expandable) storage, all powered by a 1.6Ghz quad

core processor and 2GB RAM. Huawei expects users to keep it as a primary device,

so it also includes the ability to make phone calls. In an interesting twist,

you can use the X1 to charge another device, thanks to the large internal

battery. It should be priced between Rs 25,000 to 30,000.







An Affordable Trio: Lenovo S660, S850 & S860



Lenovo may be a top PC company but it's taking Android smartphones very

seriously too. The company announced three new smartphones, starting with the

S660 (4.7-inch, 1.3Ghz quad core, 1GB RAM, 8GB storage, 8MP/0.3MP cameras), S850

(5-inch 720p LCD, 1.3Ghz quad core, 1GB RAM, 16GB storage, 13MP/5MP cameras )

and the flagship of the range, S860 ( 5.3-inch 720p LCD, 1.3Ghz quad core, 2GB

RAM, 16GB storage, 8MP/1.5MP cameras and 4,000mAh battery). Lenovo also

announced the Yoga Tablet 10 HD+, a 10.1-inch multi-mode Android tablet with

1080p display, 1.6Ghz quad core processor, 2GB RAM, 16/32GB storage and 9,000mAh

battery.



Mid-range Monsters: HTC Desire 816 & 610



Not to be left behind, HTC announced the new Desire 816 and 610 at MWC. While

the Desire is mid-range, the 816 will be at the top of that range with a

5.5-inch display, 1.6Ghz quad core processor, 1.5GB RAM, 8GB storage

(expandable, with 128GB card support), front stereo speakers (BoomSound) and a

nonremovable 2,600mAh battery. It also has a 13 MP f2.2 rear camera & 5MP front

camera, all in a device just 7.99mm thick. The Desire 610 has a smaller 4.7-inch

qHD display and is powered by a 1.2Ghz quad core processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB

internal memory (expandable to 64GB).



Larger & Smarter: LG's G Pro 2



Expected to launch in March this year, LG's new flagship G Pro 2 is like a

larger version of the G2. It has the same back-mounted buttons and a new 'metal

mesh' back panel which provides better grip and is resistant to fingerprints and

smudges. The screen is a 5.9-inch 1080p unit while hardware includes the capable

Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad core processor, 3GB RAM and improved camera. LG

says that the G Pro 2 offers 20 per cent more effective optical image

stabilisation and 30 per cent louder sound compared to the G2. Sadly though, it

does not inherit the self healing properties of the LG G Flex. A new software

enhancement is the Knock Code security feature -- rather than just double tap to

wake the device up, you can have a secret knock pattern that wakes up and

unlocks the device in one go.



Design Déjà vu: HP Pavilion x360



Taking inspiration from the Lenovo Yoga range of tablets, HP's new Pavilion x360

is a touchscreen Windows convertible laptop with a hinge that can rotate 360

degrees. As you can imagine, this lets you use it as a laptop, tablet, stand or

a 'tent'. In tablet mode, the keyboard gets disabled to prevent accidental

input. It has an 11-inch 1366 x 768 pixel screen, Intel processor, 500GB hard

drive, three USB ports, HDMI out and has a starting price of just Rs 25,000

(estimated prices at time of launch).



More the Merrier: SanDisk's 128GB microSD



With everything going HD and beyond (Ultra High Def), people are running out of

storage space on their devices faster than ever. 64GB was the largest capacity

micro SD card available till date -- SanDisk decided that users needed more and

comfortably doubled that to 128GB -- all in a chip smaller than your fingernail.

Most of the new devices coming out this year (such as the new Samsung Galaxy S5)

already include support for this 128GB card. Note that this is also a class 10

card, able to read/write twice as fast as ordinary micro SD cards. It should be

priced between Rs 10,000 to 12,000.
