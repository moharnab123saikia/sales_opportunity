Google also showed a preview of Pixel C tablet that has same design like

Chromebook Pixel but runs Android Marshmallow



At the Nexus event, Google also announced a new kind of offering called Pixel C.

Pixel C is an Android Marshmallow tablet aimed to enhance productivity. While

Google didn't really use the word 'productivity' but it has added a keyboard,

presumably with this in mind to the large-screen tablet.



Google Pixel C features a 10.2-inch display and like Nexus 6P

(http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/google

-nexus-6p-launched/) and Nexus 5X

(http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/google

-nexus-5x-launched/) features a USB Type-C connector. Powering the tablet is an

Nvidia Tegra X1 chipset with 3GB RAM. The design eschews the design of

Chromebook Pixel and comes with magnetic keyboard.



Google said the keyboard has an 18.8mm pitch and attaches to the tablet via

magnetic latch and has bluetooth. The keyboard has its own battery and charges

when the tablet is folded with keyboard on top of the display via inductive

charging.



Google Pixel C doesn't come with a kickstand like Microsoft

(http://indianexpress.com/tag/microsoft/) Surface Pro 3 but when connected to

keyboard, the tablet can be adjusted from 100 to 135 degrees. Notable omission

here is the stylus.



Google says the both Pixel C and the keyboard will be available in time for the

holidays.
