convertible laptop-cum-tablet, along with the second-generation Chromecast.

Named Pixel C, the new device has a 10.2-inch display with 2560x1800p resolution
and 500 nits brightness. It runs on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) and packs the
quad-core Tegra X1 processor with 3GB RAM under the hood.

The compatible Pixel C keyboard supports inductive charging and will work for up
to two months on a single charge. Google has used a USB Type C port in the new
tablet, same as the new Nexus smartphones.

Google said the 32GB variant of Pixel C will cost $499, whereas the 64GB model
is priced at $599. The keyboard will be sold separately for $149. While there is
no official release date for the devices yet, Google said it will become
available in time for the US holiday season.

Now in its second iteration, Chromecast has shed the old USB-stick design and
now sports a circular body and multiple colours. According to Google, the new
Chromecast streams high-resolution content faster than its predecessor, with
less buffering. Its Fast Play feature allows it to connect faster with the TV,
the company said.

A music-centric device called Chromecast Audio, which lets users stream audio on
their existing speakers via Wi-Fi, was also announced at the event. The device
automatically recognizes devices on the same Wi-Fi network and 'casts' audio
from them to the speakers. It will support multi-room devices like Sonos.

Google says both Chromecast models will cost $35 (same as the first-generation
Chromecast) and will be available in 17 countries (no word on India launch)
starting today in lemonade, coral and black colours.
