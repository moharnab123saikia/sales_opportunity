Huawei MediaPad X1 Out soon, Â£329 from www.carphonewarehouse.com Love: Slim

styling, lightweight build, powerful camera, price. Hate: Average Android

custom-isation.



Technical stuff: 7in tablet, 1200 x 1920 pixels (323 pixels per inch), 239g,

16GB storage, memory card slot, Quad-core processor. HUAWEI, the Chinese company

responsible for last year's super-slim Ascend P6 smartphone, has delivered

another slender treat in the shape of the X1 which is just 7.18mm from front to

back.



It feels great in the hand and is likely to prove strong competition to the

Google Nexus 7 and even the iPad mini (the screen almost matches Apple's Retina

display), though Android still lacks the super-intuitive operating system of

Apple.



Huawei's major innovation in terms of Android customisation is the removal of

the app shortcut tray on the base of the screen.



More interestingly there are mini apps that can launch over others, so you can

look at your calendar while also browsing the web, say.



Battery life is very strong - and you can even connect a smartphone to it to

charge from the tablet, though you will need the right cable.



The cameras are great, 13MP on the back and 5MP on the front for great selfies.



And it comes with a slot for a 4G card, too.
