Laptop or tablet - or a mixture of both?



SECTION: TECHNOLOGY



LENGTH: 1107 words





There are two demands that dominate the laptop and tablet space today. Power and

weight. Users expect top-end performance without having to lug around devices

that are going to break their backs.



Size has dropped considerably in recent years, with suppliers finding it easier

to package more oomph into tighter spaces. The road, however, has been bumpy,

with some hybrid devices proving unwieldy for users.



The tablet that works like a laptop is, in many respects, the holy grail of

portable computing. Users want the functionality of both kinds of devices but,

crucially, with the weight and form of a tablet.



To date, only Microsoft has really succeeded in developing a hybrid with serious

performance, with its Surface line. The price of this range remains a concern

for some users.



Despite the hurdles, however, single service devices, ie, pure laptops and

tablets, have made significant strides in recent times.



Here, we break down some of the best options on the market to help you make the

right choice.



**Apple MacBook Air**



**Price:**from EUR 755.28



With Apple, there is always the caveat that some users will only buy Apple and

some will eschew it at all costs. For those in the former camp, there's a lot to

like here, with 1.4GHz of processing power, 4GB of memory and 128GB of flash

storage. On top of that, it comes with the iLife and iWork software packages,

incorporating word processing, spreadsheet and video editing programmes.

**HTC Nexus 9**



**Price:**EUR 308



The main appeal of the Nexus range, in both phones and tablets, was price for a

long time. Google's support meant that these devices performed at levels far

above contemporaries. Now, the Nexus range is in a price bracket more indicative

of its performance, and that means this tablet is swimming with the sharks. To

its credit, the Nexus 9 holds up reasonably well, but it's not the flat-out

bargain that the name once promised.

**Dell XPS 13**



**Price:**from EUR 1,219



Depending on specification, this Dell can be as thin as 9mm, although some

models go up to a still far-from-fat 15mm. The 13 inch device weighs between

1.18kg and 1.27kg, making it light enough to carry with ease. Picture quality is

the big seller here, with a 5.7 million pixel quad-HD display, effectively

packing more than double the punch of standard HD. The battery life of 15 hours

is impressive and, with extensions, can be increased by another eight hours.

**Dell Venue 11 Pro 7000 Series**



**Price:**from EUR 562



This Intel-powered device is a good halfway house for users who want more than

the Nexus 9 but aren't willing to go all-in on an Elitepad. With a 10.8 inch

full HD display, this is a device that is big but not too big and weighs a

manageable 733g. The Venue 11 comes with a stylus for note-taking and a choice

of 4GB or 8GB memory. It's not quite in Elitepad territory, but it's close

enough to be worth a look.

**HP Elitepad 1000 G2**



**Price:**EUR 1,405



This Elitepad is all about performance. At this price it would want to be. It

weighs 680g, is 9.2mm thick and it comes with either 64GB or 128GB storage. The

power is impressive and that's what is going to win over a lot of users to this

Windows based devised. It gets the job done with speed.



........



**Toshiba Encore 2**



**Price:**EUR 259



The balancing act with tablets is always a challenge. Staying light and thin

isn't a problem irrespective of power. Keeping the cost down while ensuring

impressive processing speed is. Toshiba has managed to get absolutely everything

it can out of a device in this price range, with the Encore 2 squeezing serious

performance into a package that won't break the bank. Again, it's not the

sexiest-looking device but you won't care about that at this

price-to-performance ratio.



........



**Apple iPad Air 2**



**Price:**from EUR 413.82



As with the MacBook Air, you either like Apple or you don't. In this instance,

it's another case of a device that will keep the fans happy. Weighing in under

half a kilo and just 6.1mm thick, this is about as thin and lightweight as you

could ask for. It looks shiny, as expected, and the display is a step up from

its predecessor too.

**HP EliteBook 1020**



**Price:**EUR 2,081



Very much on the lighter end of the scale, this HP weighs just 1kg and is 15.7mm

thick. If it's a compact device that packs a punch you are looking for, then

splashing out that little bit more on this device is probably worth it. Ideal

for videoconferencing, this device comes packed with a HD webcam, stereo

speakers and a dual-array microphone with noise reduction technology. This is

definitely aimed at the higher-end business user.



........



**Microsoft Surface Pro 3**



**Price:**from EUR 819



With the more consumer-focused Surface 3 due out in a few days, the Pro 3

remains the leader in hybrid devices. For all the price concerns, it's simply

got too much power and quality to ignore. This is, by a wide margin, the best

hybrid on the market, with ease of use in both laptop and tablet form. Users get

full performance on both sides. It's worth the extra bit of change.

**Linx Windows 8.1 tablet**



**Price:**from EUR 115.95



This is a great entry-level tablet for a user who just wants the basics. For its

price, it packs a decent amount in, but there's only so much a tablet around the

EUR 100 mark can do. Don't expect lightning speed in terms of processing, but

with a 12-month subscription to Office 365 and plenty of options in terms of

video and audio, this is great value for what it delivers.



........



**Toshiba Satellite Pro R50-B**



**Price:**EUR 387



Toshiba doesn't really go for style, and that's absolutely fine. All this

company does is deliver affordable, durable, and effective devices. Weighing in

at 2.3kg, it's far from the lightest device on this list, but it's hardly a

bruiser either. It packs a 15.6-inch non-reflective HD screen into its frame,

enabling you to focus on your work in clear high definition with no glare. If

you are looking for bells and whistles, you would be better served adding to

your budget. Instead, look at this as a practical workstation that gets the

fundamentals done with no fuss.

**Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon**



**Price:**from EUR 1,599.99



Lenovo has delivered a powerful device with its X1 Carbon. Unveiled at the

Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas earlier this year, this Thinkpad claims

to be the thinnest and lightest ultrabook, thin but powerful style laptop, in

the world at 17.7mm and 1.31kg. The form is going to appeal to a lot of users

and with up to 10.9 hours of battery life it's ideal for users who work

extensively away from the office.
