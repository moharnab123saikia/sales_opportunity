New Delhi: Lava International today unveiled its Iris X series with the launch

of its much awaited Iris X1. In the sub-8,000 price range, Iris X1 will offer a

very strong proposition with the latest Android 4.4.2 KitKat, power-packed

performance and a great design.



Currently, Lava Iris X1 is one of the few devices in India and the first one

from Lava that is built on the KitKat out-of-the-box platform, offering a

premium and smooth user experience. The platform offers faster multi-tasking

through optimized memory and improved touch responsiveness. Its new phone app

automatically prioritizes contacts based on the people a user talks to the most,

and its smart caller ID looks for matches from businesses with local listing on

Google Maps.



Lava Iris X1 takes a leaf out of the Iris Pro series as far as the aesthetics is

concerned. On the performance aspect, the smartphone provides an excellent

experience on the back of a 1.2 GHz Quad-Core Broadcom BCM23550 processor

powered by 1GB RAM. Iris X1 provides an excellent 3D gaming experience and video

performance with help of a specialized graphics engine based on Videocore

multimedia technology. Iris X1 sports a 4.5-inch FWVGA IPS (854 x 480 pixels)

display that offers high-quality colour-reproduction and great viewing angles.



Iris X1 sports an 8 MP rear camera with LED flash and a 1.4 Am pixel BSI+

sensor. The rear Camera supports full HD (1080p) video recording and playback,

comes with Auto focus, touch to focus functionality and HDR mode. It also

includes a 2.0-MP front-facing camera for video calling.



The device comes with 4GB of internal memory that is expandable up to 32GB via

micro-SD card. The dual SIM phone packs a long-lasting 1800 mAh battery

providing ample back up for multimedia payback, talk-time and stand-by.



Hari Om Rai, CMD, Lava International Ltd. said, "Lava Iris X1 is for the

consumers who not only want a high performance device but also a beautiful

design. Iris X1 is designed to mesmerize the consumers and will surely create

ripples in the market at this price point. We are confident that the latest

hardware and software features coupled with its great design will surely deliver

a rich experience to the consumers."
