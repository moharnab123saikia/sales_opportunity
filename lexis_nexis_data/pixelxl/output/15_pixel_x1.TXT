The latest smartphone runs Android KitKat out-of-the-box.



Monday, May 26, 2014: Looks like launching X series smartphones is a fad these

days. After Nokia's much-touted Android based X series smartphones, it is time

for our homegrown Lava International to come up with X series smartphones. Lava

has unveiled Iris X series, with the launch of Iris X1.



Price at Rs 8,999, Lava Iris X1 runs on the the latest Android 4.4.2 KitKat. It

surely is one of the few devices in the country, coming with Android KitKat

out-of-the-box. It allows the users to do multi-tasking through optimised memory

and improved touch responsiveness. It also comes with a bunch of new and useful

features. Its new phone app automatically prioritises contacts based on the

people a user talks to the most, and its smart caller ID looks for matches from

businesses with local listing on Google Maps.



Lava Iris X1 takes a leaf out of the Iris Pro series as far as the aesthetics is

concerned. The handset is powered by a 1.2 GHz Quad-Core Broadcom BCM23550

processor and 1GB RAM. Lava Iris X1 provides 3D gaming experience and video

performance with help of a specialised graphics engine based on Videocore

multimedia technology. The latest Android smartphone sports an 11.43-cm

(4.5-inch) FWVGA IPS (854 x 480 pixels) display. The company has rendered fully

laminated touch screen to the device, that eliminates the air gaps between LCD

and glass, making it look perfectly black in sleep mode. It is 8.9 mm thick and

weighs 138 grams.



The Iris X1 sports an 8 MP rear camera with LED flash and a 1.4 m pixel BSI+

sensor. The sensor increases the amount of light that gets captured and improves

low-light photography. The rear camera supports full HD (1080p) video recording

and playback, comes with auto focus, touch to focus functionality and HDR mode

that automatically snaps a rapid burst of photos to select the best possible

shot. It also includes a 2.0-MP front-facing camera for video calling.



The device comes with 4GB of internal memory that is expandable up to 32GB via

micro-SD card. On connectivity front, the dual SIM Iris X1 comes with 3G

connectivity apart from Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v4.0 BLE (Bluetooth low energy),

micro-USB and EDGE. It offers OTG support to enable file transfer through USB

drive on the move. The company touts that the phone can ofer better calling

experience courtesy the Dual MIC for Active Noise Cancellation. The phone packs

an 1800 mAh battery providing ample back up for multimedia payback, talk-time

and stand-by.



According to a press statement, Hari Om Rai, chairman and managing director,

Lava International Ltd., said "Lava is proud to announce the launch of 'X'

series with the Lava Iris X1, a beautifully crafted smartphone with best in

class hardware & software features. It is for the consumers who not only want a

price point. We are confident that the latest hardware and software features

Priced at Rs 7999, The Lava Iris X1 will be available in black and white

colours. It comes with an intelligent Flip cover powered by hall sensor that

puts the phone automatically in sleep mode ensuring reduced battery consumption.
