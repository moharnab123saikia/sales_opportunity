Huge potential seen for mobile advertising



Immense opportunities exist in China, especially in the mobile advertising

sector, said a study published by multinational professional services firm

PriceWaterhouseCoopers on Feb 24.



The study into the marketing trends in the United States, Britain, Brazil and

China, found that the Chinese are far more open than inhabitants of other

countries in receiving advertisements and publicity on their mobiles.



"China proposes some interesting, unique and robust opportunities for the

advertiser," Deborah Bothum, the PwC's US Advisory Leader for Entertainment,

Media and Communications, said at the Mobile World Congress, which opened on Feb

24 in Barcelona.



She said the Chinese people are "open to receiving offers."

Lenovo expects profits for Motorola

make the phone producer profitable within four to six quarters without

eliminating jobs, Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing said.

services. But we are stronger in the manufacturing of devices."

Talks to get trade with France 'back on track'



China and France vowed on Feb 24 to revive growth in bilateral trade, which

contracted last year for the first time since 2009.



Bilateral trade fell 2 percent in 2013 to 55.3 billion euros, according to

"We need to push for growth in bilateral trade and rebalance our trade

relations," said Nicole Bricq, the French trade minister.



Bricq made the comments at a news briefing in Paris after meeting with her

Chinese counterpart Gao Hucheng at the Sino-French Trade and Investment

Commission, an annual high-level trade dialogue.



France is trying to boost exports to reduce its trade deficit. It's also

embarked on a "charm offensive" to attract more foreign investment that will

boost its economy.

Energy



China promotes pipeline business opening-up



China has issued a plan to open up its largely monopolized oil and gas

pipelines, in a bid to increase the facilities' efficiency, the energy authority

said on Feb 24.



The National Energy Administration (NEA) said the plan encourages pipeline

operators to open their facilities to each other and to users, including fuel

producers, refiners, sellers and other industrial users, when pipelines have

extra capacity.



Pipeline operators are supposed to provide services including transport,

storage, gasification, liquefaction and compression of crude oil, product oil

and natural gas, at a price agreed upon by the two sides.



The plan involves both onshore and offshore pipelines, and will be supervised by

the NEA.



The construction and operation of China's pipelines are largely dominated by

major state-owned enterprises. In recent years, there has been a mounting call

for the business to be opened up.
