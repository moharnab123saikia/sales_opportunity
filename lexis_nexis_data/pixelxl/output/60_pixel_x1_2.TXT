BEST SMARTPHONES



BEST OVERALL SMARTPHONE



Current Leader: Apple iPhone 5s



The iPhone's reign looks set to continue after Apple's latest, the iPhone 5s,

took an early lead over its closest rival, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. While the

design is unchanged from the previous model, the iPhone 5s with its better

camera, new 64-bit processor and fingerprint scanner, seems to have gone down

well with consumers.

HTC One



LG G2



Samsung Galaxy Note 3



Sony Xperia Z1



BEST ANDROID SMARTPHONE



Current leader: Samsung Galaxy S4



South Korea's Samsung is on course to retain its top spot in the Android

smartphone category with the latest Galaxy S4. Despite good reviews for the HTC

One, Samsung's flagship Galaxy phone appears to be the favourite with consumers

so far. Its top-notch hardware is probably responsible for its success.



The other nominees



Asus PadFone Infinity



HTC One



LG G2



Sony Xperia Z1



BEST PHABLET (ABOVE 5.5 INCHES)



Current leader: Samsung Galaxy Note 3



The phablet category was created by Samsung with the original Galaxy Note. The

latest version refines the formula with improved apps that utilise a stylus and

large screen to its full potential. Its rivals have much catching up to do in

both the hardware and software arenas - not to mention winning the hearts and

minds of consumers.



The other nominees



HTC One Max



LG G Flex



Nokia Lumia 1520



Sony Xperia Z Ultra



BEST SMARTPHONE CAMERA



Current leader: Apple iPhone 5s



The iPhone 5s may not have the raw megapixel count of the Nokia Lumia 1020 or

the low-light performance of the HTC One Max's UltraPixel camera, but it is

apparent from the voting that the iPhone's speed and ease of use is what

consumers value in a smartphone camera.



The other nominees



HTC One Max



Nokia Lumia 1020



Samsung Galaxy Note 3



Sony Xperia Z1



BEST TABLETS



BEST TABLET (ABOVE 9 INCHES)



Apple iPad Air



Apple's flagship tablet received a significant makeover last year. The new iPad

Air is much lighter and has a new 64-bit processor with better performance. More

importantly, Apple still has the edge when it comes to the app ecosystem, which

is a major plus point for consumers when picking a tablet.



The other nominees



Asus Transformer Pad TF701



Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10



Samsung Note 10.1 2014



Sony Xperia Tablet Z



BEST TABLET (BELOW 9 INCHES)



Current leader: Apple iPad mini with Retina display



With the iPad mini getting a crucial Retina display upgrade that keeps it on a

par with its Android rivals, it is not surprising that Apple enjoys a

comfortable lead here. Both the iPad Air and the mini now have identical

hardware, so consumers are getting a very capable tablet.



The other nominees



Google Nexus 7



Lenovo Yoga Tablet 8



LG G Tablet 8.3



Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with LTE



BEST ANDROID TABLET



Current leader: Samsung Note 10.1 2014



So far, Samsung's stylus-toting Note 10.1 is holding its own against the Google

Nexus 7. This may indicate that consumers appreciate the Note 10.1's S Pen

stylus and multitasking capabilities over the cleaner Android interface on the

Nexus. Or simply that they think bigger is better and therefore Samsung's

10-inch Note trumps the Nexus' 7-inch slate.



The other nominees



Asus Transformer Pad TF701



Google Nexus 7



LG G Tablet 8.3



Sony Xperia Tablet Z



BEST WINDOWS TABLET



Current leader: Asus Transformer Book T100



The Asus Transformer Book T100 holds a slight lead over the Microsoft Surface

Pro. It is not hard to see why. This 10.1-inch tablet is affordably priced and

comes with a keyboard dock. Battery life is excellent with its Intel Atom chip.

While the Surface Pro has a more powerful Intel Core processor, its battery

drains too fast for our liking.



The other nominees



Dell Venue Pro 11



Lenovo ThinkPad Helix



Microsoft Surface Pro



Sony Vaio Tap 11



BEST LAPTOPS



BEST GAMING LAPTOP



Current leader: Dell Alienware 18



The Alienware brand is practically synonymous with gaming laptops. Dell's latest

Alienware 18 lives up to its reputation with dual GeForce GTX 780M graphics

chips that should run all the latest games at the highest settings. The laptop

also features a new design with plenty of LEDs that should appeal to gamers.



The other nominees



Aftershock Titan



Asus G750JX



MSI GS70 Stealth



Razer Blade Pro (2013)



BEST THIN AND LIGHT LAPTOP



Current leader: Asus Zenbook UX301LA



With its stunning Gorilla Glass lid, the Asus Zenbook may be the best looking

ultrabook here. It also leads the class in performance with a high-resolution

screen, a graphics chip that is faster than the standard ultrabook, solid-state

drive and a 802.11ac wireless adaptor. Its battery life is not as good as its

competitors' but its other attributes have clearly given it the edge.



The other nominees



Dell XPS 13 (2013)



HP Spectre 13



Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro



Sony Vaio Pro 13



BEST HYBRID LAPTOP



Current leader: Asus Transformer Book Trio



Asus' innovative take on the hybrid is a device with Android and Windows 8

operating systems, a dual OS approach that Intel adopted recently. The Trio is

the only hybrid computer here to have two processors. This design allows for

interesting formulations - including attaching the dock to an external monitor

to function as a stand-alone computer - as well as the more typical tablet and

laptop modes.



The other nominees



Acer Aspire R7



Dell XPS 11



Sony Vaio Duo 13



Sony Vaio Fit 13A



BEST BUSINESS LAPTOP



Current leader: Lenovo ThinkPad X240



The ThinkPad X1 Carbon was the winner of this category in the last Digital Life

Awards and the new ThinkPad X240 looks set to continue this tradition. While it

looks like a typical ThinkPad, the X240 has a more streamlined keyboard and

touchpad design. The keyboard remains as tactile as ever and the hardware has

been upgraded to the latest Intel Haswell chip.



The other nominees



Asus BU400A



Dell Latitude 14 7000 Series



HP EliteBook 840 G1



Toshiba Portege Z30



BEST LAPTOPS



BEST MAINSTREAM LAPTOP



Current leader: Samsung Series 7 Chronos



A battery life of almost nine hours sounds unlikely for a 15-inch mainstream

laptop, but we achieved it with the aluminium-clad Chronos. Despite running on

an older Ivy Bridge Intel processor, this Samsung laptop is still one of the

best in its category with an AMD graphics chip and 8GB RAM.



The other nominees



Acer Aspire V7



Dell Inspiron 15 7000 series



HP Envy 14 TouchSmart



Lenovo Flex 14



BEST CAMERAS



BEST OVERALL CAMERA



Current leader: Olympus OM-D E-M1



This Olympus mirrorless camera is deservedly ahead of the other excellent

nominees in the Best Overall Camera category. Its speed, especially when

autofocusing, is impressive. Its lightweight body looks pleasing, but it is also

able to withstand dust and water splashes. It may not have the highest

megapixels but image quality is still top-notch.



The other nominees



Fujifilm X100S



Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX7



Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 II



Sony a7R



BEST PROSUMER COMPACT CAMERA



Current leader: Canon PowerShot S120



The PowerShot S110 emerged as the Readers' Choice in this category the last

time. The PowerShot S120 model is halfway there. Despite being the most compact

here with its slim metallic body, the S120 packs a 12.1-megapixel image sensor

with optical zoom lens. Another cool feature is a built-in filter that slows

shutter speeds in bright sunlight.



The other nominees



Fujifilm X20



Nikon Coolpix A



Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1R



Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 II



BEST INTERCHANGEABLE LENS CAMERA (MICRO FOUR THIRDS AND BELOW)



Current leader: Olympus OM-D E-M1



This mirrorless camera impressed us with its speedy performance. It powers up

quickly and has almost no shutter lag. Its magnesium alloy body is lighter than

a typical DSLR, but feels sturdy and provides a secure grip. More importantly,

the image quality is excellent. It is no wonder that it is so popular with

readers.



The other nominees



Nikon 1 AW1



Olympus PEN E-P5



Panasonic Lumix DMC-GM1



Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX7



BEST INTERCHANGEABLE LENS CAMERA (APS-C)



Current leader: Canon EOS 70D



A new autofocusing technology is the lynchpin of the Canon EOS 70D. Its Dual

Pixel CMOS AF uses a new image sensor with two light detectors, or photodiodes,

that combine to generate a 20.2-megapixel image. The two can also work

independently in Live View mode to enable faster focusing.



The other nominees



Canon EOS 700D



Fujifilm X-E2



Nikon D7100



Samsung NX300



BEST INTERCHANGEABLE LENS CAMERA (FULL-FRAME)



Current leader: Nikon D610



The Nikon D610 introduces a host of tweaks that improved on the D600 DSLR's auto

white balance and sped up continuous shooting performance. Users will still get

a 24.3-megapixel CMOS sensor with a 39-point autofocusing system. It has two SD

card slots for extra storage.

Leica M (Typ 240)

MOST INNOVATIVE PRODUCT



MOST INNOVATIVE PRODUCT



Current leader: LG Curved OLED TV



Sony's latest PlayStation 4 has got off to a great start with a reported 4.2

million units sold last year. But in the race for the Most Innovative Product,

it plays second fiddle to LG's Curved Oled TV. Its gentle curvature creates an

Imax-like experience, with accurate colour reproduction and deeper blacks and

whites than usual.

Asus Transformer Book Trio



Samsung Galaxy NX



Sony Cyber-shot DSC-QX100

BEST GAMES



BEST OVERALL GAME



Current leader: Grand Theft Auto V (Rockstar Games)



Close to 30 million copies have been sold since it was launched last September,

so it is hardly a surprise to see Grand Theft Auto V doing well among our

readers. With a large open game world to explore and three protagonists to

control, there is plenty to do in this game.



The other nominees



Beyond: Two Souls



Bioshock Infinite



The Last of Us



Tomb Raider



BEST SHOOTER GAME



Current leader: Battlefield 4



The highly anticipated fourth instalment of this popular multiplayer shooter

franchise introduces a new Commander mode which puts a player in charge of the

major strategic decisions for each side. But it is the massive battles involving

air, land and new water-based vehicles that elevate Battlefield 4 above the

competition.



The other nominees



Bioshock Infinite



Crysis 3



Dead Space 3



Metro: Last Light



BEST ACTION ADVENTURE GAME



Current leader: Grand Theft Auto V (Rockstar Games)



Rockstar Games' latest blockbuster leads this category despite strong

competition from rivals such as Assassin's Creed IV and The Last of Us.



While the other games here are excellent, Grand Theft Auto V's scope and

replayability is unmatched and will likely occupy you for weeks, if not months.



The other nominees



Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag



Beyond: Two Souls



The Last of Us



Tomb Raider



BEST SPORTS/RACING GAME



Current leader: Fifa 14



Football's popularity extends into the digital realm. For the second year

running, Fifa leads this category in our Readers' Choice awards.



The latest iteration improves the gameplay with even more realistic player

movement and physics. Stadium atmosphere has been enhanced to change according

to the performance of the teams. It is almost like being there.



The other nominees



F1 2013



Gran Turismo 6



NBA2K14



Need For Speed Rivals



BEST ROLE-PLAYING GAME



Current leader: Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn



Square Enix has done the impossible: turn around a MMO that had flopped horribly

at launch. The reboot, appropriately named A Realm Reborn, is excellent, as its

1.5 million subscribers (at last count) can testify. In addition to being a

contender for the best MMORPG last year, it is one of the best Final Fantasy

games in years.



The other nominees



Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII



Ni No Kuni: Wrath Of The White Witch



Shadowrun Returns



Tales Of Xillia



BEST MADE-IN-SINGAPORE GAMES



CURRENT LEADERS



Brave Frontier (Gumi Asia)



The current front runner in this category, Brave Frontier, is a Japanese-style

RPG that lets you control up to five manga-style heroes to battle hordes of

monsters.



The combat is reminiscent of the turn-based style found in classic Final Fantasy

games, while hero characters can be upgraded by "fusing" them with another.



Monster Blade (Nubee)



Monster slaying is hardly an original premise but we are not quibbling if it is

as entertaining and visually stunning as Monster Blade.



Each monster is aligned to one of five elements that it is strong in but, at the

same time, it is weaker when up against a monster from an opposing element. This

system creates a good amount of depth that requires brains in addition to

knowing the finger swipes to execute a combination of moves.



Puzzle Trooper (Gumi Asia)



The other Gumi Asia game here besides Brave Frontier, Puzzle Trooper takes your

standard match-three puzzle game and infuses it with a cartoon army theme. The

game visuals look very polished and the audio is excellent. With more than



1.2 million downloads since June, this game has certainly amassed quite a

following.

BEST AUDIO



BEST HEADPHONES



Current leader: Sennheiser Momentum On-Ear



In the last Digital Life awards season, Sennheiser topped this category under

Readers' Choice.



This time, the Momentum looks set to win it for Sennheiser again, with a solid

lead over second-placed Audio-Technica. The Momentum's audio reproduction is

excellent with plenty of detail, resulting in a punchy sound that does not go

overboard.



The other nominees



Audio-Technica ATH-ES700



Grado PS500



Marshall Monitor



NAD Viso HP50



BEST EARPHONES



Current leader: Shure SE846



These Shure earphones do not come cheap, but they are definitely worth it. Few

competitors can match their audio quality, especially the deep bass reproduction

and warm vocals. The SE846's transparent design is stunning. The earphones are

bundled with plenty of accessories, including a pair of Kevlar-reinforced

detachable cables.
