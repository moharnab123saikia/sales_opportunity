The handset was launched in the middle of June this year at a price of INR 7,999
and is now made available at INR 6,999.

This handset apes the looks of iPhone 5S in form factor but comes with a very
cheap price tag.

Note that the Google this year partnered with Indian players to launch cheap
Android One in the market with a similar set of hardware and uniform software
platform. These handsets have been launched at INR 6,300 in India, and could
make a better choice.

Lava Mobile's decision seems timely and well thought, since the Iris X1 has a
metallic iPhone like-design (brushed metal looks, but not metal actually) which
gives the phone a different and premium look compared to the Android One that
phones that clearly show off the plastic back panels.

On specs front the Iris X1 have similar specs. Lets us look at the Canvas A1
Android One from Micromax for instance.

This Micromax handset has a 4.5 inch display with a display resolution of 480 x
854 pixel s. This is powered by a 1.3GHz MediaTek MT6582 quad-core processor
which is coupled by Mali 400 MP2 GPU for graphics and 1GB of RAM.

The phone brings a 5-megapixel primary camera on the back side and 2-megapixel
front camera. It has 4GB of internal storage which can be expanded further using
a microSD card.

The Lava Iris X1 is a 4.5 inch display phone with a 854 x 480 pixels IPS display
resolution. This handset comes with full lamination, that should mean it is
resistant against accidental splash of water. The handset also sports an 8
megapixel BSI+ auto-focus camera with 1.4 m pixel size on the back side and 5
megapixel camera on the front side. The phone is powered by the Broadcom
BCM23550 quad-core processor clocked at 1.2 Ghz and carries a RAM of 1 GB.

Another competitor is the Xiaomi RedMi 1S which has been selling like hot cakes
in the Indian market at a price of INR 5,999.

This Chinese phone is a 4.7 inch display phone with HD display, that is 1280 x
720 pixels. The handset is powered by a 1.6 GHz quad-core processor, and had got
1 GB RAM, 64 GB expandable memory. There is, 8 megapixel primary camera with
dual flash and 1.6 megapixel secondary camera in the Phone. The handset is
exclusively available at Flipkart via flash sales that come up in 7-10 days.

The third competitor with be the Apple iPhone 5S and Galaxy Alpha this year.
With Apple now shifting its design with a more rounded corners and edges this
year in the new Iphone 6 (different from the last years' iPhone 5S which had a
premium looks), Lava Iris X1 will be a cheap alternative against the iPhone 5S
this year.

Also the Galaxy Alpha which will launch in India on the 27th which has looks
like the iPhone 5S, Lava's pitching of Iris X1 at lower price seems justified.

Lava yesterday announced that it will cut the price of its Iris X1 for the
Indian market. The handset is today available for purchase in Flipkart and on
eBay.
