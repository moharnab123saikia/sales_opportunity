New Delhi, Sept. 30 -- Internet search giant Google on Tuesday launched a new

tablet named Pixel C priced at USD 499 to compete with products like the Apple

iPad Pro and the Microsoft Surface.



The 10.2-inch tablet, which comes with a magnetic keyboard, will run on the

latest Android operating system Marshmallow. The new C will have a screen

resolution of 2650 x 1800 pixels and a pixel density of 380 ppi (pixels per

inch). It will support 500 nits of brightness.



In terms of processing power, the C will run a Nvidia X1 quad-core processor

along with a 3 GB RAM unit. "We wanted to design a product that would give a

great experience of touch and type and hence we designed the Pixel C," said a

Google spokesperson.



The magnetic keyboard, which will be available as an accesory for $149, connects

to the tablet via Bluetooth. Google said that the keyboard can go without charge

for two months. Interestingly, the keyboard which works as a front cover for the

tablet charges from its battery.



Earlier, Apple had launched a 13-inch tablet with a keyboard and a stylus to

compete with other existing tablets in the market especially the Microsoft

Surface which claims to give laptop-like productivity on the go.
