Whether you are going abroad or just recharging your batteries at home during

the upcoming school holidays, take some time to do some bargain hunting at the

inaugural SG Tech Show 2014.



It covers 12,000 sq m of exhibition area, or the size of slightly more than two

football fields, so you can burn off some calories walking around to find the

gadgets of your dreams.



The organisers expect about 350,000 visitors and project sales of $25 million

over the four days of the show. The event is organised by Exhibits Inc, a

subsidiary of Singapore Press Holdings, which brings you the IT Show, Comex, as

well as the Food & Beverage Fair.



The SG Tech Show 2014 offers not only bargains, but also a whole new learning

experience.



Said Exhibits Inc's general manager Melvin Koh: "We want to create a different

shopping experience as compared with other shows. Consumers can buy not only

gadgets, but also be educated about the new technologies and how to integrate

them into their lifestyle."



The centrepiece of this show will be EpiLife's booth by tech premium reseller

EpiCentre. Taking up almost 1,000 sq m, it is the biggest booth ever in a local

technology fair, according to Exhibits Inc.



"We just relaunched our online store, EpiLife.com, and are in the midst of

rebranding our EpiLife stores. SG Tech Show 2014 gives us a great opportunity to

showcase these new changes," said Ms Evelyn Chua, EpiCentre's head of operations

and business development.



The EpiLife booth comprises four experience zones: EpiHome, EpiWarrior,

EpiFitness and EpiEntertainment. Each zone showcases smart technologies which

can be used at home, on the road, when exercising or during recreation time.



"The four EpiExperience zones bring digital solutions to all aspects of today's

digital lifestyle with a suite of cool gadgets and accessories," said Ms Chua.



Notable events at this year's show include Casio's launch of its flagship

prosumer compact camera, Exilim EX-100. This 12.1-megapixel camera has a

stunning 10.7x optical zoom lens with constant f/2.8 aperture.



In addition, there are some irresistible deals, such as a limited number of the

Samsung Galaxy Note 3 selling at $588 (usual price $898) each or a rice cooker

for $8 (usual price $49).



So, are you ready for the show? Put on your most comfortable footwear and get

ready to prowl the show floor for some serious bargain hunting.
