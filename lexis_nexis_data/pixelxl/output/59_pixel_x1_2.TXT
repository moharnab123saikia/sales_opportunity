EMERGING LEGAL ISSUES IN THE DIGITAL AGE: ARTICLE & ESSAY: Judicial Notice and

the Internet: The Legal Reasoning and Technical Basis for Taking Judicial Notice

of the Fact that Internet Pages Display from the Top-Left-Hand Corner Out

LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:

 ... In other words, Internet programming protocol facts - such as the fact that

the Internet will always display from the upper-left-hand corner out - are

subject to judicial notice because they can be easily and reliably verified.

... Web-Based Image Distribution and Display One of the major innovative aspects

of the Internet is that it offers standardized interfaces for viewing images and

texts through standard protocols.  ... Internet content is generally stored in

arrays.  ... However, absent a lack of capacity, if an Internet user reads a

notice that clearly states that in exchange for the right to access and use a

particular Internet site, the user must agree to a particular set of terms and

conditions in order to access and use a particular Internet site, and, after

reading such a notice, the reader accesses and uses the Internet site, a court

would likely find mutual assent and consideration.  ... Sixth, a jury could be

instructed that all Internet communications require one or more third-party

computers as part of the transfer process, and that Internet programming

protocols do not require said third-party computers to erase data that passes

through them.

   I. Introduction



 The American judicial system requires that each fact in a case be proven

through formal presentation. Most Internet transactions involve acts completed

by people in the presence of devices rather than in the presence of other

people. This lack of other people's presence promotes confusion during

litigation around a single fundamental fact - what a participant to an Internet

transaction accessed.



   Legislatures throughout the United States have reduced the judicial system

burden by allowing every level of court to recognize facts that constitute

common knowledge without requiring proof from the parties - known as "judicial

notice." As technology has evolved, so has the scope of judicial notice. In

order to improve court efficiency and the likelihood of a meritorious decision,

judicial notice should include the fact that what a participant to an Internet

transaction accessed is not subject to reasonable dispute.



   Internet use and related litigation are growing. n1 By taking judicial notice

n2 of Internet content, n3 courts promote judicial convenience and  [*226]

economy. n4 Courts have an opportunity to promote efficiency by taking judicial

notice of certain Internet-related facts. This Article supplies the legal and

technical justifications for such judicial notice.



   In particular, this Article will provide the technical reasons for taking

judicial notice of the fact that the Internet will always display the

upper-left-hand corner of each page that is requested by a user. Courts taking

such notice will be able to dispense with the time and effort necessary to

demonstrate that an Internet site user viewed certain Internet content.



   This Article is composed of four parts. Part II describes the doctrine of

judicial notice and its significance to litigation involving the Internet. Part

III establishes that a court may take notice of Internet programming protocol

because a court can establish that such protocol information is correct without

resorting to evidentiary proof. Part III also provides the technical reason for

the Internet to display websites from the upper-left-hand corner out. Next, Part

IV describes the potential significance of taking judicial notice of

upper-left-hand corner display, especially with regards to a "terms of use"

agreement icon. Finally, Part V identifies additional Internet operational facts

that may merit judicial notice.



[*227]



   II. The Doctrine of Judicial Notice



 Judicial notice is the process by which the finder of fact at a trial accepts

certain facts as true without the necessity of a formal proof proceeding. It is

a substitute for evidence. Judicial notice is rooted in the knowledge that

certain factual findings are not subject to sensible debate and thus may be

properly resolved by the presentation of appropriate evidence to the finder of

fact at trial. As more people use the Internet, the features of the Internet

will become increasingly familiar to those involved in the judicial process,

and, as a result, such features will be generally known and thereby subject to

judicial notice.



   Section A of this Part describes the process by which a court takes judicial

notice. Section B explains the practical implications of taking judicial notice.

Finally, this Part suggests that the doctrine of judicial notice can and should

be applied to Internet programming protocols.



   A. How Judicial Notice Works



 When a court takes judicial notice of a fact, it dispenses with formal proof,

which is the usual method of establishing facts at trial. A court's ability to

take judicial notice of a fact is limited; however, judicial notice may cover

the issues of who did what, where, when, how, and with what motive or intent,

and will typically relate to the parties, their activities, their properties,

and their businesses. n5



   The Federal Rules of Evidence ("FRE") recognize judicial notice based on the

concept of verifiable certainty. FRE 201 governs judicial notice in federal

practice. In particular, FRE 201(b) reads: "The court may judicially notice a

fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally

known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be

accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably

be questioned." n6



   Judicial notice can be taken of either a legislative fact or an adjudicative

fact. n7 Adjudicative facts are facts related to a particular case. These facts

concern the issues of who did what, where, when, and how, and they are

ordinarily resolved by the finder of fact at trial. Adjudicative facts normally

are related to the parties; their transactions; and their assets, properties,

and  [*228]  businesses. n8 Legislative facts, however, are related to legal

reasoning and the lawmaking process. Internet programming protocol, such as

having the Internet always display the upper-left-hand corner of each page

requested by an Internet user, is an adjudicative fact. Regarding adjudicative

facts, FRE 201 provides that courts may only take judicial notice of

adjudicative facts that are "not subject to reasonable dispute." n9



   A court may take judicial notice in both civil and criminal cases. In civil

cases, a court will instruct the jury to accept as an irrefutable fact anything

that the judge has judicially noticed. In criminal cases, the court can only

instruct the jury that it may accept as fact findings of judicially-noticed

facts. n10 Because Internet transactions have resulted in both civil and

criminal cases, taking judicial notice of Internet programming protocol may

prove useful to both courts and litigants.



   Just as jurors have the right to rely on their common knowledge, a court has

the right to take judicial notice of subjects of common knowledge. n11 As the

use of the Internet expands, n12 so presumably has the knowledge of Internet

programming protocol facts.



   B. The Purpose of Judicial Notice



 The purpose of taking judicial notice is to allow for the conservation of

resources n13: a short-cut designed to reduce the court's work. n14 Because

taking judicial notice is a means of conserving scarce judicial resources, a

court may do so upon its own motion. By doing so, a court may swiftly move

[*229]  the trial along by relieving itself of unnecessary burdens. n15 Taking

judicial notice is also a means of conserving a litigating party's resources.

Hence, a court must take judicial notice of a fact when requested to do so by a

party who supplies the obligatory information n16 and when the other party has

had an opportunity to oppose the taking of judicial notice. n17 In either case,

taking judicial notice of Internet programming protocol, such as the protocol

that forces the Internet to display the upper-left-hand corner of content pages

requested by an Internet user, will enable the conservation of resources.



   Courts properly take judicial notice of facts that are not objectionable to a

reasonable person. n18 By doing so, courts may dispense with the usual method of

establishing adjudicative facts through the introduction of evidence. Ordinarily

consisting of the testimony of witnesses, establishing adjudicative facts is

both time-and asset-consuming for the courts and the parties involved in the

litigation. The appropriate introduction of a fact via judicial notice is not as

time-and asset-consuming. From a trial attorney's perspective, the presentation

of live expert testimony is expensive when compared to the use of judicial

notice. Rather than spending thousands of dollars for live expert testimony, an

attorney typically must pay an expert only a few hundred dollars to prepare an

affidavit supporting judicial notice.



   Courts have judicially noticed propositions about a wide range of technical

topics. Such propositions need not be matters of common knowledge, nor must the

judge who takes judicial notice of a fact have personal knowledge of such facts,

n19 provided that the facts can be verified to a certainty by reference to

competent authoritative sources. n20 The fact that most, if not virtually all,

Internet access terminals display Internet sites from the upper-left-hand corner

out is easily perceptible to even the most casual observer. Taking judicial

notice of this fact would relieve the court of hearing evidence of what an

Internet user did or did not receive as a result of the request.



   III. A Court May Take Notice of Internet Programming Protocols



 Internet programming protocol facts, if relevant to a particular matter, may

qualify for judicial notice because such information will facilitate a  [*230]

judicially-empowered fact finder. n21 The assumption underlying FRE 201's

judicial notice conventions is that certain information does not need to be

proven by the introduction of evidence at trial. Thus, Rule 201 allows a court

to establish that the information is relevant and valid without resorting to

evidentiary proof n22 and, in doing so, allows justice to be achieved in a more

economical fashion. n23 Internet programming protocols are the type of evidence

of which a court could take judicial notice.



   Section A of this Part establishes why Internet programming protocols are

necessary and why following or failing to follow these protocols determines

without reasonable dispute the user's ability to access the Internet. Section B

provides that Internet programming protocols can be judicially noticed because

they are either generally known or readily verifiable. Section C explains the

technical basis for verifying that Internet pages display from the

upper-left-hand corner out.



   A. Reasoning for Internet Programming Protocols



 When one looks at a traditional page of text, the flow of text in a paragraph

begins on the upper-left-hand side of a page and moves toward the right.

Historically, this innovation has been attributed to right-handed cuneiform

scribes who observed that writing on clay tablets was less smudged when one

moved from left to right. n24 When text wraps, the new line begins below the

previous one at the left side of the page. For English readers, it is so natural

that one does not even notice these conventions. However, numerous studies have

found that aligning English text to the right results in decreased readability

and comprehension. n25



   The same cannot be said of Internet content displayed on computer screens.

Like traditional text, the flow of text in a paragraph begins in the upper-left

hand and moves toward the right. Unlike traditional text, however,  [*231]  the

text wraps beyond the end of the computer display, and the new line, which

begins below the previous one at the left side of the page, may not make sense

because the computer has failed to display all of the text from the end of the

line above it. n26



   The fact that Internet programming protocols force Internet sites to display

content from the upper-left-hand corner out is a significant problem for much of

the world. Both Japanese and Chinese books and magazines lay out printed text

vertically. The text begins at the top-right corner of the page and flows

downward, wrapping the next line to the top of the page and to the left of the

previous line. Newspaper headlines, for example, run down the right side of the

page. Despite the traditional layout of printed material, both Japanese and

Chinese Internet sites must be designed to display content from the

upper-left-hand corner out because Internet programming protocols cannot handle

displaying content from the upper-right-hand corner out. n27



   These protocols that force Internet sites to display content from the

upper-left-hand corner, as well as other Internet programming protocols, allow

the Internet to exist. Unless all Internet users agree to certain programming

protocols, the Internet would cease to function. Because "the Internet is an

international network of interconnected computers[,]" n28 communication on the

Internet requires adherence to common technical protocols. Thus, these common

technical protocols are a set of agreed-upon "rules" of communication between

and among computers networked into the Internet.



   At the Internet's foundation is the logical layer, which consists of two

standard sets of rules: namely, the Transmission Control Protocol ("TCP") and

the Internet Protocol ("IP") n29 - commonly known together as TCP/IP. Together,

these two sets of rules define the nature of Internet communications.



   TCP repackages each Internet communication into messages suitable for digital

communication, assigns a number to each message it creates, and prepares a check

sum so that the receiving computer can check the integrity of the communication.

Additionally, it makes available detailed information necessary for the

reassembly of the message into the proper sequence by the receiving computer and

orders the resending of any lost or damaged messages. In short, all Internet

communications rely on TCP to communicate  [*232]  a message. Thus, the Internet

programming protocols supply the output for each message with the same input.



   The IP adds computer instructions to each message prepared by the TCP. These

instructions dictate the routing of messages among Internet computers. Among

other computer instructions added to TCP messages by the IP, it provides the

Internet address of the sending computer and the Internet address of the

destination computer. n30 Because all Internet communications follow a set of

rules, software programs known as "parsers" use these Internet rules to convert

incoming compressed messages into a fixed format.



   Additionally, the Internet is composed of a wide variety of display devices;

thus, the Internet graphic software must be device independent. Therefore,

Internet access devices share baseline specifications. Among other

specifications are those related to graphical display interfaces such as the

ones set forth by The American National Standards Institute, n31 which calls for

the use of common defaults.



   Failing to follow each and every one of the foregoing protocols results in a

potential Internet user's inability to access or use the Internet. Conversely,

potential Internet users who execute the foregoing protocols are allowed to

access or use the Internet. Consequently, either following or failing to follow

said protocols will, without reasonable dispute, determine whether the user can

access the Internet.



   B. Judicial Notice Can Be Taken of Internet Protocols



 Courts have judicially noticed propositions about a wide range of technological

subject matters. Although such propositions in these areas are hardly matters of

common knowledge, the modern scope of judicial notice is not limited to such

matters. The fact that most, if not virtually all, Internet access terminals

display Internet sites from the upper-left-hand corner out is well-known. This

fact is widely recognized in the e-commerce marketplace. Website providers will

promise to those who pay a premium price that they will get premium placement on

the brander's website, such as being in the upper-left-hand corner. n32



   Furthermore, when an Internet site's "terms of use" agreement appears in the

upper-left-hand corner of an Internet page, FRE 201 may be triggered to

determine whether judicial notice should be taken of the Internet user's

awareness of the "terms of use" agreement. A court may take notice of Internet

programming protocol because such protocol meets the requirements  [*233]  for

judicial notice of an adjudicative fact. For judicial notice to be embraced by

the court, however, the Internet programming protocol must be either generally

known or readily verifiable. n33



   First, Internet programming protocol facts are generally known throughout the

United States (and thus within the territorial jurisdiction of any trial court).

Second, Internet programming protocol facts can be readily verified by resorting

to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. Thus, under FRE 201,

there are two different ways that Internet programming protocol facts may be

found to be indisputable adjudicative facts subject to judicial notice.



   Under the first test, Internet programming protocol facts are experienced

first-hand by most people. Millions of people use the Internet every day, and

each of those people have the personal, first-hand experience of seeing that the

Internet will always display the upper-left-hand corner of each page that they

requested. This fact is so well known that it is a waste of judicial resources

to require proof. As to this fact, reasonably knowledgeable people cannot

disagree. n34 Although it could be argued that some people would not know about

Internet programming protocol facts, it is not required that said facts be

universally known. Courts may take judicial notice of facts generally known

within its territorial jurisdiction. n35



   Under the second test, Internet programming protocol facts can be judicially

noticed because they are readily verifiable through sources whose reliability

cannot reasonably be questioned. Judicial notice of these facts is appropriate

even if it is not generally known that the manner in which the Internet

functions is due to Internet programming protocols. In other words, Internet

programming protocol facts - such as the fact that the Internet will always

display from the upper-left-hand corner out - are subject to judicial notice

because they can be easily and reliably verified. n36 The next Part of this

Article details reliable sources that may be used to verify that the Internet

will always display Internet pages from the upper-left-hand corner out.



[*234]



   C. The Technical Basis for Verifying that Internet Pages Display From the

Upper-Left-Hand Corner Out



 Verifying that the Internet pages display from the upper-left-hand corner out

requires the understanding of three technological concepts. Section 1 of this

Part introduces Hypertext Markup Language ("HTML"), the standard language for

displaying webpages. Section 2 discusses web-based image displays, including the

standard protocols for displaying Internet pages from the upper left hand corner

out. Finally, Section 3 addresses the programming basis for opening Internet

pages from upper-left-hand corner out.



   1. Web-Based Image Distribution and Display



 One of the major innovative aspects of the Internet is that it offers

standardized interfaces for viewing images and texts through standard protocols.

As previously noted, Internet access and use are enabled by complying with a set

of protocols. Consequently, failure to use said interfaces will result in a lack

of Internet access. Such failure is not subject to reasonable dispute and, as a

result, should be subject to judicial notice.



   Most documents on the web are stored and transmitted in HTML. HTML is a

simple language well suited for hypertext, multimedia, and the display of small

and reasonably-simple documents. HTML is based on standard generalized markup

language ("SGML"), an international organization for standardization ("ISO")

standard system for defining and using document formats. However, HTML has some

limitations on extensibility, structure, and validation. n37



   2. Web-Based Image Display



 Currently, most web browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla

Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple's Safari, support Joint Photo-graphic Experts

Group ("JPEG," 24 bits for color images) or Graphics Interchange Format ("GIF,"

8 bits) image rendering. These browsers also support text display mode.

Web-based imaging display, like web-based distribution, relies on the fact that

Internet access and use are enabled by complying with a set of protocols.

Failure to use said interfaces will result in a lack of Internet access. Such

failure is not subject to reasonable dispute and, consequently, should be

subject to judicial notice.



   Text display mode is the visual display equivalent of printing. In fact, the

most universally accepted programming command for displaying text on a computer

terminal is PRINT followed by two sets of quotation marks (i.e.,  [*235]  PRINT

""). n38 When the program runs, the PRINT statement tells the computer to print

out everything between the two quotation marks on each line, exactly as it is

shown in the program. As a computer hardware default, the first mark displayed

will be in the upper-left-hand corner of the screen. To change this default, the

LOCATE computer command is most typically used. The format of the LOCATE command

is LOCATE [row, column], where row is the numerical position of the row starting

point (normally 1 through 25, with 1 being the top row) and where column is the

numerical position of the column starting point (normally 1 through 80, with 1

being the left-most column).



   Nearly all graphic display mode software operates in a similar fashion. For

example, medium-resolution displays today are commonly 1024 by 768 pixels;

low-resolution displays are 800 by 600 pixels; and minimum-resolution displays

are 320 by 200 pixels, accessible even on a cell phone or a hypothetical display

used by the Text Display mode. If the screen used in medium resolution graphics

mode is expressed in terms of an X-and Y-axis, then X corresponds to the columns

and Y to the rows. The top left point on the screen is (0,0) and the bottom

right is (319,199). X increases as one moves to the right across the screen, and

Y increases as one moves down.



   As in the case of the Text Display mode, the default for the starting point

for points, lines, and other shapes for medium resolution graphics mode is the

top left point on the screen. It should be noted that this default is also the

starting point for the positioning of the screen cursor.



   Internet content is generally stored in arrays. An array is a structured

arrangement of items of computerized data in tabular form for easy reference.

For example, an array of even numbers might be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, stored in

such a way as to result in the display of "2" first when the array is called for

use by a computer program, "4" next when the array is called again, and so on.

It should be noted that an array also stores information concerning the shape of

the array. Thus, an array of even numbers may be stored as:



   2 4 6 8 10 12



   or



   2 4 6



   8 10 12.



   The GET command stores the shape of the array. The format for a GET command

is usually GET (X1,Y1) - (X2,Y2), [Array Name] where X1, Y1 are the x and y

coordinates of the top left corner of the rectangle that contains the shape of

the array; X2, Y1 are the x and y coordinates of the bottom right of the shape

of the array; and the Array Name is the computer location of the content of the

array.



    [*236]  The default for X1, Y1 - the x-and y-coordinates of the top-left

corner of the rectangle that contains the shape of the array - is (0,0), which

is the upper-left-hand corner of the display screen. Thus, it is normal for the

content of the array to be displayed starting in the upper-left-hand corner of

the area designed to accept the array content.



   The PUT statement displays on a computer screen the shape stored in the array

by the GET command. Once a shape is in the array, it can be PUT at any location

on the computer display screen. The format for PUT statements is typically PUT (

X1,Y1), [Array Name], where X1 and Y1 are the x-and y-coordinates of the screen

location to put the upper-left corner of the array shape. The default for the

PUT starting coordinates is (0,0), which is the upper-left-hand corner of the

display.



   3. Programming Basis for Opening Internet Pages from Upper-Left Corner Out



 As noted above, HTML is the language of internet webpage transmission. n39 HTML

is a markup/structured document language n40 and is a subset of the "SGML, the

Standard Generalized Markup Language, . + . + . an international standard (ISO

8879) that defines a syntax for the character representation of structured

information." n41 HTML describes a page from the top down. n42 From a

programmer's perspective, an Internet page is built as follows:







   <HTML>







<Head>







<Title>This is my webpage</Title>







</Head>







<Body>







<p>First paragraph</p>







<p>Second paragraph</p>







</Body>







</HTML>



The HTML rendering engines interpret HTML by opening the document from the top

(in a linear manner). n43 Thus, Internet pages open from the upper-left-  [*237]

hand corner out because in modern operating systems (Windows, n44 Linux, UNIX,

n45 and Java n46), the coordinate system is defined as starting in the top-left

corner.



    [*238]  As a result, it is generally known and capable of accurate and ready

determination by resorting to reliable sources that Internet pages open from the

upper-left-hand corner out. The extent of the display of any particular Internet

page requested by an Internet user, however, depends upon the device on which

the Internet page is being displayed.



   IV. Potential Significance of Judicial Notice of the Fact that the Internet

Displays the Upper-Left Corner of Pages Requested by an Internet User



 Consumers and businesses are adopting and taking advantage of various forms of

Internet-related notices, particularly "terms of use" agreements, which

potentially change the relationship between an Internet site owner and its users

from public to private law. n47



   The enforceability of a "terms of use" agreement, however, will depend upon

whether it meets the classic requirements of a binding contract: (1) parties

capable of contracting n48; (2) mutual assent n49; and (3) consideration. n50

[*239]  If an Internet user is not capable of contracting due to lack of

capacity, a "terms of use" agreement will not be enforced. However, absent a

lack of capacity, if an Internet user reads a notice that clearly states that in

exchange for the right to access and use a particular Internet site, the user

must agree to a particular set of terms and conditions in order to access and

use a particular Internet site, and, after reading such a notice, the reader

accesses and uses the Internet site, a court would likely find mutual assent and

consideration. This assertion is supported by the enforceability of

"shrink-wrap" agreements. n51



   "Terms of use" agreements are arguably more enforceable than "shrink-wrap"

agreements when it can be shown that the user has advance notice of the

existence of the "terms of use" agreement. For example, advance notice could be

shown if the Internet site required a potential Internet user to take certain

action that demonstrated the Internet user's awareness of the "terms of use"

agreement. Such action could include clicking on an "I agree" icon as part of a

registration process to affirmatively manifest assent.



   In the past it was argued that a site that had a "terms of use" agreement was

not enforceable if it did not require an affirmative manifestation of assent.

Without such affirmative manifestation of assent, such as "clicking" on an "I

agree" icon, there was no evidence that the Internet user had notice of the

"terms of use" agreement. n52 Such an argument, however, could not presently be

made if the court took judicial notice of the fact that the Internet will always

display the upper-left-hand corner of each page that is requested by a user and

if the parties to the litigation stipulate that the "terms of use" agreement was

in the upper-left-hand corner of the page requested by the user.



   It should also be noted that "neither real nor apparent intention that a

promise be legally binding is essential to the formation of a contract[.]" n53

Thus, the fact that an Internet user who saw the "terms of use" agreement on his

computer after requesting a particular Internet page had no intention of giving

a legal promise to abide by the agreement does not void his assent to be bound

by the terms. Additionally, a "terms of use" agreement must be capable of being

given an exact meaning, and all the performances to be rendered must be certain.

Otherwise, the "terms of use" agreement will not be enforced. n54



    [*240]  In order for a litigating party to avail itself of the advantages

afforded by posting "terms of use" agreements, it first must demonstrate to the

trial fact finder that its adversary was aware of such agreements. Typically,

this awareness is proven by presenting Internet traffic and communication data,

as well as expert testimony. However, the necessity of such formal proof can be

rendered unnecessary through the application of judicial notice. n55



   Judicial notice should be taken of an Internet user's awareness of a

particular Internet site's "terms of use" agreement when that agreement's icon

appears in the upper-left-hand corner of the Internet page. Such treatment is

justified by: (1) the defaults built into computer graphic software that almost

universally use the upper-left-hand corner as a starting reference point; (2)

the Internet programming protocol that requires Internet users to adhere to a

set of technical rules about how information should be transmitted and received

by computers; and (3) the courts' standards for the use of judicial notice.



   The U.S. Supreme Court has taken judicial notice of the fact that billboards,

street car signs, placards, and such, unlike newspaper and magazine

advertisements, are in a class by themselves because they "thrust" their message

on the viewer. n56 The Court found that billboards, street car signs, and

placards deprive the viewer of any real choice over whether to receive the

message.



   In comparison, the upper-left-hand corner of an Internet page is like a

billboard, a street car sign, or a placard because it is constantly before the

eyes of observers without the exercise of choice or volition on the part of the

viewer. Internet users have no choice but to view the upper-left-hand corner of

any page they electronically request from the Internet. Although a viewer may

move his eyes from billboard to billboard or move from Internet page to Internet

page, the content of both the billboard and the upper-left-hand corner of any

Internet page are before him regardless of choice or volition.



   In the case of newspapers and magazines, the viewer must seek and find the

advertisement. Similarly, in the case of a television or radio, advertisements

can be turned off. In the case of requesting an Internet page, however, once the

Internet request is made, the Internet will always display the upper-left-hand

corner of the requested page. Therefore, the user need not seek the

upper-left-hand corner of a webpage, nor is the Internet user able to turn it

off. Consequently, courts should treat the upper-left-hand corner of any page

like a billboard or street car sign.



    [*241]  If a court treated the upper-left-hand corner of an Internet page

like a billboard or street car sign and took judicial notice that a particular

Internet user's computer displayed a "terms of use" icon in that corner, then

the Internet site's "terms of use" agreement would be binding upon the user in

accordance with the findings of Carnival Cruise Lines v. Shute. n57 In Carnival

Cruise Lines, a Washington resident was injured in international waters off the

coast of Mexico and filed an action in the U.S. District Court of Washington.

n58 The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of a personal injury claim filed

in Washington because the plaintiff failed to abide by a note on the ticket that

referred her to a contractually-stipulated Florida forum. n59



   In particular, the face of each ticket, in its lower-left-hand corner,

contained this admonition:







   " "SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT ON LAST PAGES IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ

CONTRACT - ON LAST PAGES 1, 2, 3' App. 15." n60



 Appearing on the first contract page was the following:







   TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PASSAGE CONTRACT TICKET







....







3. (a) The acceptance of this ticket by the person or persons named hereon as

passengers shall be deemed to be an acceptance and agreement by each of them of

all of the terms and conditions of this Passage Contract Ticket.







....







8. It is agreed by and between the passenger and the Carrier that all disputes

and matters whatsoever arising under, in connection with or incident to this

Contract shall be litigated, if at all, in and before a Court located in the

State of Florida, U.S.A., to the exclusion of the Courts of any other state or

country. n61



 The rationale in Carnival Cruise Lines may be used in combination with judicial

notice to conclude that an Internet user is aware of a particular Internet

site's "terms of use" agreement when such site's "terms of use" agreement icon

appeared in the upper-left-hand corner of an Internet page. Such a combination

could save a significant amount of court resources.



   A two-step process is required to achieve these desired court resource

savings. First, a court would instruct the jury that a particular Internet

user's computer displayed a "terms of use" icon after the court has taken

judicial notice of the fact that the Internet will always display the

upper-left-hand corner of a webpage and that the icon was in the upper-left-hand

corner of the page. Next, relying on Carnival Cruise Lines, the jury would be

instructed that those with notice of a "terms of use" agreement are obligated to

abide by it whether they chose to read it or not, unless the agreement itself is

unlawful.



[*242]



   V. Other Internet-Related Facts that May Merit Judicial Notice



 In addition to taking judicial notice of the upper-left-hand corner of an

Internet page, there are other Internet-related facts that merit judicial

notice. Judicial notice of the following facts should be considered: (1) email

messages are copied by third-party computers during transmission; (2) all

Internet content is digital; (3) the Internet operates at near light speed,

which on a planet this size amounts to near real-time; (4) webpages may be

viewed on any operational computer with an Internet connection and a web

browser; (5) the Internet has the ability to make software and data files

available for downloading; (6) the Internet has no irreplaceable central

control, administration, or authority; and (7) the United States controls domain

name transfers. n62



   The significance of taking judicial notice of such Internet facts varies. The

ability to instruct a lay jury regarding technical Internet facts can be

especially significant. Consider the following six scenarios in which certain

Internet facts need not to be proven to a jury.



   First, a jury could be instructed that the Internet is able to adapt itself

almost instantaneously to damages or outages to individual sections of the

Internet. n63 This fact means that the loss of individual computers and networks

does not affect the Internet's overall flexibility, accuracy, or speed. If a

court takes judicial notice of this fact, then it need not be proven that the

loss of any individual computer did not affect the Internet's overall

performance.



   Second, a jury could be instructed that Internet communications travel at

near light speed of approximately 186,000 miles per second. This fact means that

even if two computers are half a world apart, they will only experience a tenth

of a second in communications delay. If a court takes judicial notice of this

fact, then it need not be proven that Internet communications are nearly real

time.



   Third, a jury could be instructed that the Internet is based on a common

standard - the TCP/IP network protocol. This fact means that the Internet

provides all computers with access to the network with the same technical

interface and capabilities. If a court takes judicial notice of this fact, then

it need not be proven that the Internet provides universal access, giving the

same powerful capabilities to everyone with access to the network no matter

where they are.



    [*243]  Fourth, a jury could be instructed that the Internet is based on

digital data and that it uses TCP. n64 This fact means that Internet

communications cannot be changed or become distorted over time or in

transmissions between sites. If a court takes judicial notice of this fact, then

it need not be proven that a website does not age and become fuzzy or garbled

over time, and that the characters in an email are not transposed or mixed up

when they are sent over long distances.



   Fifth, a jury could be instructed that all email communications use the

standard programming protocol, TCP/IP, upon which inter-computer communications

are based. This fact means that all emails have TCP error control information;

when an email is sent, "TCP receives the packets and checks for errors[, and

w]hen an error occurs, TCP asks for the particular packet to be re-sent." n65 If

a court takes judicial notice of this fact, then it need not be proven that the

email message received was error-free. Therefore, an email received has the same

content as the email that was sent. Similarly, because all email communications

use the TCP/IP standard upon which inter-computer communications are based, all

emails contain embedded data that is affixed to the document at its creation and

at subsequent times when handled by other computers that promoted its travel. If

a court takes judicial notice of embedded data, then it need not be proven that

the embedded data exists, thus allowing the court to focus directly on the

meaning of that data, such as the identity of the author, the creation date, and

the data concerning authenticity. n66



   Sixth, a jury could be instructed that all Internet communications require

one or more third-party computers as part of the transfer process, and that

Internet programming protocols do not require said third-party computers to

erase data that passes through them. n67 These facts mean that email and

requested Internet webpage files remain within the transfer computers as

residual data on existing "free space." n68 If a court takes judicial notice of

these facts, then it need not be proven that the residual data exists, thus

allowing the court to focus directly on the meaning of that data, such as the

content of the Internet communication, the identity of the author, the creation

date, and the data concerning authenticity.



[*244]



   VI. Conclusion



 The fact that Internet pages open from the upper-left-hand corner out is

capable of accurate and ready determination by resorting to sources whose

accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. Furthermore, there are other

Internet-related facts that merit judicial notice. Because taking judicial

notice will save judicial resources and save litigants time and effort, courts

should take judicial notice of these Internet programming protocols.

   Internet-related litigation has nearly doubled in the past four years by one

measure. Using the LexisNexis legal research database, only 735 federal cases

from January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2001, contained "Internet" in their head

note section. Comparatively, 1,402 federal cases from January 1, 2004, to

January 1, 2005, contained "Internet" in their head note section.











n2.  The term "judicial notice" is defined as "the cognizance of certain facts

which a judge under rules of legal procedure or otherwise may properly take or

act upon without proof because they are already known to him or because of that

knowledge which a judge has, or is assumed to have by virtue of his office."

Ballentine's Law Dictionary 685 (3d ed. 1969).











n3.  Courts have regularly taken judicial notice of Internet information. As

with traditional publications, courts are most willing to take judicial notice

of information found on government websites. In United States v. Bervaldi, the

court took judicial notice of the time of sunrise, found on the website of the

U.S. Naval Observatory. 226 F.3d 1256, 1266 n.9 (11th Cir. 2000). In Levan v.

Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., the court took notice of the prime interest rate which

it found on the Federal Reserve Board website. 190 F.3d 1230, 1235 n.12 (11th

Cir. 1999). Judicial notice of mileage was taken using the MapQuest site in In

re Extradition of Gonzalez. 52 F. Supp. 2d 725, 731 n.12 (W.D. La. 1999).

Judicial notice was taken of information regarding a bank's ownership from the

bank's website in Laborers' Pension Fund v. Blackmore Sewer Construction, Inc.,

298 F.3d 600, 607 (7th Cir. 2002).











n4.  A court may promote convenience and economy by taking judicial notice of a

fact and dispensing with formal proofs, which is the usual method of

establishing facts at trial. The obvious benefit of such action is associated

with reducing both parties' costs and reducing the need for the court's time if

the court establishes a fact in an adversarial proceeding and dispenses with

formal proof when a matter is not really disputable because there is no real

issue of fact.

   Pew Internet Project data from June 2004 show that use of search engines on a

typical day has risen from 30% to 41% of the internet-using population, which

itself has grown in the past year. This means that the number of those using

search engines on an average day jumped from roughly 38 million in June 2004 to

about 59 million in September 2005 - an increase of about 55%. comScore data,

which are derived from a different methodology, show that from September 2004 to

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145205(the=vs.85).aspx

. The Windows development center explains,







   The coordinate system for a window is based on the coordinate system of the

display device. The basic unit of measure is the device unit (typically, the

pixel). Points on the screen are described by x-and y-coordinate pairs. The

x-coordinates increase to the right; y-coordinates increase from top to bottom.

The origin (0,0) for the system depends on the type of coordinates being used.







The system and applications specify the position of a window on the screen in

screen coordinates. For screen coordinates, the origin is the upper-left corner

of the screen. The full position of a window is often described by a RECT

structure containing the screen coordinates of two points that define the

upper-left and lower-right corners of the window.







The system and applications specify the position of points in a window by using

client coordinates. The origin in this case is the upper-left corner of the

window or client area. Client coordinates ensure that an application can use

consistent coordinate values while drawing in the window, regardless of the

position of the window on the screen.







The dimensions of the client area are also described by a RECT structure that

contains client coordinates for the area. In all cases, the upper-left

coordinate of the rectangle is included in the window or client area, while the

lower-right coordinate is excluded. Graphics operations in a window or client

area are excluded from the right and lower edges of the enclosing rectangle.







Occasionally, applications may be required to map coordinates in one window to

those of another window. An application can map coordinates by using the

MapWindowPoints function. If one of the windows is the desktop window, the

function effectively converts screen coordinates to client coordinates and vice

versa; the desktop window is always specified in screen coordinates.

   Window coordinates, the final coordinate system of interest to Canvas users,

are rarely used within the Canvas because most internal Canvas calculations use

world coordinates. Instead window coordinates are used usually outside of the

Canvas. Like canvas coordinates, window coordinates are pixel based, but they

are relative to the upper left corner of the top-level window that owns the

Canvas, rather than to the upper left corner of the Canvas widget.



 Id.; see also GnomeCanvas, The GNOME Project,

http://developer.gnome.org/libgnomecanvas/2.30/GnomeCanvas.html (last visited

Feb. 16, 2013). The Gnome Development Center states,







   There are several different coordinate systems used by GnomeCanvas widgets.

The primary system is a logical, abstract coordinate space called world

coordinates. World coordinates are expressed as unbounded double floating point

numbers. When it comes to rendering to a screen the canvas pixel coordinate

system (also referred to as just canvas coordinates) is used. This system uses

integers to specify screen pixel positions. A user defined scaling factor and

offset are used to convert between world coordinates and canvas coordinates.

Each item in a canvas has its own coordinate system called item coordinates.

This system is specified in world coordinates but they are relative to an item

(0.0, 0.0 would be the top left corner of the item). The final coordinate system

of interest is window coordinates. These are like canvas coordinates but are

offsets from within a window a canvas is displayed in. This last system is

rarely used, but is useful when manually handling GDK events (such as drag and

drop) which are specified in window coordinates (the events processed by the

canvas are already converted for you).

Mar. 18, 2013). As shown in Figure 1-1, the user space origin is located in the

upper-left corner of the space, with x values increasing to the right and y

values increasing downward. Figure 1-1 User Space Coordinate System User space

represents a uniform abstraction of all possible device coordinate systems. The

device space for a particular device might have the same origin and direction as

user space, or it might be different. Regardless, user space coordinates are

automatically transformed into the appropriate device space when a graphic

object is rendered. Often, the underlying platform device drivers are used to

perform this conversion.



   See Fred Schwartz, Screen Coordinates, Java Notes (Feb. 6, 2002),

http://www.leepoint.net/notes-java/GUI-lowlevel/graphics/10coord. Mr. Schwartz

explains,







   Java programs use an x,y coordinate system for all their graphic operations.

The x coordinate is the pixel distance from the left. The y coordinate is the

pixel distance from the top.







Note that the Java y coordinate system, like most other computer graphics

systems, is different from the normal math coordinate system where the y

coordinate goes up from the bottom.



 Id. (emphasis omitted); see also Coordinates, The Java Tutorials,

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/overview/coordinate.html (last visited

Feb. 16, 2013). An online Java tutorial states,







   When the default transformation from user space to device space is used, the

origin of user space is the upper-left corner of the component's drawing area.

The x coordinate increases to the right, and the y coordinate increases downward

... .The top-left corner of a window is 0,0. All coordinates are specified using

integers, which is usually sufficient. However, some cases require floating

point or even double precision which are also supported.

n47. " Public law" is defined as the:







   definition, regulation, and enforcement of rights in cases where the state is

regarded as the subject of the right or object of the duty ... and the law of

the state, considered in its quasi private personality, i.e., as capable of

holding or exercising rights, or acquiring and dealing with property, in the

character of an individual.



 Black's Law Dictionary 1106 (5th ed. 1979).



   In contrast "private law" is defined as law "which is concerned with the

definition, regulation, and enforcement of rights in cases where both [parties]

... are private individuals." Id. at 1076.



   Typically private law arises as a result of contract, property, and tort law

disputes and results in rights and duties that only bind the parties to the

transaction. The contracts, such as the one formed by a proper Internet "terms

of use" agreement, allows for enormous variation by virtue of publicly enforced

private law created by such a contract.











n48.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 12 (1981). The Restatement

explains,







   (1) No one can be bound by contract who has not legal capacity to incur at

least voidable contractual duties. Capacity to contract may be partial and its

existence in respect of a particular transaction may depend upon the nature of

the transaction or upon other circumstances.







(2) A natural person who manifests assent to a transaction has full legal

capacity to incur contractual duties thereby unless he is







(a) under guardianship, or







(b) an infant, or







(c) mentally ill or defective, or







(d) intoxicated.

a click-wrap agreement could manifest assent by clicking on an "I agree" icon,

whereas the manifestation of assent to a browse-wrap agreement can only be

inferred from inaction, and is thus unenforceable due to lack of assent).

n54.  See id. § 33. The Restatement indicates,







   (1) Even though a manifestation of intention is intended to be understood as

an offer, it cannot be accepted so as to form a contract unless the terms of the

contract are reasonably certain.







(2) The terms of a contract are reasonably certain if they provide a basis for

determining the existence of a breach and for giving an appropriate remedy.







(3) The fact that one or more terms of a proposed bargain are left open or

uncertain may show that a manifestation of intention is not intended to be

understood as an offer or as an acceptance.
