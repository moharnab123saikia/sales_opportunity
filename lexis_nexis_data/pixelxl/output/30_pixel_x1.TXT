Sony Bravia X9000C Series



Pricing unknown, available next month



Remember that old Sony TV with lockable doors, which was huge enough to double

as a spare surface for dumping books, ornaments and anything you did not have

time to put away immediately'



At its thinnest, Sony's new Bravia X9000C 4K LCD TV is only 4.9mm thick. Sony's

slimmest LCD TV is all but bezel-free. In your living room, it will look as if

it is floating.



Powered by Sony's new 4K Processor X1 and X-Reality Pro, the 4K (3,840 x 2,160

pixels) moving images deliver improved colour accuracy and stunning details.



This set supports Google's latest Android TV operating system, so it is easy for

Android smartphone users to stream videos, or to use the TV as a gaming device.

It comes in 55-inch and 65-inch models.

On Cloudsurfer

From the country that brought you high-precision mechanical watches, On is a

technology to transform running energy into forward momentum.



The CloudTech system features hollow pods on the outsole of the shoe. These

stretch back on impact to cushion your landing, then lock to form a solid

foundation for a powerful push-off.



Cloudsurfer is On's latest model to use this technology. Its mesh upper with

smart foam adapts to the foot for comfort and fit, while the durable high-grade

ethylene-vinyl acetate midsole makes Cloudsurfer a great training and racing

shoe.

LENS



Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 7-14mm F2.8 Pro



Pricing unknown, available next month



The Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 7-14mm F2.8 Pro is the lens that Olympus and

Micro Four Thirds (MFT) mirrorless camera users have been waiting for.



With an effective focal length of 14-28mm (a MFT image sensor has a 2x crop

factor) and a constant big aperture of f/2.8 throughout, it is perfect for

landscape, architecture and wedding photography.



Compact and lightweight at 534g, the lens will not weigh you down while you

pound the streets for that perfect shot. It is sealed against dust, water and

cold, so you can use it in most weather conditions.



SMARTPHONE



Panasonic Lumix DMC-CM1



$1,399



Add a 1-inch image sensor to a smartphone and you get the Panasonic Lumix

DMC-CM1. It is the world's slimmest communication camera at only 21.1mm,

according to Panasonic.



The 1-inch, 20.1-megapixel image sensor is the kind found only in some high-end

compact cameras, such as the Panasonic LX100. It gives superb low-light

performance with the wide-angle Leica 28mm f/2.8 lens. This 4.7-inch Android

smartphone delivers photos that other smartphones can only dream about.



A physical control ring around the lens gives you quick and direct access to

controls, such as shutter speed, aperture and ISO settings.
