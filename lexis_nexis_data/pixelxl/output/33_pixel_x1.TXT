Lava Iris X1 quick-read review: Just the camera is better than the Moto E



LENGTH: 458  words





The Moto E is currently our pick for the best low-cost Android around, and it is

now being challenged by several Indian manufacturers. The Lava Iris X1 is among

the top contenders, with a similar price tag and offering better features on

paper. Can it topple the king?



Specs: 4.5-inch IPS touchscreen (854480 pixels, 217 ppi) | 1.2GHz quad-core

Broadcom 23550 processor | 1GB RAM | 4GB internal memory, microSD card up to

32GB | Dual-SIM (SIM + micro SIM) | 8-megapixel rear camera, 2-megapixel front

camera, WVGA video recording | 3G (only on regular SIM), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4, GPS

| 1800mAh battery | Android 4.4 KitKat



Price: Rs 7,999



Design: Imagine the iPhone 4S made with low-cost materials and you have the Lava

Iris X1 on your hands. The front and back are completely flat, while the sides

have a chrome band going all around. Unlike the Moto E, it uses capacitive touch

buttons so you get full use of the screen space and the bezel is used well too.

The buttons are responsive, the phone doesn't heat up, and there is nothing to

dislike about the Iris X1-it seems like a handset that should be more expensive

than what it is.



Screen: To its credit, the 4.5-inch screen has decent colour reproduction and

viewing angles. But it has a few big problems. First, it does not have Gorilla

Glass or any scratch protection, which is not something worth compromising on.

Second, the screen has major issues with colour banding-basically, a colour does

not smoothly transition between shades, you see clear bands of different shades.

Perhaps most damagingly, the screen's response is weak. Often when tapping keys

or other things around the edges of the screen, the taps aren't registered.

Also, if you tap quickly-like speed typing on a keyboard-the screen misses some

input.



Performance: Despite a quad-core processor, the performance of the Iris X1 is

inferior to the Moto E's dual-core processor. It often lags or slows down, and

quick multi-tasking between several heavy apps caused it to hang twice in a week

of usage.



Camera: The camera is perhaps the highlight of the Iris X1-but that is only in

the context of its price. It's better than the Moto E in low-light shots and it

captures better details during the day. However, it's still slow to focus so you

will struggle with candid shots. It also lacks depth and the zoom is atrocious.

The good thing is that Lava's handset also has a front-facing camera for your

selfies and video calls-overall, in the camera department, it outscores the Moto

E.



Software: Google Android is now good enough not to need customisation by

manufacturers, and Lava does not make any attempt to do that. It's the latest

Android 4.4 KitKat and it works great!



Storage: With just 4GB of internal continued
