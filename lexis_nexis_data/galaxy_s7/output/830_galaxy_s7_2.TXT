Right on the heels of the success the S7 and S7 Edge had, Samsung does not seem
to want to stop. Of course, when news of a new phone is out, leaks are expected.
Here are some details that leaked about the Samsung Galaxy Note 6.

The leak was picked up by GSM Helpdesk, and according to the leak Samsung is set
to make some changes in terms of design and specifications. For starters, the
Samsung Galaxy Note 6 might come with an Edge display, given its recent
popularity. Additionally, this display will also be a larger 5.8 inch display.
Keeping up with its reputation for great battery life, the Samsung Galaxy Note 6
might also come with a massive battery, which will probably be around 4000 mAh.
The extra battery power will also be supported by 50% more RAM, bringing it to a
massive 6GB.

Samsung is not really the best at keeping secrets when it comes to their
flagships, however, it might still be a bit too early to blindly buy these
rumors.
