A recent leak from a Samsung employee spilled some beans on what to expect from
the Galaxy S7.

For starters, Samsung will bring back some of the features from the Galaxy S5
into the S7. The S7 will be waterproof and dust proof, and will also have
expandable memory, which Samsung aims to achieve through a hybrid dual SIM card
tray. These trays allow users to choose between having either one SIM and one
microSD card or two SIM cards instead. Removable batteries will still not be
there, but it could lead to a higher capacity battery.

Samsung will also be downgrading the megapixel count of its rear camera. Instead
of the 16 megapixels like on the Galaxy S6, the S7 will come with 12 megapixels.
However, the camera will come with a larger aperture, around f/1.7, and a better
quality sensor. It will also come with a dual pixel auto focus like some DSLRs.
The change is to shift focus from just the megapixel count to other factors as
well. The camera hump on the back will also be gone.

The Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge won't have the same sizes this time. The
flagship will measure 5.1 inches, but the edge variant will measure 5.5 inches,
thus putting it somewhere between the Galaxy S7 and edge+ variant.

However, these are the words of an unverified Samsung employee, so take this
news with caution. However, Android and Samsung fans might probably wish these
turn out to be true.
