

SAMSUNG has warned that the total cost of pulling its Galaxy Note7 smartphones
off the market will be at least £4.4bn.

The South Korean firm said discontinuing its flagship phone would cost the
company about 3.5 trillion won (£2.5bn) during the current and next quarter.

Samsung had already cut its thirdquarter profit forecast by £1.9bn earlier this
week, an amount that could wipe out its entire mobile business profit.

On Tuesday, Samsung scrapped its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, a day after
halting sales because of concerns over consumer safety with faulty units
overheating and exploding due to a battery defect.

But Samsung has enough cash to absorb the shock from the phone recall. The
company said it expects to generate 5.2 trillion won (£3.7bn) in operating
profit during the third quarter after the recall cost.

Samsung said it will make significant changes in its quality assurance processes
to enhance product safety for consumers.

The company said it will expand sales of two other smartphones released in
spring - the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.
