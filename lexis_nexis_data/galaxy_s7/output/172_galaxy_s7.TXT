Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, at Samsung Imax in Lahore. The entire area of
Samsung IMAX was turned into a new-age technology experience zone where people
could interact with the most powerful smartphones till date.

Samsung recently closed the pre-orders of Galaxy S7edge and Galaxy S7 where 70%
of the smartphones were pre-ordered within the first day of pre-order
announcement by Samsung. Samsung has seen overwhelming response and interest of
people in the newly launched powerful smartphones.

The advanced camera on Galaxy S7edge and Galaxy S7 captures more light to
deliver high quality images. The F1.7 lens on both sides of the phone and larger
pixels on the rear camera's image sensor allow for brighter and sharper images -
even in low light. It offers the world's first dual pixel sensor on a smartphone
camera, using 100% of the pixel on the Dual Pixel sensor for phase detection.
Each pixel has two photodiodes that capture light independently to enhance the
detection even in the dark. The camera also has the Motion Panorama, Hyperlapse
video mode, Selfie flash and spotlight features.
