Tuesday, August 04, 2015: South Korean tech giant Samsung has recently unveiled
its slimmest smartphone, the Galaxy A8 in the Indian market. With the thickness
of just 5.9mm, Galaxy A8 is very thin and light but not thin enough to surpass
Gionee Elife S7 and Oppo R5 which measures 5.5mm and 4.85mm respectively.
Currently Vivo X5Max holds the record of being the slimmest smartphone ever.
With the measurement of 4.75mm, it boasts to be a wafer thin handset.

If we talk about other specifications, Samsung Galaxy A8 sports a 14.47cm
(5.7-inch) full-HD Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels.
Powered by 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor with octa-core Samsung
Exynos 5430 System-on-Chip, the phone features 2GB of RAM and 32GB of in-built
storage which can be further expanded to 128GB via microSD. Packed with a
3050mAh battery, the device claims to deliver a standby time of up to 304 hours.
Besides, it also comes embedded with a fingerprint sensor.

The phone runs on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. It sports a 16MP rear camera with
optical image stabilisation, f/1.9 aperture, a wide-angle lens (120 degrees) and
LED flash alongside a 5MP front-facing camera. Its connectivity options include
Bluetooth 4.1, dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, GPS, Glonass, and LTE with
Band 40 (2300MHz) and Band 3 (1800MHz) support, which apparently means that
would work with all 4G networks in India.
