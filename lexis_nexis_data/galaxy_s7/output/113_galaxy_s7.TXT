The Samsung Galaxy S7 is easily one of the phones everyone is looking forward to
at MWC. While we are waiting, lets discuss a brand new rumor. Recent rumors
suggest that the Samsung Galaxy S7 will be able to juice out up to 48 hours of
battery life.

According to Russian tech blogger Eldar Murtazin, the Galaxy S7 will be capable
of not only 48 hours of battery life, but will be able to play 17 hours of video
playback at full brightness. The Galaxy S7 is believed to come with a 3000 mAh
battery unit, while its predecessor Galaxy S6 comes with a 2500 mAh cell.
However, although it may not seem much, the Galaxy S6 was able to provide up to
7 hours of battery life in a custom test, while the 3900 mAh Motorola Droid
Turbo was able to clock in close to 11 hours.

The Samsung Galaxy S7 will also come running Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the
box. This will give the device a guaranteed enhanced battery life, courtesy of
Doze. The Doze feature will put the handset to sleep by cutting down the apps
running at the background when not in use.

As for the release date, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge will be introduced on
Feb. 21 at the Samsung Unpacked event, a day befor the MWC 2016.
