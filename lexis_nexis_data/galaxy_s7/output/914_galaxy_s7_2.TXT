benefit from higher speeds.


EE is introducing a new technology that it says will boost network capacity and
deliver faster speeds for customers.

The operator will be extending its 4G+ network to enable access to a third block
of spectrum for high-speed 4G services on over 500 sites.

Already live in Wembley Stadium, this network will be activated on sites in
central London starting with Tech City. Sites such as Birmingham and Manchester
will have the network activated through 2016 and 2017.

The move is aimed at benefitting customers with Cat 9 smartphones such as the
HTC M10 and the Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge and Note 7 models. In a testing
environment, these devices can achieve 450 Mbps, but on most mobile networks
these speeds are not achievable.

According to EE, the HTC M10 in tests has achieved a real-world speed exceeding
360Mbps on the EE network at Wembley Stadium.

The new roll-out follows previous moves to support Cat 6 devices. For these, EE
enabled the first stage of the 4G+ network, which uses two blocks of mobile
spectrum, in over 150 towns and cities across the UK.

EE CEO Marc Allera said: "There's no point having the latest smartphones on a
network that can't support the top speeds the device is capable of. We've
invested in our network to ensure that all of our customers get the most out of
the amazing smartphones they have, and can keep up with the highest speeds that
the latest devices offer.

"With 4G+ now supporting Cat 9 devices, plus Wi-Fi Calling and 4G Calling,
customers on EE will continue to get more from their new smartphone than on any
other network"

Customers on an EE Extra or EE Complete plan will have no extra cost to use 4G+.
If eligible, users will connect to the service automatically.
