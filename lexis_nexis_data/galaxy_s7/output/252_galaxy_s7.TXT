The Samsung Galaxy S7 has been in the rumor mill a lot recently. The latest
rumors suggest that it will be coming in two different screen sizes.

According to a recent report from South Korea's ET News, the Samsung Galaxy S7
will come in two screen sizes. One version will reportedly have a flat, 5.2 inch
display while the other will be an Edge variant, with a curved 5.5 inch screen.
It was rumored earlier that the Galaxy S7 will include a 5.7 inch display, the
same size as the screen on the S6 Edge+.

Having two different screen sizes is a new strategy by Samsung, as its earlier
flagship S6 came in flat and curved screen variants, but with the same 5.1 inch
screen. This new approach is similar to competitor Apple, who released the
iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch screens respectively. ET News
also reported that Samsung is planning on an initial production run of
approximately 5 million units for the new Galaxy, which will be split between
3.3 million for the S7 and 1.6 million for the S7 Edge.

Reports from The Wall Street Journal also suggest that the S7 will have a March
release date and will look very similar to the S6 with a pressure sensitive
screen.
