 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 will be launched on August 2 as rumoured and the South
Korean electronics giant has confirmed the same.

portfolio. Second, the Galaxy Note7 will minimize confusion about the latest
mobile technology from Samsung, and provide full alignment with Galaxy S
smartphone."
 About the Galaxy Note 7, the company said it was "a powerful instrument for
achievement and self-expression, and is made for those who want to get the most
from their phones - and their lives".
 "Galaxy Note7 will help people do more in work, at home and everywhere in
between. We can't wait to tell you more about it," Samsung added.
 As per recent leaks, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 will feature a 5.7-inch QHD
Super AMOLED display with 12MP Dual Pixel rear camera plus and IP68
certification.
