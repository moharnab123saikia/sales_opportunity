

Even as consumers clamor for more and more "phablets", Apple Inc has reminded
the world that there are a certain number of small phone fans who tend to prefer
displays that are smaller than 5 inches across.

Apart from the latest iPhone SE, there are five other brands who have produced
high-end hardware specs with smaller screens.

Let's take a look at the six devices with relatively smaller screens on the
market according to iphone.265g.com, a domestic technology website.

iPhone SE

Presented by Apple as the most powerful 4-inch phone ever made by the company,
iPhone SE is equipped with a 4-inch 1136x640 (326 ppi) display. Powered by
Apple's latest A9 processor, the phone provides 2GB RAM and a 12 megapixel rear
camera. It allows users to shoot 4K video and also Live Photos. The phone also
offers functions such as Touch ID, Apple Pay and Retina Flash for dim lighting.

Samsung Galaxy S7

The Galaxy S7 features a 5.1-inch screen. It is the first smartphone with
dual-pixel technology, so it captures better photos in low-light environments
and focuses faster than the blink of an eye. The Galaxy S7 is powered by the
latest Android Marshmallow OS. The phone is also water resistant. It repels
spills, splashes and even dunks without a bulky protective case.

Smartisan T2

The Smartisan features a 4.95-inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel display, with a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 808 processor. The phone packs 3GB of RAM, and 16GB or 32GB of
storage.

What really makes the Smartisan T2 stand out though, is its software system
named Smartisan OS. It provides a tile-based user interface, a series of new
features and custom apps, such as auto arrange desktop icons by color, date, or
other criteria, a "remote assistance" app that allows a friend, family member,
or professional to take control of your phone to provide remote support, video
and GIF editors and screen recording.
