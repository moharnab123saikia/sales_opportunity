worldwide exchange and refund program to retrieve the devices. The program is
now live for the Philippines.

Based on the Philippine portal on Samsung's website, customers may have their
Galaxy Note 7 replaced with a Galaxy S7 Edge at the store of purchase. If the
desired model is not currently available, customers have the option to wait for
stocks to be replenished or simply get a refund amounting to the Note 7's
suggested retail price of P39,990. Samsung will also reimburse the price
difference between the S7 Edge and the Note 7.

As for customers who got their Note 7s from a telco plan, they need only contact
their telco operators. Globe subscribers may get in touch through the 7301000
landline or 211 mobile numbers. Smart subscribers, on the other hand, can head
over to the Smart Store where the device was bought.

More details can be found in Samsung's official announcement including how to
back up data and the requirements needed to avail of the exchange. Samsung
strongly urges customers to power down and hand over their Note 7 devices for
their own safety.
