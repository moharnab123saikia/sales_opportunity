paid a deposit for its now discontinued Galaxy Note 7 phone, plus a "comfort"
gift.

Customers can choose to buy one of its other models at 10,000 baht for a Galaxy
S7, Galaxy S7 Edge or Galaxy Note 5, and get a set of headphones free.

Customers can also choose to cancel the order and receive a 2,000-baht cash
voucher.

to fix.
