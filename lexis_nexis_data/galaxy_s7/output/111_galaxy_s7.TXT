forthcoming new flagship smartphone, Galaxy S7, will be available in two models
-- one with a 'flat' display, and the other featuring a 'curved' display -- just
like the company's other recent flagship handsets.

Similar to the recent Samsung flagship handsets, the curved-display model of the
new Galaxy S7 smartphone will likely be called the Galaxy S7 Edge.

According to recent rumors, the Galaxy S7 handset is expected to be unveiled by
Samsung in February 2016. The countries in which the Galaxy S7 will likely be
available upon launch will include major markets like the US, Canada, China,
Europe and Korea.

The carriers which will offer the Samsung Galaxy S7 handsets in these countries
will reportedly include AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and
MetroPCS in the US; Bell Mobility in Canada; and KT, LG Uplus, SKTelecom and
Cricket in Korea.

The Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone will be available in 5.2-inch and 5.8-inch
screen sizes; with the Exynos 8890 chip powering some models and the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 processor powering the others. The handset will come with 3GB or
4GB of RAM, and a 20-megapixel ISOCELL camera.
