Although it looks similar to last year's device, the new Galaxy S7 is packed
with extra features which will make it the smartphone to beat in 2016.

The S7 gets a speed boost, lasts longer with a bigger battery, and features an
upgraded rear camera which is faster and better in low light.

It's also waterproof and has expandable storage, meaning you should never run
low on space.

The S7 and S7 edge can be pre-ordered now with prices starting from Â£569.

Samsung has also unveiled a new virtual reality camera that can film 360-degree
footage.

The Gear 360 will launch alongside the Galaxy S7.
