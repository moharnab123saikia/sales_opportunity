service Samsung Pay in the Asia-Pacific region by launching it in Australia.

The service, which is already available in South Korea, US, China, and Spain,
will be supported by American Express and Citibank at launch, the company said.

Samsung Pay will work only on the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy S6 edge+,
Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge.

It uses fingerprint authentication and digital tokens to encrypt the
cardholder's information and provide a strong level of security. The app also
uses MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission), which enables it to be used on most
terminals, including magnetic stripe.

Samsung Australia vice president for mobile division Prasad Gokhale said:
"Today's launch of Samsung Pay offers more than a secure and convenient way for
Samsung smartphone owners to pay. It's the next development for Australians who
use their smartphone as the central device to live, organise and enjoy their
lives."

"Australia is a market of early technology adopters and by providing a platform
open to all partners, ranging from government to financial institutions and
retailers, while upholding the highest standards of security and data privacy,
Samsung is fueling the transition to a truly digital wallet."
