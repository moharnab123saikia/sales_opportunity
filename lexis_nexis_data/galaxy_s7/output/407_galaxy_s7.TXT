overall smartphones sales this year.

Through consistent smartphone innovation and positioning as the global leading
brand in smartphone market, Samsung was confident that its newest product,
Galaxy S7 edge, would do well in Malaysia, said Lee Jui Siang, its
vice-president of mobile, information technology and digital imaging.

Lee said the Note 5 did very well last year and expected the same for the S7
edge.

Last year's sales were mainly driven by the launches of different products, such
as its Galaxy Note 5, the A-series and J-series.

Despite the challenging economic situation, Lee said the company would continue
to drive innovation because the reality was that consumers were still looking
for new devices.

"As long as we continue to excite the market, we will continue to drive good
sales and good growth," he said.

On the target audience of the product, Lee said the S7 edge had a "broad appeal"
and the demographics might range from students to youths to corporate consumers.

The S7 edge has a 5.5-inch enhanced screen, five-megapixel front camera,
12-megapixel back camera and a wider aperture of F1.7.

The S7 edge is offered at a retail price of RM3,099, inclusive of Goods and
Services Tax, and is available in three colours - black onyx, silver titanium
and gold platinum.
