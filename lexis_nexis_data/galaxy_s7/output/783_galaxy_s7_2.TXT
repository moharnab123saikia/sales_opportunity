mobile as it launches Samsung Pay in the country in a partnership with China
UnionPay.

Samsung follows Apple, which launched in China in February and counted three
million cards set up with Apple Pay within the first two days. Samsung Pay will
work on Samsung's Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, Galaxy S6 edge+ and Galaxy Note5
devices, with support for other models planned down the line.

Nine banks are already on board, with six further banks supporting Samsung Pay
in the future.

Both brands face competition in China from homegrown companies, with Alibaba's
Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay and TenPay, along with Baidu's mobile wallet
already firmly established. The value of mobile payment transactions surpassed
Â£261bn in the third quarter of 2015, according to iResearch.
