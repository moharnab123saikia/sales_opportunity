sign of robust early sales for its new Galaxy S7 smartphones although doubts
abound whether momentum can be maintained in the face of new rival offerings.

The South Korean tech giant's estimate for first-quarter operating profit easily
beat market forecasts. It has boosted hopes that its struggling mobile business
will post its first annual profit gain in three years, also benefiting from an
improved performance for mid-to-low tier devices and cost-cutting.

Samsung said January-March operating profit was likely to be 6.6 trillion won
(EUR 5bn), well above the 5.6 trillion won profit tipped by a Thomson Reuters
StarMine SmartEstimate derived from a survey of 23 analysts.

The firm will not disclose a full breakdown of its results until later this
month, and gave no comment on the performance of its business divisions.

More than a dozen brokerages had lifted forecasts for Samsung earnings since
late last month, encouraged by reports of better-than-expected sales of its
Galaxy S7 models, which boast an improved camera, waterproofing and microSD
storage support. Samsung's mobile business was probably the top earner for the
first time in seven quarters, analysts say.

A decline in the value of the South Korean won is also expected to help lift the
firm's first-quarter bottom line. But even so, competition from new products
such as Apple's recently launched iPhone SE and Huawei Technologies' upcoming
flagship P9 phone are tempering investor enthusiasm.

"First quarter earnings will be the peak this year," said HMC Investment analyst
Greg Roh, adding that marketing costs for the mobile business would rise in the
next quarter, pushing profits lower.

Some analysts said Samsung's decision to launch the Galaxy S7 models a month
earlier than their predecessors may have simply have brought forward sales. -
