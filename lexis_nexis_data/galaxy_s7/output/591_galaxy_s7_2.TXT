but their ambitions for 2017 are even grander.

According to reputable Samsung blog SamMobile, the South Korean manufacturer is
planning on releasing five new flagship phones next year.

Some of the rumoured upcoming devices aren't too surprising. Like usual, Samsung
will be updating the Galaxy S series, with the S8 and S8 Edge.

They'll also be bringing out the Galaxy Note 7 and Note 7 Edge, follow-ups to
the forthcoming Note 6.

Most interesting, however, is what SamMobile calls the Galaxy X - a
revolutionary foldable smartphone, which can expand to be used as a tablet.

The S7 Edge already has a curved screen, but the Galaxy X would take things
further. The phone has been in development for a while, under the codename
'Project Valley', and leaks have so far suggested that it will look like a
regular smartphone when folded, but will double in size when opened.

Releasing the long-awaited foldable phone next year would make sense. Smartphone
sales are falling for most major manufacturers, and each new device seems to be
more similar than different to its predecessor.

Making such a radically different phone would put Samsung ahead of the pack,
potentially boosting their sales.

Samsung doesn't comment on rumours, so there's no news on the release dates or
prices of these futuristic phones. Based on past launch schedules, however, you
can expect the S8 and S8 Edge to release in early Spring, with the Note and
Galaxy X devices potentially coming out in the second half of the year.
