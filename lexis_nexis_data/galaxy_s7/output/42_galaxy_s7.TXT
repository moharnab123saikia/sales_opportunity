Tuesday, February 23, 2016:  Samsung Electronics has added two new devices to
its Galaxy family. These are the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. The
devices were launched at the Mobile World Congress held in Barcelona on Monday,
22 February.

"We believe in a world that is brighter, sharper, more convenient, and more fun.
We strive to deliver on that vision with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge by
marrying elegant design with functionality and providing a seamless mobile
experience," said DJ Koh, President of Mobile Communications Business, Samsung
Electronics.

Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge introduce the first dual pixel camera on a
smartphone, delivering brighter and sharper images, even in low light. The
camera has a faster shutter speed and a more accurate autofocus even in
low-light conditions.

photos, giving the user a completely immersive visual experience. Samsung also
