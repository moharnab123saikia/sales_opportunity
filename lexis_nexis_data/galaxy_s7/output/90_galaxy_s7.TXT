products, Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. Created for today's consumer
lifestyle, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge lead the industry with a refined design,
more advanced camera, streamlined software functionality and unparalleled
connectivity to a galaxy of products, services, and experiences.

We believe in a world that is brighter, sharper, more convenient, and more fun.
We strive to deliver on that vision with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge by
marrying elegant design with functionality and providing a seamless mobile
experience, said DJ Koh, President of Mobile Communications Business, Samsung
Electronics. We empower consumers with technology to help them get more out of
life and will continue to push the frontier of what's possible.

Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge introduce the first Dual Pixel camera on a
smartphone, delivering brighter and sharper images, even in low light. Thanks to
the revolutionary Dual Pixel technology, brighter lens with wider aperture, and
bigger pixel, the camera has a faster shutter speed and a more accurate
autofocus even in low-light conditions. Motion Panorama, a new camera mode,
brings movement to traditional panoramic photos, giving the user a completely
immersive visual experience.
