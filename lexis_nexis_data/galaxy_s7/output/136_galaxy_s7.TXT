Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, just 15 days after their global launch on February
21.

The handset maker has priced the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, at Rs 48,900 and
Rs 56,900, respectively.

One will get a chance to pre-book the device between 8-17 March. Those who
pre-book, will get a VR headset for free as well.

The devices are being made in Samsung's Indian plant.

Samsung wants to build on the success of the S6, which drew acclaim for design
and innovative features. It's also looking to make the most of a quarter that's
usually slow for rivals, especially Apple. Marketing will be aggressive,
analysts said. ET recently reported that the company will spend Rs 100 crore on
marketing in India.

The S7 comes with a 5.1-inch super AMOLED dispay with 2550 x 1440 pixels. In
this year's version of its flagship, Samsung has bumped up the RAM to 4GB.

Similar to the Galaxy S7, its curved sibling also boasts of 4GB RAM. However, it
comes with a 5.5-inch display with 2550 x 1440 pixels as compared to the
5.1-inch in the Samsung Galaxy S7.
