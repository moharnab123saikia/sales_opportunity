giant, go on sale in India, there is a warning you must be aware of:
region-locked sim cards.READ ALSO:On the Galaxy S7 edge review unit we have
received,has put a sticker saying 'Indian sim card only,' meaning that only the
smartphone should be used only with sim cards sold in India. A similar warning
can be seen on the units sold in Europe.What does this mean?Region-locking a
smartphone means that the device won't work if a sim card of another region is
inserted.

This is a way for Samsung to ensure that gray market sellers don't pick up S7
and S7 edge units from markets like Hong Kong and sell them in countries.Samsung
started this practice with the launch of Galaxy Note 3, which was launched in
2013.Is there a way to subvert this?Yes, all you need to do is to insert the sim
card of the right region and make calls using it for 5 minutes. This will remove
the region-locking of the handset. That's it.How does this stop gray market
sellers?If a gray market seller buys Samsung Galaxy S7 orfrom Europe and sells
it in India, the buyer would need a sim card of the market, which is highly
unlikely. The only way for gray market sellers to avoid this would be to open
the box and make calls from region-locked smartphone for 5 minutes. But buyers
would not be inclined to purchase a phone that has already been opened.This
would help Samsung curb gray market.
