Kolkata, Oct. 20 -- Samsung India Electronics will make all future launches,
including entry-level smart phones, with 4G facility and it expects to gain a
bigger market share on the back of the new launches, a top company official said
on Thursday.


 "There is huge conversion happening from feature phones to smart phones at the
entry level. This migration will continue. All the future launches, including
entry-level segment, will have 4G facilities and we will sell 4G devices. But at
the same time, there will be certain set of feature phones users because of
price points," said the Samsung's Vice President (Mobiles Business) Manu Sharma.

 He said the mobile maker has experienced growth in sales this year but declined
to give details of sales figures.
 "We expect that the company will gain its market share on the back of new
launches," he said on the sidelines of the launch of a new version of 'My
Galaxy' application.
 According to latest data, in the smart phone market, the mobile maker at
present has 48.7 per cent share in terms of value.
 Speaking on the the Galaxy Note 7, he confirmed that the company will refund
consumers who bought the smart phones outside the country. "They can go to our
service centre and get refunded," he said, adding that it did not sell the
device in India.
 In lieu of the Galaxy Note 7 pre-book offer, the company has offered Samsung
Galaxy S7/S7 Edge, he said.
 The application was developed by Indian team at company's research and
development institute in Bangalore. "It is a testimony to our passion for
innovation and localisation. India becomes the fourth largest app economy after
China, US and Brazil," Sharma added.
