smarphone Galaxy S7 will hover above those of its predecessor after hitting
store shelves across the world next month.

"The Galaxy S7 is slated to go on sale in 60 countries on March 11. We expect
its sales to surpass shipments of the previous model, the Galaxy S6," Koh
Dong-jin, head of Samsung's mobile division, said Monday on the sidelines of the
world's biggest tech fair underway in Barcelona, Spain.

On Sunday, Samsung Electronics showcased the latest Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge
smartphones, which come with improved battery and water-dust resistance
features. The company also brought back the micro SD card slot that had
disappeared in the Galaxy S6 series.

Industry watchers estimate shipments of the Galaxy S6 at around 38 million units
for 2015.

"We tried to add as many features as possible (to the Galaxy S7) that were
discontinued in the previous models," Koh added.

Koh also said the introduction of a virtual reality camera will speed up
production of user-made content in the industry.

"Although there are still things to overcome in terms of hardware, I believe it
is not a big issue," Koh said, highlighting the importance of content in
promoting the VR segment.

Koh did not elaborate on the vision for the Galaxy S8, but added the company
will continue its innovative efforts. (Yonhap)
