curved-screen Galaxy S7 Edge made up more than 50 percent of its total flagship
S7 sales in the April-June period.

The Korean tech giant didn't reveal the specific sales figure of the S7 phones
during the conference call on the day.

Industry watchers estimate a combined 270 million S7 and its Edge variant phones
have been sold in the first half of this year since their March launch.

Running on the upbeat mood, Samsung has also adopted the curved screen for the
upcoming Note 7 phablet for the first time. The new Note will be unveiled on
Aug. 2 in New York, London and Rio de Janeiro.
