

Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus despite being better in every manner, lag behind
when you plug them in the wall socket in comparison to other phones

New 12MP cameras, with better performing A10 chips and still Apple couldn't
figure out to reduce the total charging time on its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.
That's because just like its predecessors, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, Apple
has continued to ship its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with 5W chargers, so you
can imagine how long it would take for these smartphones to get charged
completely.

In fact, according to a detailed review done by Anandtech for the iPhone 7 and 7
Plus, both iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus are able to charge faster than Apple's
latest mobile products, but that is also because they feature smaller battery
capacities than their successors. The disappointing thing about these tests is
that devices like Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, which feature larger batteries
than iPhone 7 Plus are able to charge much faster, but that is thanks to
improved charging technology.

This does not mean that you continue to use the 5W charger that comes bundled
with your iPhone. You can also resort to using the iPad charger or another
aftermarket charger, but before you do, make sure that its charging
specifications are in line with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus' requirements.
According to the test results, we have included a total of six different phones
as well as the amount of time it takes for their batteries to go from 0-100
percent.

Galaxy S7 (Snapdragon 820 version): 1.51 hours
Galaxy S7 edge (Snapdragon version): 1.85 hours
iPhone 6s: 1.94 hours
iPhone 6s Plus: 2.80 hours
iPhone 7: 2.08 hours
iPhone 7 Plus: 3.07 hours

Hopefully, with the announcement of iPhone 8, Apple will realize to ship out a
more powerful charger. With these devices coming without a headphone jack, it is
becoming necessary to improve charging technologies.
