Edge handset catches fire surfaced in Philippines.

A Galaxy S7 Edge from the Philippines caught fire for reasons unknown to date.
Weng Briones, the owner of the ill-fated handset posted images of a completely
destroyed S7 Edge, claiming that the phone began to heat up and smoke.

"We went to Samsung store at SM City Taytay and they have refunded my money in
full," wrote Briones on Facebook.

"Kudos to all the staff of Samsung SM Taytay for their immediate action
regarding my issue. In spite of the unfortunate incident, I am however,
impressed by their after-sales support. Much respect to Samsung. Keep safe
everyone."

The incident comes after Galaxy Note 7, which was released amid much fanfare in
August, made headlines after events of faulty batteries, led Samsung to take a
major step of a global recall of the product.

Samsung had to temporarily halt sales of the newly launched device and had to
offer exchange units for the hazardous ones, reported Tech Times.

Meanwhile, this is not the first Galaxy S7 Edge to catch flames. A man from New
Jersey sustained second- and third-degree burns after a Galaxy S7 edge exploded
in his shirt pocket earlier this month. However, BGR reported that the events
are isolated incidents, so one should not panic about their Galaxy S7 edge.
