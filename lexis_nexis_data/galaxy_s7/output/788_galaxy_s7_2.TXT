new Galaxy Note to replicate the sales momentum of its hot-selling Galaxy S7
Edge.

According to news reports on June 16, the Korean tech giant plans to start
rolling out the upcoming Note Phablet from July with the initial production
estimated to stand at about 2.5 million units per month.

Samsung declined to confirm the reports.

The company is scheduled to hold a Galaxy Note unpacked event on Aug. 2 in New
York. Even though it is the sixth version, the new Note is widely rumored to be
named "Galaxy Note 7" in order to align its Galaxy S families.

Largely buoyed by robust sales of Edge variants, the Galaxy S7 sold almost 10
million units in the first quarter. Analysts estimate its second-quarter sales
also could surge to 15 million units.
