returning the devices as part of a global safety recall following reports of
overheating batteries that pose a fire hazard.

Samsung Electronics Canada Inc., which is based in Mississauga, has advised
consumers to return the phones to the stores where they were bought.

Devices returned to retailers and carriers can be exchanged for a Galaxy S7 or
Galaxy S7 Edge phone, or customers can opt for a full refund for the recalled
Note 7s and specific accessories.

Samsung.com customers are being offered a refund on receipt of the Galaxy Note
7s.

Samsung Canada says it will contact customers who bought their smartphones
through Samsung.com about the return process.

The South Korean electronics giant said Tuesday it would stop making and selling
the Note 7s and advised owners to turn off and stop using the smartphones.
