on or charge their Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones in-flight due to concerns over
the devices' batteries catching fire.

The agency further recommends travellers not to stow their phones in checked
baggage.

Last week, Samsung announced that it was recalling all Galaxy Note 7
smartphones, found to be equipped with fire-prone batteries that started
distribution in August, from across the globe, reported USA Today.

The phone manufacturer has also offered to exchange the phones for a Galaxy S7
or Galaxy S7 edge.

The FAA in a statement said: "In light of recent incidents and concerns raised
by Samsung about its Galaxy Note 7 devices, the FAA strongly advises passengers
not to turn on or charge these devices on-board aircraft and not to stow them in
any checked baggage."

Bigger lithium batteries previously created issues for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner
aircraft and had caused short-circuits and damage planes in the US and Japan.

Following the FAA warning, US-based Delta Air Lines has issued a customer
advisory for airline passengers travelling with a Samsung Note 7.

The airline advised its customers who have the device to take the phone on-board
aircraft or place it in carry-on baggage only.

While on-board the aircraft, the passengers are requested to turn off and not
charge the device.

Meanwhile, the UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) has also prohibited
the use of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones during flights operated by the country's
national carriers, reported WAM.
