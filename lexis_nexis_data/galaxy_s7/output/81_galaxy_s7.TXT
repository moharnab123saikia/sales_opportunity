Edge units are exploding!

It looks like the number of smartphone explosion cases are increasing every day,
and the most being reported are Samsung smartphones! While the recently launched
in-famous Galaxy Note 7 was pulled back for the same reason, it looks like a
recent report points at a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge being exploded.

It is being said that the user had put his smartphone to charge with the
original Samsung charger overnight, when this incident occurred. The Galaxy S7
caught fire automatically, according to the sources.

Adding to this, PhoneArena has reported that the same user had settled for
Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge after replacing his Galaxy Note 7 after the company
announced to kill the device permanently. The images of the burnt Galaxy S7 have
been published on PhoneArena, and it looks like, it is definitely not
repairable.

However, this is not the first that that a report about the explosion of Galaxy
S7 has surfaced. In-fact, last month, we came across a report that alleged about
a Galaxy S7 Edge being exploded inside the pocket of a Ohio resident, resulting
in burn injuries to him.

While the company has sent out pop-up messages that the Galaxy S7 units are safe
and no devices will be recalled, it seems to high time for the company to
investigate once again seriously, especially after the rise of the recent
explosion incident.
