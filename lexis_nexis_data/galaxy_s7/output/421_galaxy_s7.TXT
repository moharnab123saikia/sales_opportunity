largest smartphone maker Samsung recently reported better-than-expected jump in
net profits, boosted by the successful early release of its new flagship Galaxy
S7. The company rolled out the latest version of its Galaxy S series, Galaxy S7
smartphone, in March.The strong Galaxy S7 performance came in the face of a
flattening global smartphone market that saw arch-rival Apple report its
first-ever drop in iPhone sales since launching the handset in 2007.According to
research firm IDC, the worldwide smartphone market saw its slowest growth in the
first quarter, growing just 0.2%. In India too, Samsung recently claimed that it
has overtaken Apple to top India's premium smartphone segment in the
January-March quarter.

Hong Kong-based shipment tracker Counterpoint Research's figures show thatin
January-March rose to 62% from 35% in the preceding quarter. Apple's share, in
contrast, fell to 37% from 55%. GfK, which tracks end-consumer sales in
50,000-plus population markets, had narrowly placedat the top in the
October-December quarter last year. However, its lead has widened substantially
and as per GfK estimates, the Korean company's market share in the January-March
quarter is 50% as opposed to Apple's 41%.
