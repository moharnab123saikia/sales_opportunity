the Olympics next month. But there's another test underway as well: How well can
virtual reality capture sporting events?

NBC says it will provide 85 hours of virtual reality programming during the Rio
Olympics in August - though only to users of Samsung Galaxy smartphones and the
Samsung Gear VR headset. It's the first time Olympics programming will be
available in VR.

Virtual reality coverage of sports, essentially 360 video, has been growing
since VR headsets such as the Samsung Gear and Oculus Rift became widely
available earlier this year.

But right now, the audience is limited to those that have smartphones and VR
headsets, which can be pricey.

Viewers will need Samsung devices and the NBC Sports app. Samsung is the
official smartphone sponsor of the 2016 Olympics in Rio.

Compatible phones include the Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6,
Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge+ and Galaxy Note 5 phones.

The Olympics will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Argentina on Aug. 5 to 21.
