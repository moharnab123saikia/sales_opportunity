Samsung S7 owners is reportedly getting a direct notification on their phones
reminding them that their devices are not under the same worldwide recall
program as the Note 7.

The message is clearly meant to inform Galaxy S7 owners and also perhaps to
reassure them their phone will not explode. Samsung seems to think that some
Galaxy S7 owners have started to confuse their phone for the Note7 because they
both have a 7 in their name, even the S7 came out months before the Note 7.

For sure, Samsung does not want Galaxy S7 owners to return or exchange their
phones for something else out of confusion. Due to recent events, the company
has already cut back its profit forecast for the third quarter of 2016 from 7.8
trillion won (about $7.0 billion) down to 5.2 trillion won ($4.6 billion) due to
the Note 7 recall. Some financial analysts are predicting the revenue loss for
Samsung could be as high as $17 billion. Those predictions could get even worse
if S7 owners think their phones could blow up as well.
