Samsung has officially begun selling refurbished smartphones in the US, after
reports emerged last month detailing plans for the same.

The Korean tech giant has just launched is Certified Pre-Owned Phones store.
Samsung smartphones may look great and function even better, but the brand's
average price range is out of reach for most users. An option to purchase
refurbished models would seriously benefit the mid-range buyer, looking to buy
into the Samsung legacy.

Samsung meanwhile is doing everything it can to make the process smoother.
Refurbished devices purchased on the official store will receive a 12-month
warranty, as well as free shipping (within the US for now).

You can find true variety among the secondhand models, aside from the biggest
recent launches like the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge or the Note 7. However, you can
save US $200 on the likes of a Galaxy S6 Edge, or Galaxy Note 4.

You can find the Samsung Certified Pre-Owned Phones store here, to check out
some of the available deals yourself. The phones are currently supported on all
four major US carriers, and Samsung says more models will be added soon.

However, there's no word on if and when we can see a similar service being
offered in India
