

Samsung has released pink gold editions of their Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.

The pink versions of the smartphones were released first in South Korea, and
will roll out in select markets.

Samsung says they chose to add a pink gold hue to the collection because it's
soothing and "provides a sense of comfort."

The smartphones are also available in Black Onyx, Gold Platinum, White Pearl and
Silver Titanium.
