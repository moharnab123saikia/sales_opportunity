

NEW YORK (AP) -- Apple and Samsung phones, which have been looking more and more
alike over the past few years, are much closer to virtual twins with Samsung's
latest Galaxy S7.

The convergence began two years ago when iPhones got larger, mimicking Samsung's
once-innovative, plus-sized "phablets." Last spring, Samsung started emphasizing
higher quality materials and sophisticated design, just as Apple had for years.
And last fall, Apple boosted the resolution on the iPhone camera, narrowing one
of the major gaps it had with Samsung.

With the S7, Samsung is lowering its camera's resolution -- you read that right
-- to match the iPhone's 12 megapixels.

To be sure, there are key differences. Only the latest iPhones have special
features you activate by pressing harder on an icon or link, while Samsung is
among the biggest boosters of virtual reality.

It's too early to say which phone is better. Though Samsung announced the S7 on
Sunday at a wireless show in Barcelona, Spain, the phone isn't coming out until
March 11. My hands-on time has been limited to controlled settings.

And for most users it may end up being a draw -- Samsung leads the pack among
Android phones, while Apple has its own self-contained ecosystem, iOS. For many,
a choice between the two could come down to preference for one system or another
-- and the apps available for each.

In terms of size, Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 is slightly larger and heavier
than the 4.7-inch iPhone 6s, but not much so. There's a premium version of the
S7 called the S7 Edge; both sides curve like a waterfall, such that the screen
flows over the side to the back of the phone. The Edge screen is 5.5 inches, but
much of that comes from the curvature.
