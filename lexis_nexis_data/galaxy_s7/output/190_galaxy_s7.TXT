The Samsung Galaxy S7 is easily one of the most discussed phones on the Internet
these days. Now, a whole new set of images have leaked, merely weeks ahead of
the Galaxy S7.

After the press renders and hands on images leaked recently, professional
leakster Evan Blaas or @evleaks revealed some more new images, which gives the
phone a whole new look. According to the images leaked, there will be a silver
version of the curved screen device, which will be coming with a massive 3600
mAh battery. Although it looks very similar to the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+, it
shows its different with a subtle curve at the top and bottom of the device,
complementing the more dramatic curvature of the laterals, a design touch seen
on the hands on of the S7 Edge as well.

This is the first look at the silver version of the S7, as all the leaks up to
now have been of a black device. This also confirmed that the Galaxy S7 will
bring just minor changes in terms of design when compared to its predecessor. A
very visible difference is the camera lens, which does not protrude as much as
the earlier one, which provides for a more streamlined look.

The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are expected to be revealed on February 21st
at its event at MWC Barcelona, and will be out for sale on March.
