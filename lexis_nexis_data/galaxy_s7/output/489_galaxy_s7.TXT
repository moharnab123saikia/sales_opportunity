April-June period on July 7 that it would post approximately 8.1 trillion won
(US$7 billion) in operating profit in the second quarter while its revenue would
come in at 50 trillion won.

The estimated operating income and revenue for the second quarter increased from
6.9 trillion won and 48.5 trillion won, respectively, in the same period last
year.

The first quarter of 2014 was the last time that Samsung posted more than 8
trillion won in operating income.

Market analysts said the upbeat sales of the firm's flagship smartphones Galaxy
S7 and S7 Edge may have boosted its earnings.

Buoyed by the robust sales of the smartphones, the second quarter operating
profit of Samsung's mobile business unit is estimated to stand at 4.4 trillion
won, which accounts for 54.3 percent of the firm's entire operating profit. The
figure increased by 59.4 percent on-year.

Around 26 million units of the Galaxy S7 have reportedly been sold worldwide --
10 million in the first quarter and 16 million in the second quarter.

Even though the number of sales is not as many as that for the Galaxy S4,
released in 2013, the firm's profit margin is said to have much improved due to
its strategy of putting focus on the high-end smartphone lineup.
