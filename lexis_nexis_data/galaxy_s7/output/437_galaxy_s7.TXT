model - the S7 - on Sunday. And a teaser video from the maker's Indonesian
branch shows the new device has revived the waterproof feature from its previous
model, the S5.

The one-minute video, released Monday, features Indonesian female archer Dellie

encounters heavy rain. She flips through her device's rain-covered screen
without a problem.

camera.

'Seven Days of Unboxing,' is being released daily until Feb. 22. They show a
person or animal unboxing a S7 in a futuristic lab and introducing their own
creative image of the device.

Samsung will unveil the S7 series in Barcelona, one day before the start of the
Mobile World Congress, the biggest global gathering of mobile device makers and
mobile app developers.
