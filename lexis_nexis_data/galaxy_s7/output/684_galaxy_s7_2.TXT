

With the latest Samsung Galaxy flagship handsets -- Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge
-- having been unveiled by the South Korean device maker at the 2016 Mobile
World Congress trade show last week, speculations are now making rounds about an
apparently forthcoming introduction of Galaxy Note 6.

Against the backdrop of Samsung's precedence of unveiling new devices in the
Note smartphone line in the month of August every year, it is being rumored that
the much-anticipated Galaxy Note 6 will be launched by Samsung in Europe in
August 2016.

The speculations of a possible August launch of Galaxy Note 6 are, more
specifically, based on the fact that Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 5, in
coincidence with the launch of Galaxy S6 Edge, on August 13 last year.

In the wake of the speculated unveiling of the Galaxy Note 6 by Samsung in
August, rumors have started making rounds on the Internet about the memory chip
inside the upcoming handset. The rumors are rooted in Samsung's announcement on
February 25 that it has commenced the mass production of the 256 GB UFS 2.0
memory chips, which the company evidently plans to use in high-end handsets.

About the memory chips, Samsung said in part of its press release: "The new
256GB UFS memory is capable of supporting seamless Ultra HD video playback and
multitasking functionality on large-screen mobile devices."
