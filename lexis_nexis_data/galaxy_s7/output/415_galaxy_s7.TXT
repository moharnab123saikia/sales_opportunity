department, both devices perform equally

HTC 10 has been officially announced, and the very first thing that we will do
is compare one of its weapons to the competition. On this occasion, HTC has been
bragging about how impressive the camera is going to be and went as far as
labelling it as the UltraPixel 2. The 12MP sensor according to DxOMark was able
to score 88 points, which is in line with Galaxy S7 edge, and 1 point higher
than Galaxy S7, which scored 87 points.

According to the details of the tests, the camera of HTC 10 performs
terrifically, as stated by the following pros:

Image capture Very good details preservation in all conditions

However, while the device's camera performs beyond our expectations, you will
obviously encounter some drawbacks, which have been listed below:

Image capture Visible loss of sharpness in the corners with respect to the
center

the corners
Video capture Some residual motion in walking movements

improve the camera side of things. As for the different color models HTC 10 will
ship in four models: Carbon Grey, Glacier Silver, Topaz Gold, and Camellia Red,
and they'll come in two versions with different Qualcomm Snapdragon processors
