Barcelona, June 3 -- South Korea's handset maker LG on Sunday unveiled its first

independently upgraded or replaced - comes with a removable battery and
accessories such as virtual reality headset and a sound system developed by
Danish firm Bang & Olufsen.

 LG is banking on its G5 to counter competition from fellow South Korean
Samsung, the world's top handset maker that is due to unveil its own S7
smartphone on Sunday evening on the eve of the start of the Mobile World
Congress, the top annual trade show for wireless devices.
 The G5 will be launched at the same time on LG's main markets, CEO Juno Cho
told reporters in Barcelona, without detailing exactly where and when.

 "We think smartphones' best days are still ahead," said Juno Cho, despite
slowing growing demand that saw rival Samsung's fourth quarter net profits drop
and Apple's iPhone sales rise slower than ever in the same period.
 Meanwhile LG's parent company LG Electronics' net profit halved last year on
the back of a global economic slowdown and increased competition in the mobile
sector.
