Samsung may have accidentaly revealed a new smartphone, and it looks like a
descendent of the ruggedized Galaxy S6 Active.

Spotted by SamMobile, the Galaxy S7 Active appears in a list of supported
devices for the Samsung Level app on the Google Play Store. The company's Active
series was first introduced in 2013 as a waterproof, shockproof counterpart to
the then flagship Galaxy S4.

What's strange is that Samsung has already included IP68 water and dust
resistance, leaving the possible S7 Active with only a ruggedized casing to
claim as a unique sell point, aside from the Active series' improved battery
over the standard line. There's no other real evidence there will even be a
Galaxy S7 Active, and Samsung has so far not confirmed any such device, so don't
hold your breath just yet.
