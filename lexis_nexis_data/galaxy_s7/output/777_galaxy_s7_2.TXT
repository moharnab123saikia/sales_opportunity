for its next flagship Galaxy 8 that is expected to come out next year with a
curved display only, industry sources said on Sept. 8.

The move comes after the Galaxy S7 Edge outpaced its flat-screen sibling in
terms of sales. Now the Korean tech giant is promoting the curvy screen as its
premium smartphone lineup's key identity.

Sources said the company has already started securing display panels in two
sizes -- 5.1 inch and 5.5 inch -- from its own display-making unit Samsung
Display, the world's sole producer of double-edged screens.

For the latest Galaxy Note 7, the company has also launched a curved-screen
version only.

The yield rate is key to the strategy.

In 2015 when the company adopted the curvy screen for the first time for the
Galaxy S6 Edge, it failed to continue the sales momentum due to supply
constraints.

"It was a heart-breaking experience," said the company's mobile chief Koh
Dong-jin in August. "We have improved product quality enough to expand curved
models."
