New Delhi, June 7 -- Zee Media Bureau
 Samsung launched Galaxy S7 Active in the US on Tuesday. It's a phone with
features which gives an impression that the device is all geared to foray into a
real time battlefield.


 The new launch has almost the same features as the flagship S7, but for the
rugged exterior.
 Interestingly, Samsung claims the S7 active passes the U.S. Military Standard
(MIL-STD) 810G tests for a "ruggedized phone", and can face exposure to high and
low temperatures, salt fog, humidity, and shock. The test includes dropping the
phone in different ways onto two inches of plywood over concrete from a height
of at least four feet.
 The phone has the latest Snapdragon 820 SoC with a quad-core CPU utilizing
Qualcomm's custom 64-bit Kryo cores and Adreno 530 GPU as the predecessor.
 This is paired with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 32GB of UFS 2.0 NAND. Additional
internal storage options are not available for the S7 active, but it still
supports microSD cards for expansion.
 S7 Active will be offered in Cammo Green, Titanium Gray, Sandy Gold. It will be
available for purchase online or in AT&T stores on June 10.
 It is priced at $26.50 for 30 months with an AT&T Next plan or $33.13 a month
for 24 months with an AT&T Next Every Year plan.
