year, and rumors around its next flagship Galaxy S7 have already started
building up.

The S7 is not expected to come out before early 2016, as it is touted to get a
Snapdragon 820 chipset. The phone might also come with three different chipsets
for different markets, but what's more exciting is that the Galaxy S7 might
sport a USB Type-C port too.

The 2016 Samsung flagship is tipped to get a USB Type-C port, but the people
atSamMobile have actually used the word "confirmed", thus hinting towards the
possibility that it might be a confirmed feature and not just a rumor. Anyway,
the inclusion of a USB Type-C port into its next flagship would be an obvious
move by Samsung, especially when the industry is evolving so fast and many
flagships already carry that feature.

The USB Type-C port is very convenient to use, thanks to the reversible design,
possible USB 3.1 support, speedier connections, high-wattage power delivery, the
ability to charge a smartphone from another, faster charging time, etc.

The Galaxy S7 has also been rumored to get a ClearForce technology made by
Synaptics, and this tech will be a rival to the 3D Touch by Apple. The next
flagship might also sport a new magnesium alloy body to improve the strength to
weight ratio, which will help Samsung take the lead in the competition.
