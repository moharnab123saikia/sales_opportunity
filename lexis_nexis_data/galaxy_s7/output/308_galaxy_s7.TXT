

Samsung Electronics Co.'s latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S7, may come
without mobile carriers' logos inscribed on the back, industry sources said
Tuesday, reflecting the firm's efforts to improve the aesthetics of its
smartphones.

According to the sources, the Galaxy S7 to be released in South Korea will not
come with mobile carriers' logo on the back, and also will delete "Samsung" from
the front of the phone above the screen.

Samsung Electronics' spokesperson declined to clarify whether the rumors are
true in South Korea as well as possible moves to extend this practice to the
global market.

Industry sources said there has been a growing need for a "clean" Galaxy
smartphone among Samsung fans, especially since main rival Apple Inc.'s iPhones
come without the brand name inscribed on it, except for the symbolic apple on
the back.

Samsung earlier said its latest metal-and-glass encased flagship devices will be
available for sale on March 11 in 60 countries around the globe. Preorders for
the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge will begin on March 4 in South Korea.
