its customers after the heat of Galaxy Note 7 explosions.

samsung's dream smartphone Galaxy Note 7 turned out to be a chunk of bad
experience after a number of units were reported to have exploded over a period
of time - some while charging and some while inside pockets. While the whole
world was baffled, Samsung didn't leave even a single chance to show its loyal
customers how much the company cares for them.

The company offered refunds to its Galaxy Note 7 users, exchanged Note 7 with
other premium smartphones like Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, and Note 5. We even received
a report stating that Samsung was present at a few airports to help flyers with
Galaxy Note 7 for an immediate solution, when the flight companies banned the
smartphone into the flight.

However, the recent reports claim that the company has introduced an upgrade
program where the Galaxy Note 7 users to exchange their smartphones to the
upcoming Galaxy S8 and Note 8 smartphones, that are expected to arrive next
year.

Adding on to this, Reuters recently reported that the new upgrade program is
currently rolled out for Galaxy Note 7 users in South Korea, which is the
company's home market. To apply for the upgrade program, customers will have to
trade in their Galaxy Note 7 device for either Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge. And,
when the company launches the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8, the users who have
applied for the upgrade program will just have to pay half the price of the
Galaxy S7 device. The last date to apply for this program is said to be Nov 30.

It is being said that the new upgrade program was the outcome of the
class-action lawsuit filed by 527 Galaxy Note 7 owners in South Korea against
the company. However, we still do not know whether this upgrade program will be
available in other markets as well.
