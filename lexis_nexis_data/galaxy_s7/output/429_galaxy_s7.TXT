

Samsung Electronics said Thursday its net profit advanced 13.55 percent on-year
to 5.25 trillion won ($4.56 billion) in the first quarter, on the back of brisk
sales of its latest flagship smartphones.

Sales gained 5.65 percent on-year to 49.7 trillion won, while operating profit
rose 11.65 percent to 6.67 trillion won, Samsung said in its regulatory filing.
The results were mostly in line with an earnings guidance released earlier this
month.

Samsung said its IT and mobile communications business posted an operating
profit of 3.89 trillion won, up 42 percent from a year earlier. The company
attributed the performance to the strong sales of the Galaxy S7 series, which
went on sale in March.

The tech firm has been suffering from the sluggish performance of its mobile
division, especially due to competition from Chinese rivals.

The company said the Galaxy S7 is gaining popularity around the globe, including
in North America and Europe.

The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge smartphones were first showcased at a trade
fair in Spain in February.

Samsung's chip business, which emerged as the firm's new main source of profit
for last year amid sagging smartphone sales, posted an operating profit of 2.63
trillion won, down 10 percent from the 2.93 trillion won posted a year earlier.
