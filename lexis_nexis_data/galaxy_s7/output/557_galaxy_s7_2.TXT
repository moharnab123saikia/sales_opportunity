Samsung's aggressive marketing is also playing a role in attracting new
customers.

The Gear Fit 2, worth 198,000 won (US$177), is offered as a gift for a new Note
purchase. The company pays 50 percent of the repair costs when the screen is
broken. A 100,000-won gift card is also given for use at Samsung Pay Mall.

Samsung operates some 2,800 Note experience zones across the nation, which
compares to some 2,000 for the Galaxy S7.

The company aims to attract premium customers before the upcoming launch of
Apple's next iPhone possibly in September.

The Galaxy Note 7 will be launched on Aug. 19 globally. The price starts from
988,900 won here.
