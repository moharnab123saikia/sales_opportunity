sales of the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge reach 15 million in the second
quarter of this year, industry sources said Thursday.

The sources estimate that Samsung's combined shipments of the Galaxy S7 and S7
Edge will hover at 15 million units in the April-June period. The two models
went on sales on March 11.

Noticeably, the sales of the Galaxy S7 Edge, which is more expensive, will beat
out the Galaxy S7, according to the sources.

The two latest models, first showcased at a trade fair in Spain in February,
come with improved batteries and are water and dust resistant. The company also
brought back the micro SD card slot that had disappeared in the Galaxy S6
series.

Meanwhile, several local securities companies earlier upgraded their
second-quarter earnings outlook for the tech behemoth. In a note to clients,
Hanwha Investment and Securities Co. predicted Samsung's operating profit will
soar to 7.7 trillion won ($6.67 billion) for the April-June period, bolstered by
strong sales of the Galaxy7 series.

"The profit rate of Samsung Electronics' smartphone business is to rise from
15.8 percent to 17.1 in the second quarter and Samsung's mobile segment will
reach 4 trillion won in terms of operating profits," said No Geung-chang, a
researcher at HMC Investment Securities. (Yonhap)
