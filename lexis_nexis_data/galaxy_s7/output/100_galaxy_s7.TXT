However, some T-Mobile customers who preordered the smartphones will get one by
February 29. With its new devices, Samsung is offering features that went
missing in its earlier models, Galaxy S6 and S6 edge.

The new version has glass and metal body, besides a microSD expansion slot,
removable battery and waterproof case. If a buyer preorders the mobiles on
T-Mobile, he will get the new gadgets even before the release date. Many of the
buyers have already received their notification that their mobile will be
delivered to them by February 29. It is not common for companies to provide
their consumers with devices well before release, but doing so 10 days before
the formal launch, might sound unusual.

Earlier this week, Samsung revealed that all those who preordered Galaxy S7 or
Galaxy S7 Edge will be given a free Gear VR headset along with a 6-game bundle,
which is $150 in value. It is not clear whether the offer is available for
buyers outside the United States. The cheapest way to buy the device is by
following contracts. One of the contracts is a 30-month contract for $23.17,
while other is a $26.50 per month from AT&T.;

It is said that Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge have 5.1 displays. The latter is
also similar to Galaxy S6 Edge in design, but is comparatively larger. It also
has curved screen OLED display. The screen for Galaxy S7 is 5.5 inch while the
same for Galaxy S7 Edge is larger, more than 5.5 inches. Both devices have same
2560x1440 resolutions with 535 pixels per inch.
