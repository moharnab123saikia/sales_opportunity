regional launch of Galaxy Note7 in Dubai.


Samsung has launched the all-new Galaxy Note7 in Dubai recently, described as
its 'most intelligent smartphone' ever.
The Note7 will be available in the region, including Qatar, from August 19 in
Gold Platinum, Silver Titanium and Black Onyx colours with a recommended retail
price of QR2,999. A 128GB microSD card will be supplied to complement the 64GB
of internal memory.


Similar to the S7 and S7 Edge, the new Android sensation features a
water-resistant body backed by an advanced S Pen (IP68) and equipped with an
advanced camera.
The dual-pixel sensor technology, wide aperture and fast auto focus, work
together to create sharp and beautiful photos even in low-light environments.


In a press statement, Samsung noted that the Note7 also features top-of-the-line
security that combines Samsung Knox with biometric authentication, including a
new iris scanning feature, and immersive entertainment features with HDR video
streaming capabilities.
"With the Note7 we have reinvented the large-screen smartphone segment with a
unique combination of productivity tools, entertainment services and security
features," Samsung Gulf Electronics' IT and Mobile Division head Tarek Sabbagh
said.
"In addition, the Note7 powers a robust ecosystem that strikes a balance between
work and play, enabling people to achieve more than what they thought possible
on a smartphone not just faster but wherever and whenever," he added.
Besides offering an expandable storage and microSD support up to 256GB,
Samsung's new smartphone is also equipped with a 3,500mAh battery, easy Power
Management, and charges quickly using the new USB-C port.
While with the enhanced S Pen, users can bring ideas to life the moment
inspiration strikes without unlocking the screen by using Screen off memo and
simply pinning the memo to the Always On Display.
The S Pen also gives users the ability to easily create and share GIF animations
with Smart Select.
In addition, the new Air Command functions, including Magnify and Translate,
enable users to zoom in on the screen or convert languages with a simple hover
of the S Pen.
It is even easier to access the best of the S Pen's creative abilities with
Samsung Notes, a new unified app allowing users to jot down handwritten notes,
draw, or edit memos from one location.
The smaller 0.7mm tip and improved pressure sensitivity provides a real pen-like
experience. Due to its IP68 water resistant certification, the Note7 S Pen lets
users jot down their thoughts without interruption, even when the screen gets
wet.  The Note7 features a gorgeous, curved 5.7-inch QHD Super Amoled screen
delivering a bold and immersive picture on a smartphone. It is ready to stream
HDR video, enabling a cinema-like experience including brighter colours and a
deeper black, which ensure users get the full experience that the filmmaker
intended.
For people who live to create, tell stories and transport people to entirely new
worlds, the Note7 can be used with the new high-resolution (3840x1920) Gear 360
camera, to capture, edit and share 360-degree images videos on the go. These
memories can then be shared with friends via platforms including YouTube 360 and
Facebook, and can be relived with the ultra-immersive Gear VR.
Samsung has partnered with Holiday Factory, the leading package tour operator in
the Middle East, to offer holiday packages on the basis of "Buy One Get One
Free".
The packages are inclusive of round trip tickets, hotel accommodation, airport
transfers and a dedicated tour guide- savings can be more than QR4,000 for Qatar
residents who can choose to travel to locations including Dubai and the
Maldives.
