Samsung is on a great run recently, with the launch of the two latest flagships,
the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the S7 Edge.

As reported by Reuters, Samsung's mobile chief, Dongjin Koh, recently stated
that the Korean company is having a much stronger rate of pre-orders than
expected. The report from Reuters stated "Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd
has seen stronger-than-expected preorders for its new flagship Galaxy S7
smartphones launching this week, a senior company executive said on Thursday."

However, Koh did not follow up on his statement with any specific sales figures
to back up these claims. However, he did state that Samsung hopes for a strong
performance from the Galaxy S7, which will help the company drive success in
regions like China, where it is facing massive competition.

The Samsung Galaxy S7 and the S7 Edge, are the latest flagships from Samsung,
and so far it seems to be doing quite well. The Samsung Galaxy S7 is available
for AED 2399, while the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is available for AE 2799. Both
the phones come with three color options, which includes Black, Gold and Silver.
