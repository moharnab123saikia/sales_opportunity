

LG's latest flagship phone, the G5 won't be revealed until February 21, however,
the company isn't letting that get in the way of showing off its accessories.

The LG Quick Cover has a semi-transparent mesh front that protects the handset's
display. However, it still allows the user to view important information, such
as time and date via a window and, impressively, to take or drop calls just by
touching the cover.

LG hasn't revealed much about what to expect from its latest phone other than it
will have an "always on" display. We'll have to wait until its official press
conference at the Mobile World Congress to find out more.
