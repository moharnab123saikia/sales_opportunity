The phrase "dual camera" is self explanatory, but why exactly are two cameras
better than one?

1. Smartphone cameras have a few inherent restrictions: not only are there other
internal components that require space of their own, reducing what manufacturers
can dedicate for imaging, but these cameras are also limited in comparison to
their digital counterparts.

2. Smartphone camera lenses cannot zoom, as there's no way to incorporate the
hardware necessary without a huge bump on the back panel. These lenses are
locked to a fixed focus, and digital zoom can only give you so much before
there's a serious tradeoff in quality. That's where one type of dual camera,
featured in the LG G5 for example, comes into play. The second camera is a wide
angle lens, allowing the user to capture more in the frame, while the primary
camera can grab details in closeups.

3. Another type, is like what the new Huawei P9 has. Both cameras are set behind
lenses that have the same focal length, but one has a full color sensor and the
other monochrome. The magic lies in the monochrome sensor--without a color
filter it can capture a higher dynamic range, resulting in brighter photos even
in dark conditions. Images from both sensors are automatically merged to create
a better lit, higher quality photo.
