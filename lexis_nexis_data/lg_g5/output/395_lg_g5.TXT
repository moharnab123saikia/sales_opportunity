Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas (USA), which opens Wednesday, January 6,
2016 are sleek TVs and Samsung's approach to the 12-inch tablet.

iLi
Japanese start-up Logbar presented iLi, a compact wearable device that can
translate any sentence spoken into its microphone into one of three languages
then deliver it back through an onboard speaker -- no Internet connection
required. As yet, the device only works with English, Japanese and Chinese.
French, Thai and Korean should follow soon.

Samsung TabPro S
Samsung has launched its first 12-inch tablet, the TabPro S, designed to rival
the Apple iPad Pro and the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. The tablet runs Windows 10
and ships with a removable keyboard. It's expected in stores from February 2016.

LG Signature G6
South Korean manufacturer LG has caused something of a stir with its G6, a
77-inch 4K TV with an OLED screen that's just 2.57mm thick. While paving the way
for super-slim designs, OLED technology also ensures higher levels of brightness
than classic LCD screens. Note that LG has 65-inch and 55-inch (LG G5) models
also on show at CES. The Signature G6 is due out in March 2016.

Acer Chromebase 24
It may look like an iMac wannabe, but Acer's new Chromebase 24 brings a 2016
revamp to the firm's Chromebook range of PCs running Chrome OS and developed in
partnership with Google. With its 23.8-inch display (1920 x 1080 pixels), this
all-in-one computer has 8GB of RAM, four microphones and an HD webcam. The
Chromebase 24 is currently being previewed at CES, and is lined up to launch in
Q1 2016.

Casio WSD-F10 Smart Outdoor
Casio has unveiled its first Android smartwatch at this year's CES. It's aimed
primarily at hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts, boasting resistance to water,
dust and vibrations. It's expected to land in spring 2016 priced around $500
(approx. [#x20ac]465).
