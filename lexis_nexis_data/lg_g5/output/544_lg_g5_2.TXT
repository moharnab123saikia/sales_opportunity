LG has given up on its modular accessories meant for its flagship smartphone G5.
However, Motorola is still trying hard to make its MotoMods work. In a latest
initiative, the Lenovo's subsidiary is encouraging fans to submit the ideas for
MotoMods. If your idea is really interesting, there is a good chance that it
will be financed through Indiegogo.

Finalists will be selected by our judging panel of industry leaders. You will
receive Moto Z and an MDK for free from Motorola. The lucky winners will also
receive a trip to Chicago to meet with Moto Mods executive development team.
This will be an important step in bringing your idea to life. Apart from this,
the company will also be hosting a Moto Mods hackathons in the U.S. The first
hackathon will be in New York in December. Those who successfully creates a Moto
Mods will also get an opportunity to participate in the Indiegogo campaign. For
more information and to register, visit modthefuture.com. If your idea is great
and somehow doesn't land up on Indiegogo, you might get funding from Lenovo
Capital, which has set aside up to $1 million. To be eligible for this, you need
to have a working prototype though.

If you too have a great idea for Moto Mods, head over to this link and share it
with Lenovo. So far, Motorola has unveiled Moto Mods that turn your phone into a
camera, a movie projector, a speaker, and an extra battery pack.
