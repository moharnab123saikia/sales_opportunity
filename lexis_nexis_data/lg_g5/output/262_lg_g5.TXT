its cross-town rival Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 7 recall on the sales of
the company's new big-screen phone V20.

"I'm not sure whether the Galaxy Note 7 recall is a boon for us or not. What's
important is how our product is recognized by consumers," he said at the phone's
launch event held in Seoul on Sept. 7.

The V series phablet debuted last year to comprise LG's premium smartphone
lineup together with the flagship G series.

The V20, the first smartphone to run on the latest Android OS Nougat, has
drastically upgraded audio and camera functions, the company said.

The phone, among other things, has a removable battery, a unique feature now
when most handset makers like Samsung and Apple are embedding non-removable
batteries into their flagship models.

"We had planned a bigger-screen smartphone with slim design. Considering a huge
battery drain while watching videos, we have decided to adopt a removable
battery," he said.

"But I don't think battery type is directly linked to safety."

Samsung recalled about 2.5 million Note phones globally due to faulty batteries
that caught fire while charging.

The latest LG smartphone comes after the dismal failure of the flagship G5, the
first modular smartphone. Especially, the company failed to meet demand in the
early days of the launch due to production constraints.

"For the V20, we poured resources to increase the yield rate. Unlike the G5 that
was launched globally, the V20 will be launched in some key markets for
big-screen phones such as the US, Korea and Hong Kong," he said.

He added the company had no immediate plan to launch the phone in China, the
world's largest smartphone market, citing supply issues.
