of the latest Android-powered flagship handsets -- the HTC 10 and the LG G5 --
are not compliant with the USB Type-C specification.

According to Leung, the HTC 10 and the LG G5 handsets are equipped with
Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 technology which violates the USB Type-C
specification that has essentially been designed to make things easier and
faster. A non-compliance with the specification can apparently put smartphones
at a potential risk of catching fire.

Leung has explained that, as per the USB Type-C 3.1 specification, the range of
the Vbus line of the port should be between 4.45 and 5.25 volts. However, the
specification of the port is violated by Qualcomm's Quick Charge technology
because it increases the voltage to 9 or 12 volts.

Leung has warned: "I don't recommend any Qualcomm QC 3.0 USB type-C charger,
because any of them that claim to support QC 3.0 on a Type-C port violates the
Type-C specification. The Type-C spec specifically forbids proprietary charging
methods that try to change Vbus beyond 5V."

Leung has also pointed out the HTC 10 and the LG G5 handsets are not the only
smartphones which are non-compliant with the USB Type-C specification.
