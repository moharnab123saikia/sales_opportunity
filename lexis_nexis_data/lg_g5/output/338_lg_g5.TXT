LG simple can't wait to show off their new smartphones at this year's MWC.
Shortly after announcing that LG will be releasing the LG X Cam and LG X Screen,
the Korean company has announced the LG Stylus 2, a sequel to the popular LG G4
Stylus, or the G4 Stylo.

This variation of the LG G4 sacrificed the top notch camera of the G4, but in
turn bumped the screen size up from 5.5 inches to 5.7 inches, and included a
stylus for note taking and doodles. The sequel, the LG Stylus 2, comes with the
same 5.7 inch display and a 13MP camera on the back and an 8MP camera on the
front. However, the new version will be smaller than its predecessor, being only
7.4mm thick and weighing just 145g.

The stylus in the LG Stylus 2 will be thinner, and have a nano-coated tip
fitted. According to the company, this nano-coating, "not only gives a real
pen-like feel," but also "allows for more accuracy when note taking and drawing
compared to a rubber-tipped pen." Once the stylus is removed, the screen
automatically shows a Pen Pop menu, with shortcuts for memo writing or scanning
apps.

The LG Stylus 2 will be revealed at the MWC next week along with the LG G5 and
the LG X Cam and LG X Screen.
