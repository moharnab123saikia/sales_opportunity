will likely miss the market consensus due to the lackluster sales performance of
its partners that include U.S.-based Apple and LG Electronics, according to an
investment report.

The Seoul-based LG Group affiliate is expected to post an operating loss of 20.4
billion won (US$17.4 million), far below the average of 10.8 billion won in
operating profit forecast by a group of investment firms, according to Hana
Financial Investment in its recent report.

LG Innotek's second-quarter revenue will likely decline 10 percent, compared to
the preceding quarter, the report said.

Handset makers such as Apple and LG that LG Innotek supplies to have been seeing
sluggish sales of their respective phones, the iPhone and the G5.

However, analysts said LG Innotek will see its earnings soar in the latter half
of this year thanks to the anticipated supply of its dual-lens camera, as rumor
has it, to Apple.

"LG Innotek will gain growth momentum with the supply of its dual-lens cameras
in the second half this year. Its optical solution business' revenue in 2017 is
forecast to increase 11 percent compared to this year with its operating profit
jumping by 212 percent," said Kim Ro-ko, a Hana Financial Investment analyst.
