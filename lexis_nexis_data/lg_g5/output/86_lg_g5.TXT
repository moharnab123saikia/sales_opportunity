The LG G5 is all set to launch at the MWC 2016, and although we still haven't
seen any official images of it, a new official Quick Cover case has emerged, and
it does look pretty.

The new form-fitting case wraps the G5 phone in a semitransparent mesh metal,
which leaves tiny openings through which to see incoming call notifications.
Similar to the LG K10 Quick Cover View, calls can be answered by swiping on the
cover itself, without having to flip open the protective cover. The phone will
respond to touch even when it is closed.

From the image of the cover, we can see that there is a huge cutout at the top
for the newly announced LG G5 always on display, that will act as a second
screen. This second screen will display time, date and up to four notification
icons.

According to an official press release the Quick Cover case uses a unique film
and glossy metallic finish for a smooth and luxurious look to complement the LG
G5, tipping that the phone might be made of metal, as opposed to the G4, which
was made of plastic with a metallic finish.

Price and availability of the Quick Cover case is yet to be revealed.
