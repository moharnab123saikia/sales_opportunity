

LG Electronics will collaborate with Danish premium audio business Bang &
Olufsen (B&O) for its new â[#x20ac]oeV20â[#x20ac] smartphone.

The electronics company has previously worked with B&O to develop a portable
digital-to-analog converter (DAC) module, â[#x20ac]oeLG Hi-Fi Plus,â[#x20ac] for
its flagship G5 smartphone.

Wednesdayâ[#x20ac][TM]s announcement came as LG is expanding partnerships with
globally renowned audio makers such as B&O and Harman Group to strengthen the
image of its brand as a provider of premium audio experiences.

â[#x20ac]oeCustomers are increasingly demanding high standards on smartphone
audio functions,â[#x20ac] LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company President
Cho Juno said. â[#x20ac]oeV20 will be a product that provides the best audio
experience.â[#x20ac]

Under the partnership, LG Electronics will work with the Danish
companyâ[#x20ac][TM]s sub-brand unit, B&O Play, to develop sound technologies
and devices. While B&O has established a solid reputation for luxury audio
devices and systems, B&O Play provides relatively smaller, portable devices for
the younger generation.

The two businesses will also jointly develop and bundle earphones for the V20,
from design to tuning, LG Electronics said.

â[#x20ac]oeWe believe that this collaboration will be a good opportunity to
incorporate acoustic technologies and design expertise that B&O has accumulated
over the last 90 years into the V20,â[#x20ac] B&O Play CEO Henrik Taudorf
Lorensen said.
