including America and Asia will soon receive the update, in few weeks down the
line.

LG has recently announced the roll out of Android 7.0 Nougat update to its
smartphone, G5.

According to a recent post on GSMArena, the update seems to be currently
available only for those users based in South Korea, the home country of LG.
However, other countries including America and Asian region will most likely be
receiving the update in the a few weeks down the line.

Adding more on to this, a recent post on Android Central informs that the
announcement from LG was out on the same day when Samsung's beta program for
testing Nougat on Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge was announced.

Having said this, this definitely seems to be a great announcement for the G5
users, after almost a year now.

Apparently, a recent Tech Times report mentioned that a two year old LG G3 to
have been spotted on GeekBench with Android Nougat. This definitely gives the LG
users a clearly idea that the company is working on providing the latest
operating system to even a smartphone that is two year old, which is not
commonly seen nowadays.
