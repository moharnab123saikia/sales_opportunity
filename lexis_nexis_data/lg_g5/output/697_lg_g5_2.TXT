sport 6GB of RAM, and that is a ton of memory in a smartphone

OnePlus has developed a liking for releasing more than one flagship model, and
this approach was taken with the company's OnePlus 2. Now, it appears that the
same business model is going to be used in releasing OnePlus 3, which is the
name expected to be present on the company's next flagship phone. According to
the latest images leak, OnePlus 3 is going to sport 6GB of RAM, and just to
break it down for you, flagship phones like Galaxy S7 and several others still
feature 4GB of RAM, so looking at a Chinese company releasing something like
this will definitely give us goosebumps and get us excited too.

Since all OnePlus smartphones released till now have featured a Qualcomm
chipset, the hardware sheet shows no difference in that trend because OnePlus 3
will most definitely be running a Snapdragon 820. According to The Next Rex,
phones like Xiaomi Mi5 feature a Kryo processor running at different speeds and
as you move up the price bracket, that processor is running at full speeds. We
believe that OnePlus 3 is going to follow the same approach and while most
consumers will not feel a tingle of a performance when it comes to their own
personal experience, there are those who want the best possible scores from
benchmarking applications.

However, having 6GB of RAM might be useful for a variety of different
applications, it will also be a battery guzzler, so we sincerely hope that
OnePlus has kept this drawback in mind and have made a list of plans to counter
it, and we hope that on the top of their list will be a huge battery capacity.
While no pricing details have been made available at this point, OnePlus 3 will
definitely be an affordable product in comparison to the likes of Galaxy S7, LG
G5 and HTC 10.

Unfortunately, we neither know when it is officially going to be announced, but
we should be looking at the third quarter of this year. Who knows, perhaps
OnePlus might even release a less performing model later down the road as it did
with its OnePlus X.
