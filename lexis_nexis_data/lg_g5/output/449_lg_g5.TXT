using a pair of room-scanning beacons to turn any area into a fully immersive
virtual reality playground. It's the sort of tech that has to be seen to be
believed. This year's MWC brought news that the HTC Vive will come with a hefty
$800 price tag and will ship in April.

LG ROLLING BOT Alongside announcing its new flagship G5 phone, LG showed off a
prototype of its adorable new spherical friend, the Rolling Bot. A home
protecting, wi-fi enabled butler buddy, its usefulness seems limited to:
tripping up less popular family members, stressing out pets, and being stomped
to death by totally unfazed burglars.

ORAL-B GENIUS On the list of household objects that don't need to be connected
to the internet, the toothbrush is right up there. But if you're concerned that
you might not be brushing properly, why not try the Oral-B Genius, an electric
toothbrush that asks you to mount your phone the bathroom mirror to monitor you
while you scrub those molars.
