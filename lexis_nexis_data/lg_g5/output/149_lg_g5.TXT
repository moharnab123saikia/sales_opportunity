New Delhi, Jan. 14 -- Zee Media Bureau
 Though the much awaited Mobile World Congress (MWC) is yet a couple of weeks
away, electronics manufacturer LG has already started sending official press
invites for its launch event.


 This is fuelling speculations that LG might unveil the G5 phablet during the
event.
 The invites sent out by LG says "Play Begins" at 2pm on February 21. The LG G4
was touted as one of the best phablets of 2015 with a wonderful screen and
fantastic camera specifications..
 As per media reports LG wants to keep this feature for the next phone, but
integrate the battery into a sliding modular shell so that the handset can be
formed from quality materials.
 Other reports say that the G5 will use a dual rear-camera set-up comprising two
16-megapixel lenses. The 5.3-inch QHD display will be joined by a second strip
display (think news ticker) that could display notifications.
 LG might also add a fingerprint sensor to this handset.
