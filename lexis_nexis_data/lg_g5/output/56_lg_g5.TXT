(MWC) 2016 trade show in Barcelona, Spain, on Sunday, was South Korean device
maker LG's new flagship handset --- G5.

The LG G5 was, by far, the most innovative new flagship device to be introduced
at the trade show this year. The G5 handset features a complete redesign of the
current LG flagship, the G4. Boasting an all-metal design, the newly-unveiled G5
is 159-gram handset which measures 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7 mm.

The LG G5 is scheduled to hit the US markets in April; and will be available
from Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and Best Buy. LG will offer four color options for
the handset --- Silver, Gold, Titan, and Pink.

Some of its most impressive specifications include a 5.3-inch IPS LCD QHD
'Always-On' display with 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution; Qualcomm's newest
Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor; 4GB of RAM; a removable 2,800 mAh battery;
and 32GB of onboard storage capacity, which can be expanded to 200GB via a
microUSB card. The handset runs the Android OS 6.0 'Marshmallow' version; and is
equipped with a 16-megapixel main rear camera; and an 8-megapixel front-facing
camera.

The most distinguishing feature of the G5 is that it enables users to benefit
from different 'modules' which can be used for the handset by sliding out its
battery. Among the modules available for use in G5, one of the modules adds a
bigger battery and camera controls; while another one offers better sound
quality.
