LG has a habit of taking the stage at the annual CES show in Las Vegas over the
past two years, revealing the G Flex and G Flex 2 earlier. This year however, we
might not be hearing anything about the LG G Flex 3.

With CES 2016 only a few weeks away, there hasn't been any official story on the
LG G Flex 3, and we might not even hear anything about it during the event.
According to Media Daum, a Korean news website, LG might reportedly get rid of
the phone all together. Although this is still a rumor at this point, there is
still no news on why LG would cancel the G Flex series, even when its other
flagships are not exactly selling well. One possibility is that LG would want to
focus more on a device that can compete long term with the Samsung Galaxy S6 or
iPhone 6s, rather than devices that have a short lived novelty to them.

However, the report also mentions that LG will be unveiling the LG G5 in April
next year, as well as a successor to the LG V10 in the second half of 2016. If
the report is true, the LG G5 might be sporting a Snapdragon 820 CPU, Adreno 530
GPU with a 5.6 inch 2K display with a 21MP camera. It might also come with an
iris scanner or at least a finger scanner.

Last year LG had an amazing stall at CES having the only new handset by a major
company and grabbed majority of the spotlight, let's hope LG can pull off
something similar this year as well.
