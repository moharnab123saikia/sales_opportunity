While everyone waits for the LG G5 to be announced at MWC 2016 in a few days,
rumors and leaks are all over the place. However, in a surprising turn of
events, the LG G5 was available for sale on Dubizzle, one of the largest
e-commerce websites in Dubai.

Yesterday an interesting leak showed that an LG G5 unit was up for sale on
Dubizzle. Someone had allegedly got hold of an LG G5 unit imported from the USA
days before its official release and put it up for sale in the UAE for a price
of AED 2500, which is roughly $680. The description of the phone said that the
phone is in perfect condition inside and out and is listed as brand new.

We still cannot confirm the legitimacy of these pictures, but the pictures do
look like the actual phone. It comes with its metal body, which the G5 is
rumored to have, as well as the rear positioned circular fingerprint scanner
that has been seen on all previous leaks of the phone. The images also show the
dual camera setup at the back of the phone as well as the side positioned volume
rocker, which stays true to the previous leaks of the LG G5. It is still not
clear if there is a second screen similar to the V10, but rumors suggest that it
will, along with a removable battery module.

This might be the most legit LG G5 leak so far. The phone has been removed from
the website.
