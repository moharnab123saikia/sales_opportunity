The LG G5 is almost here, and we are just a week away from its official look at
G5. However, key details of the phone have emerged.

According to the reliable leakster Evan Blass, the LG G5 will come with a
secondary screen. He did not reveal the size, location or purpose of the
secondary screen, but claims to have seen the G5 for himself making it a good
chance that this might be true.

LG has used a second screen earlier on the LG V10, with a small 2.1 inch display
at the top giving the user quick and easy access to notifications and apps.
There is a chance that the second screen on the LG G5 might be for the same
purpose. Blass also suggested that the G5 may come with an extra camera or lens
at the back camera. He mentions that the LG G5 might have a wide angle dual lens
camera on the back, like the LG X Cam.

It is still unclear for what the extra lens will be used. It could be used to
have each lens at a different focal length, allowing optical zooming, or it
could be used to simple adjust the focus of a shot after taking it, similar to
the HTC One M8.

The LG G5 is shaping up to be a pretty powerful phone. Earlier rumors suggest
that it may come with a metal shell, a removable battery, a Snapdragon 820
processor and 4GB of RAM as well. Its just a matter of waiting to see if the G5
will be able to compete with other major reveals during MWC 2016.
