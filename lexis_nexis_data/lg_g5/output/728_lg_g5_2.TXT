as the coolest colour for everything from phones to keyboards - even the
Blackberry has gone all virginal. This week, BONNIE ESTRIDGE finds the best ones
around

BEST GIRLIE E-MAILER White Blackberry Pearl, free on contract.

Stockists: 0845 412 2401/www.t-mobile. co. uk This new white version comes
complete with glowing "pearl" (actually a rollerball for navigating the menu).
Has an MP3 player and camera and although the QWERTY keyboard is small and
fiddly, this is a must-have for fashionistas who want to show off their
e-mailer.

BEST POCKET SAT-NAV Mio H610, GBP 300.

Stockists: 08453 45 42 45/www. mio-tech. be Pretty pocket-sized satnav with an
MP3 player, photo viewer and games. Has good, clear mapping and preloaded speed
camera warnings with free updates for one year. Small and slightly fiddly with a
2.7in display, its trendy white, interchangeable bezel makes a change from the
usual sober style.

BEST LOVELY LAPTOP MacBook G5, GBP 749.

Stockists: 0800 039 1010/ www. apple. com/uk Great price for a cool laptop with
all the features of its more expensive rivals - and it looks terrific too. The
13.3in widescreen basic version has 512MB memory, 60GB hard drive, a speedy
Intel Core 2 Duo processor and some great software - making it an excellent buy.

BEST COOL KEYBOARD Logitech S 530 Cordless Desktop for Mac, GBP 69.99.

2.1in colour display. Easy to use with neat vertical touch-pad.

BEST DESKTOP DISTRACTION LaCie Stack & Play Brick Mobile Hard Drive, GBP 85.90.

Stockists: 020 7017 0040/www. lacie. com Is it a Lego brick? No, it's a 120GB
hard drive but the 5.1 x 4.4in bricks stack so you can expand the capacity by
adding more in different colours.

BEST FOR TEENAGE DJs Hercules Mobile DJ MP3, GBP 59.

Stockists: 020 7556 7843/www. amazon. co. uk Wannabee "bedroom" DJs and
composers will love this tiny mixer which transmits tracks from a computer to
the 6.8 x 6in console and then back to the computer for burning CDs. It has two
decks, a good-sized display and can be used for live mixes at parties with a
laptop.

BEST TASTY PHONE LG White Chocolate, from free on contract, and payas-you-go
from GBP 119.95.

Stockists: Carphone Warehouse, 0800 925 925/ www. carphonewarehouse. com Who
knows what chocolate has to do with this phone, except that it looks delicious.

are being used and fade into the background when they're not needed. Has an MP3
player, 1.3 megapixel camera, games and all the usual functions.

a very good little camera at a great price.
