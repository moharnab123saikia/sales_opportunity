

But just in South Korea for now

LG G5 users can rejoice! You are also getting Android 7.0 Nougat.

Starting today, LG G5 users in South Korea will be getting the update to Android
7.0 Nougat. Since South Korea is home turf for LG, it is no surprise that they
get it first, which will soon be followed by an international release.
Curiously, LG didnt bother to label the UK or Europe in general in today's press
release, opting to use the word "other markets." That's on top of not bothering
to launch the LG V20 in the UK

The LG G5 might also get some performance upgrades with the Android 7.0 Nougat
OS. This includes a more streamlined UI for speed and convenience. Searches, for
example, happen across user-install apps, not just pre-installed ones. Users
will also get the new multi window experience to switch between apps, which can
also run side by side. Users will also get nested notifications as well.

As mentioned, the update is only for South Korea as of now, but we can expect an
OTA update internationally soon.
