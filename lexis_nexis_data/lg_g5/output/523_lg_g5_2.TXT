BuzzFeed will attend the MWC event in Barcelona.

Mobile World Congress (MWC) sees the biggest names in telecoms head to Barcelona
for the industry's annual trade fair, unveiling new technologies and sharing
their visions of the sector's future. It looks like Mark Zuckerberg is once
again set to steal the limelight at the 2016 event.

As well as presenting new mobile handsets and connected devices, Mobile World
Congress hosts conferences uniting the movers and shakers of the telecoms
industry (product manufacturers, network providers, ISPs, etc.).

After having already appeared at the 2015 event, where he talked about
Facebook's mobile strategy, Mark Zuckerberg will once again be the star of the
show at MWC this year. He'll be appearing alongside a whole host of industry
CEOs already confirmed for the show, including Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Hans
Vestberg of Ericsson, Shang Bing of China Mobile, Vittorio Colao of Vodafone,
Brian Krzanich of Intel, Dan Schulman of PayPal and Jonah Peretti of BuzzFeed.

Most of the keynotes will be streamed live online via a special internet
channel. Several key moments will also be shown on Mobile World Live TV,
broadcast at the salon and in surrounding locations such as partner hotels.
