giant is preparing to reduce about 1,000 employees at its struggling mobile
business division.

"We are relocating some employees to other business divisions as disclosed in
May, but we are not considering cutting any jobs," an LG Electronics
spokesperson told The Investor, a new online business news site recently
launched by The Korea Herald.

"Some hundreds of workers have been relocated on a regular basis," he added,
saying related works are still ongoing and no specifics have been decided yet.

On Thursday, News 1, a local news agency, reported that LG's mobile business
division would be downsizing to improve profitability. Apart from premium lines
such as the V and G series, some hundreds of budget phone lineups are expected
to be drastically reduced, the report said.

In May, LG Electronics CEO and mobile chief Cho Juno unveiled the reshuffle plan
in an emailed message to employees. He also made it clear that there would be no
restructuring against individual employees' wills.

"We need to change the way we work to move faster and lighter," the company's
CEO and mobile chief Cho Juno said in an email message to employees Monday.

"Other business divisions also need people from MC (mobile communications). We
will continue to reshuffle personnel."

The division has struggled from operating losses since the failure of its
flagship smartphone G4 last year. The company relocated 15 to 20 percent of its
total workforce.

In its first-quarter earnings report in April, the company said it could see a
turnaround in the second quarter when G5 shipment starts to be reflected in
sales. In the quarter, the company posted an operating loss of 202.2 billion won
($173 million).

The company has forecast it will sell 3 million units of the G5 phone in the
second quarter, but industry watchers are skeptical about the sales target.
