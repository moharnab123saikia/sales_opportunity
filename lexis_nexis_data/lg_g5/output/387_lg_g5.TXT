

The first major smartphones of 2016 are set to be announced today as the Mobile
World Congress (MWC) begins in Barcelona.

LG, Huawei and Samsung all hold press events ahead of the doors of the
technology show opening to the public on Monday, with new flagship devices
likely to be announced by all three firms.

LG is preparing to unveil the G5, its flagship smartphone. The Korean firm has
already been mentioning the device on social media, confirming it will come with
an "always-on" screen and revealing a smart case for it.

More details will be announced at its press conference on Sunday afternoon.

Fellow Korean manufacturer Samsung is expected to announce the next generation
of its Galaxy S handset - expected to be the S7 - which should follow the
all-metal design Samsung introduced in the S6 last year.

The MWC has become a key smartphone event in the technology calendar, with
hundreds of accessories shown off for the first time alongside the new devices,
as well as future technologies being broadly discussed.

This year is expected to see discussion on 5G internet - the next generation of
wireless data for phones which will bring faster internet speeds to mobile
devices - which could arrive by 2017.

Around 90,000 people are expected at the four-day technology show, which runs
until Thursday.

Chinese firm Huawei is also due to announce a series of new products, with
reports suggesting it could unveil a new laptop and smartwatch as well as a
successor to their P8 smartphone.

Though it is not holding a press conference, Taiwanese technology giant HTC is
also due to make an announcement.

The firm's first virtual reality headset, the HTC Vive, is due to go on sale in
April and more details could also be shared on the upcoming launch.
