LG recently confirmed that the LG G5, the latest flagship, will be launched on
the February 21 in Barcelona. However, it might not just be the G5.

It wasn't much of a surprise when LG announced the date, mainly because of the
"save the date" notice that LG sent out three weeks back. LG has managed to keep
the G5 behind locked doors for a while, but a few leaks have sprung. The phone
is rumored to be coming with a full metal body, dual cameras, USB Type-C, rear
mounted fingerprint sensor and a volume rocker which has been moved back to the
side of the phone. It will also come with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the
box.

LG also shared an image as part of the invite which reads "Come meet new friends
on the playground", which according to the writers at TechRadar seems to be
implying a new VR system from LG. The three characters on the invite are a
robot, biplane and a wizard goldfish, however, it is highly unlikely that LG has
been working on something with robotics. We know that LG will be releasing two
flagships this year, but both together might not be a smart move.
