If you are a holder of an Asus device, and you are expecting a Marshmallow
update soon, you just have to wait till sometime in Q2 (April - June).

Asus is always a bit late when it comes to Android updates, and it looks like
this situation won't change for a few months. Asus recently took to its forums
to announce the list of devices that will receive the Android 6.0 Marshmallow
update sometime in Q2, which is in between April and June. This list includes
Asus's 2015 ZenFones, as well as the PadFone S transformer.

The devices that will get the update are the Asus PadFone S (PF500KL), ZenFone 2
(ZE550ML, ZE551ML), ZenFone 2 Deluxe (ZE551ML), ZenFone 2 Deluxe Special Edition
(ZE551ML), ZenFone 2 Laser (ZE500KG, ZE500KL, ZE550KL, ZE551KL, ZE600KL,
ZE601KL), ZenFone Selfie (ZD551KL), ZenFone Max (ZC550KL) and the ZenFone Zoom
(ZX551ML).

Asus did not mention what the updates would bring to the table, but we can be
sure that changes will include Asus's own Mail, Calendar and Messenger apps
being replaced by the Google counterparts. However, the Asus apps will still be
available for download through the Play Store. This was also a similar step
taken by Samsung who famously killed off several of its own apps and services
ahead of the release of the Samsung S6, as well as LG who did the same for the
G5.
