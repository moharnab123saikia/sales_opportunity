the rollout of its Android 7.0 Nougat preview. And although the search giant has
not yet mentioned when it will be rolling out the final consumer version to
users, a Canadian carrier seems to have spilled the beans regarding the same.
According to Canadian carrier Telus, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P will receive
Android 7.0 Nougat starting August 22. The news comes from the carrier's
software update list.

The update is likely to roll out over-the-air, meaning that unlocked and
carrier-free Nexus devices would get the final Android 7.0 updates slightly
earlier.Recently it was reported that the upcoming OS version of Android will
include enhanced Data Saver option that will enable users to set up warning and
halt limits, making it easy to manage mobile data allowances. It will also let
users provide unrestricted data access to certain apps. If that's not
intelligent enough, Android Nougat will make Data Saver smarter.It has been
mentioned that the Data Saver option in Android 7.0 Nougat will enable
unrestricted network access to apps, for users with unlimited data plans. That
said, it will restrain internet access to the apps for users with limited data
plans. These changes were indicated in the ConnectivityManager API in Android
Nougat's SDK.The new data saving features will work even if users are travelling
abroad and buy prepaid local sim cards. The amount of data used by background
processes will also be managed by the improved Data Saver option.Slowly,
smartphone manufacturers have started rolling out beta programmes for Android N.
Recently, LG started the rollout of the Android N preview programme for users of
its G5 smartphone users. The programme is currently available only in Korea on
the LG U+ network, and will enable users to experience Android 7.0 Nougat early.
