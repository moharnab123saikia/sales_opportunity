While everyone is busy running behind the Samsung Galaxy S7 or the LG G5, a new
leak for a Sony Xperia phone is out.

Thanks to leakster Evan Blass, aka @evleaks, Sony might be working on a new
Xperia phone, called the PP10. It is to be confirmed if PP10 is its actual name,
as Evan suggests that it could be a codename or retail branding. Evan leaked a
photo, in which we can see that the Xperia PP10 comes with a metallic looking
black body, that could be either metal or plastic with a metallic finish, and
average camera and LED flashlight and a likely fingerprint sensor under the
power button, similar to the Z5.

Tipped as the "Xperia PP10"
