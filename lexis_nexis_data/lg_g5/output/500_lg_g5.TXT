traditional point- and-shoot digital camera. It adds on a camera grip and zoom
wheel, as well as physical shutter, launch and record buttons.

The module itself is quite basic, with a flat, grey textured plastic handgrip
that covers about a third of the phone.

It is meant to be used with the phone in landscape mode, with the shutter and
record buttons on the top, the zoom wheel at the corner and the launch button on
the right.

While the additional grip does make the phone a little easier to handle with one
hand, it is not particularly ergonomic as it is completely flat, and reaching
the launch button during one-handed usage is a little tricky.

All the buttons are responsive, and the launch button works even when the phone
is locked.

However, I found that because of the low profile of the buttons and the very
smooth scrolling on the zoom wheel, there was very little tactile feedback
overall, and often I had to wait for an on-screen response to know if I had
pressed a button or not.

Its 1,200mAh battery also needs to be charged separately, and cannot draw power
from the G5 if it is flat.
