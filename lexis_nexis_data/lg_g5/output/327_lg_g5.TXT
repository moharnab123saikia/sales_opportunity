

New rumors suggest LG will be releasing its next flagship smartphone early
September.

According to Korean website ETNews, LG is busy prepping the successorÂ to last
year's critically hit V10 smartphone.

Sources close to the website claims that LG's next will be called V20, as
opposed to V11, and will release early September. The phone was initially
scheduled for a late September to October release, but LG wants to make it
during the Fall season for better sales opportunity. This means that LG will be
going up against Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and the iPhone 7, both of which are
expected to release this Fall as well.

One of the reasons LG wants to do an early release is because it wants users to
forget about the G5, which was failure in terms of sales, and shift focus on a
brand new smartphone. We don't know what kind of hardware the V20 will pack, but
expect to hear more about it pretty soon.
