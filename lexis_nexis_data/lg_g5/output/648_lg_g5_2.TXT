device.

QuadRooter, a malware that targets four specific vulnerabilities in Android
smartphones, has been the latest and greatest threat to the platform. Thanks to
Qualcomm hardware exploits, with approximately 900 million devices at risk, the
malware is capable of gaining root access to a person's smartphone. However, it
looks like there might be some reprieve after all.

Google has announced that Google Play's "Verify Apps" feature automatically
blocks all apps with a possible QuadRooter exploit from installing. Verify Apps
is avilable on Android devices running version 4.2 Jelly Bean or above, which
Google says is about 90.6 percent of devices that visit its Play Store. What the
security feature does is that scans an app for a malware exploit, and blocks it
from installing if detected. The feature is enabled by default and, the company
claims, is likely to be enough to safeguard your phone for now.

In a statement to Android Central, a Google spokesperson said, "We appreciate
Check Point's research as it helps improve the safety of the broader mobile
ecosystem. Android devices with our most recent security patch level are already
protected against three of these four vulnerabilities. The fourth vulnerability,
CVE-2016-5340, will be addressed in an upcoming Android security bulletin,
though Android partners can take action sooner by referencing the public patch
Qualcomm has provided."

Some devices that might be vulnerable to QuadRooter include the Google Nexus 5X
and Nexus 6P, HTC 10, LG G5, OnePlus 3, Moto X, Galaxy S7, and the BlackBerry
Priv. Even the supposedly secure Blackphone is at risk, experts say.
