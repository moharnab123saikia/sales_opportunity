With the announcement of Android Nougat, rumors have already started spreading
about the new Nexus devices, which even includes a fairly comprehensive spec
listing.

The next Nexus phone, dubbed the Nexus M1 or the HTC Marlin, is said to be a
powerful device with flagship performance, and the benchmark spotted does seem
to prove it. Recently, a phone listed Google Marlin was put to the test on
Geekbench, achieving a single core score of 2084 and a multi core score of 4969.
This puts it quite ahead of the iPhone 6s and the HTC 10, 4417 and 4962 multi
core score respectively, which are both powerful devices.

However, this is not the most powerful of devices tested on Geekbench. LG G5
managed to get 5386, the Snapdragon 820 edition of the Samsung S7 scored 5398
and the Exynos edition of the S7 scored 6542.

From the leaked benchmark result, the Nexus M1 is rumored to be running Android
Nougat with 4GB RAM and a quad core processor. The score suggests that it might
be the Snapdragon 820, but there are rumors that the Marlin could feature the
Snapdragon 821 or Snapdragon 823, which on paper would be an improvement on most
of 2016's flagships.

Both the new Nexus devices, this one and the mid range HTC Sailfish are expected
to launch in September.
