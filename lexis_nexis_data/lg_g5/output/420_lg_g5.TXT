The two tech giants are in fierce competition in the Korean market and have been
rolling out a range of products including smartphones, TVs, and refrigerators.

Most recently, the rivals have been trying to take the lead in emerging tech
segments such as virtual reality.

Samsung released its VR headset Gear VR in partnership with Facebook-owned
Oculus last year and an accompanying 360-degree camera earlier this year.

Not to be outdone, LG rolled out a series of products, called Friends, earlier
this year. The Friends lineup consists of a mini drone, a rolling robot as well
as a VR headset and a 360-camera. More Friends products will be rolled out down
the road.

Samsung said visitors to the trade show can experience hands-on the VR devices
and VR videos made in tandem with theme park Everland at its exhibition venue.

The company is also displaying its top-notch home appliances including its super
ultra-high definition TVs and the Family Hub premium fridge that is equipped
with a 21.5-inch (54.6-cm)display on its right door.

LG is showcasing its premium home appliance lineup, dubbed the Signature,
consisting of organic light-emitting diode TVs, a washing machine that sports
dual tubs, and a connected fridge.

More than 400 companies, including mobile carriers SK Telecom and KT, automotive
firm KIA Motors and chipmaker Qualcomm, are participating in the trade show,
which will be held until Friday.
