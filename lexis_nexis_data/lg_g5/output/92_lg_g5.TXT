

LG Electronics Inc., South Korea's No. 2 smartphone maker, is unlikely to accept
preorders for its latest flagship, the G5 smartphone, and instead focus on
offline promotions of the device, industry sources said Thursday.

The South Korean tech giant had held preorders for its predecessors -- the G3
and the G4.

Industry watchers said LG made the move as preorders have been sluggish for
previous devices.

LG Electronics has not yet announced the official release date of the G5,
although it is rumored to be between end-March and early April.

The 5.3-inch G5 smartphone, slightly smaller than theG4, is claimed to be the
industry's first "Modular Type" smartphone, which connects with various
accessories, including a camera controller that allows users to control the
handset like a digital single-lens reflex camera.

Bigger local rival Samsung Electronics Co., however, started preorders for its
Galaxy S7 at home and abroad earlier this month, with official sales slated to
start Friday. Those applying for early purchases are given a Gear VR, Samsung's
virtual reality device.

LG Electronics has been suffering from ailing performances of its smartphones,
giving the G5 a crucial role in the fate of its business.

The firm's mobile business posted an operating loss of 43.8 billion won (36
million dollars) in the fourth quarter of last year, and has continued to post
weak returns amid heightened competition. The segment posted an operating loss
of 77.6 billion won in the third quarter of 2015. (Yonhap)
