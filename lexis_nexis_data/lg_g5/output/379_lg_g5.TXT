With LG announcing the LG 360 CAM at MWC last week, LG is expecting to see an
increase in creating and sharing 360 degree visual content using mobile devices.
Thanks to the launch of the LG 360 CAM and G5 smartphone, LG claims that
creating and sharing 360 degree content will be as easy as pressing a button.

While many phones now come with a simple point and shoot camera with a built in
panorama mode, 360 degree spherical images and videos take visuals even further
by including everything in the scene, including the ground and sky. The LG 360
CAM is a highly portable and compact imaging device capable of taking 360 degree
images at high resolution. It is also optimized for the Google Street View with
its support for the Google backed Open Spherical Camera API.

"This announcement of the LG 360 CAM means a lot to over 500 million Street View
users and all who loves to create and share 360-degree contents," said Charles
Armstrong, Product Manager of Google Street View. "With its capability to create
16MP images, the LG 360 CAM will be the most preferable choice for anyone to
join in the fun of 360-degree content."

Once users have the Google Street View app installed on their iOS or Android
phones, they can use the LG 360 CAM to easily capture, upload and share their
360 degree content directly from their phones, without having to convert them
into an appropriate format. The LG 360 CAM also comes with three embedded
microphones and supports 5.1 channel surround sound recording. It also comes
with an internal battery of 1200 mAh and a microSD card slot which can extend
the memory to a maximum of 2TB.

A release date for the LG 360 CAM is still to be revealed.
