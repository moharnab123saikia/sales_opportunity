under way. In honour of its 35th birthday, sponsor Louis Vuitton has created a

of chronograph Regatta timepieces - set to make waves.

Regatta OTUSA watch, £4,995 (www.bremont.com) GOOD CALL Thanks to its
interchangeable design, the LG G5 can become an eight megapixel digital camera,

LG G5 phone, £550 (www.lg.com) zip it Take note of the blouson jacket, making a
return this summer. The zip-front, shirt-collared jacket is a classic - and
