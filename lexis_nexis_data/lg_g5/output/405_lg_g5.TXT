unusual "modular" smartphone will feature a metal body that can be pulled apart
and upgraded with dedicated camera buttons, a new battery or an insert
delivering a Bang & Olufsen audio upgrade.LG Australia mobile communications
general manager Gino Casha said the build-it-yourself approach to the $1099 G5
was designed to "bring fun back to mobile phones" and give consumers a new
reason to upgrade handsets.
