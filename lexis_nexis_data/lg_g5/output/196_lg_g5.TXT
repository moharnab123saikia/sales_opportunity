

LG's Marshmallow-based UX 5.0 was officially released with the LG G5 flagship
smartphone in April this year.

The G5 placed a lot of emphasis on being a modular smartphone, and being part of
an ecosystem of linked devices.

Hence, UX 5.0 comes with the LG Friends Manager, which can be used to connect
the phone to other LG devices like the LG 360 Cam and the LG 360 VR.

The Friends Manager can automatically detect these other devices, connect to
them and find the appropriate software needed for the devices to work.

UX 5.0 also focuses heavily on the photo-taking experience, and LG has beefed up
the camera software with a host of features.

When using the front camera, Auto Shot detects whether a user is posing for a
picture, and automatically triggers the shutter, while Multi-View takes pictures
with the front, rear and wide-angle cameras all at once.

There is an Always Onscreen, which displays information without having to wake
up the phone.

UX 5.0 also comes with New Home, an integrated home screen where all the apps
are located, much like Apple's iOS.

And after the complaints during the beta about the lack of an apps drawer, the
final version of UX 5.0 has an option in the Settings menu to reinstate the app
drawer.
