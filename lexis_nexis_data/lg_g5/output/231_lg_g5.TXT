Remember when you could add things to phones other than Hello Kitty protective
cases? Back in the day, what made a phone cool was the way it slotted into
something (or something slotted into it). LG's new flagship 5.3-inch G5 phone
pays homage to this idea with its 'modular' design.

You can literally remove the bottom of the phone and add in different physical
bits of hardware. It could just be a replacement battery. But there are also
camera grips, VR sets and digital DAC music players that are compatible with it.
The phone has some other interesting specs, too. LG has put two cameras on the
back of the phone, a main 16-megapixel snapper and a second, wide-angle,
8-megapixel lens.

It adds a lot to the type of photo you can shoot on this handset.
