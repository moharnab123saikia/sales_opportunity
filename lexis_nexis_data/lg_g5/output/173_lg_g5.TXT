

LG Electronics said Thursday its flagship smartphone G5 shipments have exceeded
1.6 million units globally since its launch a month ago.

"We will see more than 3 million shipments in the second quarter," the company
said during a conference call when it reported a 65.5 percent surge in operating
profit to 505.2 billion won ($440 million) in the first quarter from a year ago.

Even though strong sales of home appliances, especially more lucrative premium
models, elevated the company's profits overall, the mobile business division
suffered a 200 billion won deficit due to marketing costs for the G5.

The company said it could see a turnaround in the second quarter when G5
shipments, along with those of the new budget phone K Series, start to be
reflected in sales.

The company predicted its quarterly sales could reach 3.6 trillion won in the
second quarter, calling the figure a break-even point for the mobile business
division.

The G5 is the industry's first modular smartphone that allows users to upgrade
camera and audio functions by switching different modules. Unlike earlier
concerns about the tricky production, the company said it has no supply
constraints.

Despite a profit surge in the first quarter, sales were down 4.5 percent to 13.9
trillion won compared to the same period last year largely due to seasonal week
demand for TVs and smartphones.

Sales of the vehicle component division reported a 55 percent growth on strong
performance of in-car infotainment systems but operating loss was 15.8 billion
won due to increased investments, the company said.
