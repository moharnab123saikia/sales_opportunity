for love of modular accessories!

In a very unlikely decision, the South Korean company LG seems to have bid a
farewell to the modular accessories for its upcoming flagship smartphone, the
G6, which is expected to be launched in 2017. The decision comes with a fact
that the recently launched smartphone, G5's modular accessories couldn't enter
the hearts of its customers.

The reason may be simple - people may not be interested in such gimmicks and are
looking for best features inside a smartphone itself, rather than adding on
expensive accessories to them.

We all know that G5 has not actually been as successful as the company had
guessed it would be. And, this may be a sole responsibility of the modular
system that was not pretty much of a click-n-go type! Users had to, in-fact,
remove the smartphone's battery when ever they had to connect an accessory. This
in-fact forced users to restart their phone every time they had to plus in a
mod!

Having said this, a source also cites that the company is internally worried
from withdrawing the strategy within just a year since its implementation. With
modular accessories going off-route soon, the company may even lose its
customers' trust, especially those who bought the G5 simply because of the
modular accessories.

However, the report also claims to soon expect the exact outline of G6
smartphone, which may give us a better understanding.
