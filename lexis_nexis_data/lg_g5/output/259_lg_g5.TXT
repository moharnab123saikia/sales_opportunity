tech giant is preparing to reduce about 1,000 employees at its struggling mobile
business division.

"We are relocating some employees to other business divisions as disclosed in
May, but we are not considering any job cuts," an LG Electronics spokesperson
told The Investor, a brand new online business news site recently launched by
The Korea Herald.

"Some hundreds of workers have been relocated on a regular basis," he added,
saying related works are still ongoing and no specifics have been decided yet.

On the day, News 1, a local news agency, reported that LG's mobile business
division will be downsizing to improve profitability. Except premium lines such
as V and G series, some hundreds of budget phone lineups are expected to be
drastically reduced, the report said.

In May, LG Electronics CEO and mobile chief Cho Juno unveiled the reshuffle plan
in his emailed message to employees on June 13. He also made it clear that there
would be no restructuring against individual employees' wills.

"We need to change the way we work to move faster and lighter," Cho said.

"Other business divisions also need people from MC (mobilecommunications). We
will continue to reshuffle personnel."

The division has struggled from operating losses since the failure of its
flagship smartphone G4 last year. The company relocated 15 to 20 percent of its
total workforce.

In its first-quarter earnings report in April, the company said it could see a
turnaround in the second quarter when G5 shipment start to be reflected in
sales. In the quarter, the company posted an operating loss of 202.2 billion won
(US$173 million).

The company forecast it would sell 3 million units of the G5 phone in the second
quarter, but industry watchers are skeptical about the sales target.
