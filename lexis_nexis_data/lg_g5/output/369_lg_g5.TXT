
DATELINE: New Delhi


New Delhi, Aug. 3 -- LG said its V20 device, successor to the V10 that went on
sale in October last year, will be the first product to run on Google's latest
version of its Android mobile operating system called Nougat at launch.

The company said last week the launch of new products, including a successor to
the V10, will help its performance improve in the third quarter. The firm has
two main premium phone series and its G5 phone, launched in March, has had
weaker-than-expected sales following initial production difficulties.

As a result, the South Korean firm's mobile business reported its fifth straight
quarter of operating loss for April-June. With Android 7.0 Nougat coming first
to LG V20, the South Korean company can pitch the device to more audience but it
is unclear whether the device will come with company's own UX on top of it. It
is also unlikely that V20 will launch in India considering the fact that LG
never made V10 available to Indian customers.
