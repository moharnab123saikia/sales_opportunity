It is pretty common to see that when one phone maker comes out with an
innovative feature that is quite the success, other phone makers will follow,
and this time it's the 3D Touch feature seen from the latest iPhones.

According to a report on GizmoChina, many China based Android phone makers are
reportedly working on their own iteration of the of the famed 3D Touch feature.
Phone makers such as Xiaomi, Meizum, Oppo and Vivo all have their own versions
of the technology in the pipelines for their upcoming devices. It is rumored
that the next Google Nexus phone, which will be made by HTC will also have a
similar pressure sensitive display.

The pressure sensitive display was one of the key features seen on the latest
iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which allows users to press harder on the screen to
access extra functions. The technology has already been mimicked on the Huawei
Mate S.

Variable force sensing technology is already available to phone manufacturers at
the moment, however it is a question of how quickly they can implement this into
their devices, while still staying within a reasonable price bracket. The 3D
Touch style technology hasn't made its way to the new Samsung Galaxy S7 or LG
G5, however, once the Chinese manufacturers get it done it would not be
surprising if other major companies follow suit.
