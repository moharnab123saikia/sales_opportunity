do not comply with USB Type-C regulations

Despite the fact that both LG G5 and HTC 10 are very impressive Android phones
in their own separate leagues, one engineer is not too optimistic of using both
phones thanks to the USB Type-C specification. This is because not only do both
devices support Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 (thanks to featuring a Snapdragon
820 SoC), but also because both smartphones feature the unique charging port,
which obviously presents a great deal of a problem.

According to the Googler, neither HTC 10 nor the LG G5 can be considered USB
Type-C spec compliant due to the inclusion of Quick Charge 3.0. Now why is this
so important? According to the person on his Google Plus account: He states
that:

"This is not a legacy cable. This time, I'm reviewing Black Squid's
Full-Featured C-to-C cable! tl;dr: Good cable! Charges at up to 60W, connect
your laptop to your USB 3.1 devices, drive a 4K display...All using 1 cable!
This is the first C-to-C cable I have reviewed, and it's one that does A LOT of
different functions. Excuse the length of this review. I tested with 3 different
chargers, one of them actually an external display dock with a 4K screen. The
cable allowed the Pixel 2 to charge itself, while displaying 4K 60hz video out
and accessing the USB hub on the monitor over a single cable. Woot! For more
information about the difference between USB 2.0 C-to-C and Full Featured C-to-C
