Mobile World Congress (MWC).

The technology show, taking place in Barcelona, saw Samsung unveil the Galaxy S7
and S7 edge smartphones, while LG revealed the G5 phone, which has a modular
design where new parts, such as a speaker or a camera can be attached to the
device.

Both Samsung and LG confirmed they would be releasing 360 cameras in the coming
months.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg also made a surprise appearance at Samsung's
press conference to discuss 360 video, which the social network supports. The
billionaire added he hoped to film his daughter's first steps using the
technology. Chinese firm Huawei also introduced a new hybrid laptop, the
MateBook, while LG introduced a mini robot for home security called the Rolling
Bot, which can also monitor and even play with pets.

MWC has become a key smartphone event, with hundreds of accessories shown off
for the first time alongside the new devices, as well as future technologies
also being broadly discussed.

This year is also expected to see discussion on 5G internet - the next
generation of wireless data for phones .
