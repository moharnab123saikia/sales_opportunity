

South Korean device maker LG has introduced its much-anticipated new premium
smartphone - the Android-powered LG G5 - which marks a notable innovation on the
part of the company, in terms of changed design and components. The handset is
scheduled to hit the US markets in April.

The new LG G5 is an all-metal smartphone which marks an evident attempt by LG to
differentiate its device from among the hordes of other Android-based
smartphones. One of the unique selling points of the G5 is its capability to
work as a 'modular' handset, enabling users to swap the bottom of the handset --
the, so to say, removable 'chin' -- with modules offering enhanced features,
like improved audio quality and better camera capabilities.

The 159-gram LG G5 handset measures 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7 mm, and - even despite
the modular feature - boasts the inclusion of top-of-the-line specifications.

Some of the key features of the G5 handset include a 5.3-inch 'Always On' QHD
display with 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution; Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 820
octa-core processor; the newest Adreno 530 GPU; 4GB of faster DDR4 RAM; 2,800
mAh battery; and 32GB of onboard storage capacity, with the option of expanding
storage to p to 200GB via a microUSB card.

The LG G5 handset will come with two rear cameras -- a 16-megapixel camera and
an 8-megapixel camera -- with new software, as well as an 8-megapixel
front-facing camera for selfies and video chats.
