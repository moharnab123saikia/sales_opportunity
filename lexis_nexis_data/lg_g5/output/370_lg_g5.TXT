Seoul, Aug. 1 -- South Korea's LG Electronics Inc said on Monday it plans to
start selling a new premium smartphone from September, hoping the device will
help its struggling mobile business recover from disappointing sales.


 LG said its V20 device, successor to the V10 that went on sale in October last
year, will be the first product to run on Google's latest version of its Android
mobile operating system called Nougat at launch. The company did not disclose
further details on the V20.
 The firm has two main premium phone series and its G5 phone, launched in March,
has had weaker-than-expected sales following initial production difficulties. As
a result, the South Korean firm's mobile business reported its fifth straight
quarter of operating loss for April-June.
 The company said last week the launch of new products, including a successor to
the V10, will help its performance improve in the third quarter. Rivals are also
pushing new devices to market soon, however
