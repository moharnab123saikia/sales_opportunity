will be pre-installed on the latest smartphone from LG Electronics, the LG G5,
to enable users to connect with more confidence. This extends an existing
agreement whereby LG Electronics selected McAfee Mobile Security to help protect
against security threats and provide theft protection for its G4 smartphone.
With the pre-installed application, LG G5 users will enjoy antivirus and
anti-theft benefits as well as enhanced privacy settings, enabling them to
experience the mobile world with greater confidence.

As we become increasingly connected, mobile devices are the tip of the spear for
new hacking methods. Intel Security's Mobile Threat Report recently found that
three million mobile devices were affected by malware solely through mobile app
stores over the past six months. Additionally, Intel Security found that in Q4
2015 mobile malware samples increased 24 percent compared to Q3 2015,
reinforcing the need for consumers to have appropriate protection to help
protect their devices and digital lives.

"McAfee Mobile Security offers award-winning protection for mobile devices, so
it's no surprise that smartphone manufacturer LG chose it to help protect its G4
and now G5 smartphones," said John Giamatteo, corporate vice president at Intel
Security. "As LG's customers turn to mobile devices and mobile applications to
enrich their lives, we will offer them innovative solutions to help protect
their devices, their digital lives and allow them to connect to the Internet
more securely and with confidence."
