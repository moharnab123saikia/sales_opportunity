Samsung has revealed its first 360-degree camera and a partnership with Facebook

for creating virtual reality content. Meanwhile, the LG G5's modular design lets

users attach its own compact VR headset.



South Korean tech giants Samsung and LG unveiled new smartphones with better

cameras and turned to virtual reality to boost interest in their headsets at a

time of slowing sales.



Samsung launched two versions of its flagship phone - the flat-screen Galaxy S7

and the curved screen Galaxy S7 edge - with cameras that can take better

pictures under low-light conditions.



The company, the world's number one smartphone maker, also debuted its first

360-degree camera - the Gear 360 - in Barcelona, where the mobile industry has

gathered for the start of the Mobile World Congress, in its latest attempt to

remain ahead of Apple.



The camera is designed to make it easy to take all-around photos and videos that

can be uploaded to Facebook and YouTube, or viewed as immersive experiences on

Samsung's virtual reality Gear VR headsets, which went on sale in November.



"User-generated 360-degree photos and films are going to see rapid growth in

2016. Numerous 360-degree cameras are being launched and users will want to get

access to this content," said Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight.



"Although it can be viewed on a standard smartphone or PC screen, the most

impactful way of looking at this content is with a VR headset - this is

undoubtedly going to drive sales of these products."



Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a surprise appearance at the

Samsung press conference to announce a partnership with the South Korean firm to

promote the use of virtual reality on the social network.



"We want to make Facebook the best video platform for virtual reality and

Samsung is the only company in the world that can provide a good experience in

terms of virtual reality," he said.



Rival South Korean tech firm LG sought to steal Samsung's thunder by unveiling

its new premium handset - the G5, its first modular smartphone, which is made

using different components that can be independently upgraded or replaced, such

as a removable battery.



The G5 comes with several accessories, such as a sound system developed by

Danish firm Bang & Olufsen, and a virtual reality headset which will allow it to

compete with the Gear VR headset launched by Samsung last year.



The focus on accessories comes with the smartphone market beginning to slow as

it becomes increasingly saturated.



LG's profits halved last year on the back of a global economic slowdown and

increased competition in the mobile sector, while Samsung was only able to boost

its market share moderately.



Apple, which will not be present at the congress in Barcelona, saw iPhone sales

fall for the first time on an annual basis in the final quarter of last year,

according to Gartner.



The market research firm said that the 9.7 percent increase in smartphone sales

in the final quarter of last year over the same period in 2014 takes the

industry all the way back to 2008, when the global economy was in crisis.



"All of these additional devices, whether it is a virtual reality goggle,

whether it is a camera, whether it is a smartwatch, they are all ways of

generating additional profits," said Ian Fogg, the head mobile and technology

analyst at IHS Technology.



Analysts said handset makers face a tough choice. Focus on the low-price

segment, where sales volumes are large but margins become thin, or focus on

features which can differentiate their phones.



"We are moving towards a logic of segmentation and improvement, with a better

camera or more autonomy for example, maybe some advances in virtual reality, but

there will unlikely be any major innovation," said Thomas Husson, an analyst at

Forrester.
