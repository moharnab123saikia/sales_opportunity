LG is all set to release its latest flagship V20 this week, and it looks like it
might not be a modular device.

Unlike the G5, the V20 wont be having a modular concept. According to eyewitness
accounts the LG V20 won't come with swappable "friends" modules, but it will
have a removable battery. This can be done by taking off the back cover, which
gives you access to the battery as well as the slots for SIM card and microSD.

According to sources who have seen the phone, LG would not include a modular
approach mainly to shorten the time between manufacture and getting the handset
on shelves. The earlier V10 didnt have a modular approach as well, so its not
really that big of a surprise when its not in the V20.

On the other hand, modular devices are not doing that well. The LG G5 didnt sell
as well as the company hoped, and Google also shut down its Project Ara phone
last week. LG is launching the V20 at a San Francisco event tomorrow, September
6, and we are waiting for more details regarding prices and availability.
