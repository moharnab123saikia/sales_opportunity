LG has a habit of taking the stage at the annual CES show in Las Vegas over the

past two years, revealing the G Flex and G Flex 2 earlier. This year however, we

might not be hearing anything about the LG G Flex 3.



With CES 2016 only a few weeks away, there hasn't been any official story on the

LG G Flex 3, and we might not even hear anything about it during the event.

According to Media Daum, a Korean news website, LG might reportedly get rid of

the phone all together. Although this is still a rumor at this point, there is

still no news on why LG would cancel the G Flex series, even when its other

flagships are not exactly selling well. One possibility is that LG would want to

focus more on a device that can compete long term with the Samsung Galaxy S6 or

iPhone 6s, rather than devices that have a short lived novelty to them.



However, the report also mentions that LG will be unveiling the LG G5 in April

next year, as well as a successor to the LG V10 in the second half of 2016. If

the report is true, the LG G5 might be sporting a Snapdragon 820 CPU, Adreno 530

GPU with a 5.6 inch 2K display with a 21MP camera. It might also come with an

iris scanner or at least a finger scanner.



Last year LG had an amazing stall at CES having the only new handset by a major

company and grabbed majority of the spotlight, let's hope LG can pull off

something similar this year as well.
