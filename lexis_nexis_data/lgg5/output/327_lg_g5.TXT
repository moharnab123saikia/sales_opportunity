Rumor: LG V20 Releasing Early September



LENGTH: 150  words





New rumors suggest LG will be releasing its next flagship smartphone early

September.



According to Korean website ETNews, LG is busy prepping the successor to last

year's critically hit V10 smartphone.



Sources close to the website claims that LG's next will be called V20, as

opposed to V11, and will release early September. The phone was initially

scheduled for a late September to October release, but LG wants to make it

during the Fall season for better sales opportunity. This means that LG will be

going up against Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and the iPhone 7, both of which are

expected to release this Fall as well.



One of the reasons LG wants to do an early release is because it wants users to

forget about the G5, which was failure in terms of sales, and shift focus on a

brand new smartphone. We don't know what kind of hardware the V20 will pack, but

expect to hear more about it pretty soon.
