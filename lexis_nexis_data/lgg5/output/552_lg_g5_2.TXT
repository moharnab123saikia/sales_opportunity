New Delhi, April 13 -- Zee Media Bureau

 Taiwanese handset maker HTC Technologies on Tuesday unveiled the much awaited

smartphone, the HTC 10 with a hope to take on Samsung Galaxy S7, LG G5 and

iPhone 6S.





 The company introduced the smartphone as HTC 10, the Power of 10.

 The company reportedly said it took them 12 months to design the HTC 10

integrating feedback from its customers through the development process.

 On the specification front, the HTC 10 comes with a 5.2-inch quad HD Super LCD

5 display which gives a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels.

 The company claims the screen displays 30 percent more color than last year's

phone.

 The HTC 10 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor along with 4GB of

RAM. Then, there is 32GB internal storage that can be expanded via a MicroSD

slot.

 It also comes with a 3,000mAh which HTC says is good for up to two days of life

thanks to software and hardware optimizations.

 It supports Quick Charge 3.0 through the phone's USB Type-C port.
