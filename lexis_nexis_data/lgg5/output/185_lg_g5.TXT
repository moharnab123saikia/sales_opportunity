always-on clock screen. During that day you can expect the phone to perform well
and at speed, as well as do all the things that are the bare minimum for a phone
- you know, making phone calls with good audio quality and decent signal
reception.

Always-on screen:Like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, the G5 has an always-on
display that shows the time on an otherwise black screen. This saves you from
waking the phone whenever you just want to know the time. As with Samsung, it's
very low in its power draw - less than 1% of the battery per hour.

Power button and fingerprint sensor:LG has previously limited its buttons to one
- a power switch and volume rocker in the middle of the phone's back. That's
almost the case here - though the volume control is now on the left edge.

The power button is also the fingerprint sensor. To turn on the phone you just
rest the finger on it, rather than pressing. - INM
