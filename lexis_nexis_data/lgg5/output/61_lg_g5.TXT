During the company's official smartphone unveiling, LG G5 was brought into the

spotlight and it is completely different as far as its predecessors are

concerned. First off, the smartphone features the best hardware that you can

expect in a smartphone. Starting off, the handset sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon

820 chipset, and yes, the smartphone will be providing support for Quick Charge

3.0.



Aside from 4GB of RAM, LG G5 also has 32GB of internal storage, along with a

microSD card slot that can accommodate up to 2TB of storage cards. This will

effectively transform your flagship smartphone into a portable media hub, if you

are willing to invest a whole lot of cash in a 2TB microSD card (which have not

been released, mind you). The phone itself has a 5.3 inch IPS LCD and we were

happy to see that G5 did not go overboard with the resolution and decided to

keep it maintained at 1440p for the sake of battery life. Speaking of battery

life, consumers will be able to rake out at least a whole day of average use

with a 2,800mAh removable cell present inside it.



The device itself comprises of a complete metal unibody, so in short, we are

glad to see that Android phone manufacturers are getting real serious in

incorporating both design, aesthetics and flexibility in their high-end

offerings. Most of the critics out there will argue that 2,800mAh is far too low

to be present in an expensive device like this, but only the tests will conclude

that. Additionally, the presence of LG's custom UI and the fact that G5 is

running Android Marshmallow 6.0 means that there are going to be several

performance and battery level optimizations that were serve your purpose till

the end.



LG G5 is also the first smartphone from the company to sport a USB-C port.

Unlike microUSB ports, USB-C ports can deliver more power and transfer data much

quicker as opposed to the previous interface that you readily see in Android and

Windows Phone powered handsets. The 16MP rear camera sensor has an aperture of

f/1.8, which is the same as those present in the smartphone's predecessors.

While we were expecting some upgrades from this side of the smartphone, LG G5

does have a rear sensor with a 135 degrees wide angle lens, allowing you to

capture more content as a result.



There are no pricing details provided, but we will keep you up to date on how

much LG G5 will cost when available for consumers.
