LG Electronics denies downsizing report

[THE INVESTOR] LG Electronics dismissed Thursday a news report the Korean tech

giant is preparing to reduce about 1,000 employees at its struggling mobile

business division.



"We are relocating some employees to other business divisions as disclosed in

May, but we are not considering cutting any jobs," an LG Electronics

spokesperson told The Investor, a new online business news site recently

launched by The Korea Herald.



"Some hundreds of workers have been relocated on a regular basis," he added,

saying related works are still ongoing and no specifics have been decided yet.



On Thursday, News 1, a local news agency, reported that LG's mobile business

division would be downsizing to improve profitability. Apart from premium lines

such as the V and G series, some hundreds of budget phone lineups are expected

to be drastically reduced, the report said.



In May, LG Electronics CEO and mobile chief Cho Juno unveiled the reshuffle plan

in an emailed message to employees. He also made it clear that there would be no

restructuring against individual employees' wills.



"We need to change the way we work to move faster and lighter," the company's

CEO and mobile chief Cho Juno said in an email message to employees Monday.



"Other business divisions also need people from MC (mobile communications). We

will continue to reshuffle personnel."



The division has struggled from operating losses since the failure of its

flagship smartphone G4 last year. The company relocated 15 to 20 percent of its

total workforce.



In its first-quarter earnings report in April, the company said it could see a

turnaround in the second quarter when G5 shipment starts to be reflected in

sales. In the quarter, the company posted an operating loss of 202.2 billion won

($173 million).



The company has forecast it will sell 3 million units of the G5 phone in the

second quarter, but industry watchers are skeptical about the sales target.
