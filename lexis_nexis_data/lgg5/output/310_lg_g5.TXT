Meanwhile, Sony surprised everyone by announcing a bunch of new phones, the

Xperia X, Xperia X Performance, Xperia X Premium and Xperia XA. The Xperia XA

runs a MediaTek processor and might come to India as a budget offering, while

the Xperia X Premium runs a Snapdragon 820.



The showstoppers clearly are the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 launched on Sunday.

Most crowds are lining up to see these two new phones. The LG G5 is clearly more

innovative of the two, ushering in the option of adding modular appendages to

improve audio quality, camera results and battery life.



Lenovo, meanwhile, showcased the Vibe K5 and Vibe K5 Plus which can be expected

to hit the Indian market soon. The company is already the third largest

smartphone manufacturer in India along with Motorola and is expected to

strengthen its offering in the sub-$150-range with these new phones.



One little-known device that could have a lot of promise is the Ozo 360-degree

camera from Nokia which will be the first professional grade VR camera.



Price upwards of $60,000, the cameras could find widespread use in the movie

industry, according to the Finnish technology company, which is exploring new

avenues since selling its smartphone business to Microsoft. Given that Samsung

beamed its Galaxy S7 launch event on Sunday in VR, we can now assume that VR has

finally gone mainstream.
