Xperia X, Xperia X Performance, Xperia X Premium and Xperia XA. The Xperia XA
runs a MediaTek processor and might come to India as a budget offering, while
the Xperia X Premium runs a Snapdragon 820.

The showstoppers clearly are the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 launched on Sunday.
Most crowds are lining up to see these two new phones. The LG G5 is clearly more
innovative of the two, ushering in the option of adding modular appendages to
improve audio quality, camera results and battery life.

Lenovo, meanwhile, showcased the Vibe K5 and Vibe K5 Plus which can be expected
to hit the Indian market soon. The company is already the third largest
smartphone manufacturer in India along with Motorola and is expected to
strengthen its offering in the sub-$150-range with these new phones.

One little-known device that could have a lot of promise is the Ozo 360-degree
camera from Nokia which will be the first professional grade VR camera.

Price upwards of $60,000, the cameras could find widespread use in the movie
industry, according to the Finnish technology company, which is exploring new
avenues since selling its smartphone business to Microsoft. Given that Samsung
beamed its Galaxy S7 launch event on Sunday in VR, we can now assume that VR has
finally gone mainstream.
