as more consumers want to enjoy the visual capability of the devices.

With smartphones getting slimmer, there is a technical limit for a one-lens
camera to increase a handset's photographic capability. So, manufacturers are
installing dual-lens cameras for a better visual experience, analysts say.

LG Electronics unveiled the G5 smartphone featuring dual-lens cameras in
February this year.

dual-lens camera. The P9 smartphone is co-engineered with Germany's iconic
optical brand Leica.
