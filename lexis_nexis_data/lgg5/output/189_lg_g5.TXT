[THE INVESTOR] Dual-lens cameras on the back of smartphone are getting popular

as more consumers want to enjoy the visual capability of the devices.



With smartphones getting slimmer, there is a technical limit for a one-lens

camera to increase a handset's photographic capability. So, manufacturers are

installing dual-lens cameras for a better visual experience, analysts say.



LG Electronics unveiled the G5 smartphone featuring dual-lens cameras in

February this year.

"The G5's 135-degree wide angle lens lets you choose between standard or wide

angle to get more in the shot," LG said in a press release.



In April, China's Huawei Technologies introduced its P9 smartphone with a

dual-lens camera. The P9 smartphone is co-engineered with Germany's iconic

optical brand Leica.



Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus early next month. The

iPhone 7 Plus has been speculated to feature a dual-lens camera, according to

foreign media reports.



Samsung Electronics has yet to embrace a dual-lens camera, but some foreign

media outlets have speculated that Samsung's next Galaxy S8 smartphone may

feature one.
