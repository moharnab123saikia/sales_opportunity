

Korean news website ETNews has revealed in a recent report that LG will ditch
the modular-like design for its next flagship smartphone -- LG G6 -- which will
likely be launched in spring 2017.



The move by LG to fall back on a more traditional design for its G5 handsets is
seemingly rooted in the fact that the company recorded less-than-stellar sales
of its April-launched G5 handset which featured the company's unique
modular-like design.

The LG G5 handset comes with a removable battery which can be swapped out from
the device's bottom chin. Moreover, the functionality of the handset can be
enhanced with the help of some other add-on accessories, including a camera grip
and a digital-to-analog audio converter.

But, due to the lacklustre sales of the G5 handset, LG has now decided to
abandon the modular approach for the forthcoming G6 handset. LG's decision to
revert back to a traditional design for G6 underscores an evident attempt by the
company to bring the smartphone back into the mainstream market, hoping for an
increase in sales.

However, LG's decision to ditch the modular concept in its new G6 handset would
be a blow to developers and consumers who had invested in the company's modular
ecosystem on the assumption that the concept would be developed further.
