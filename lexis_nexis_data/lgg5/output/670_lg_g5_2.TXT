Last week we saw the first press renders of the HTC One M10, which looked

surprisingly a lot like the One M9. This week, a whole new collection of renders

has popped up, showcasing the different colors it could possibly come in.



Although, the authenticity of these images are still quite doubtful, it does

seem like these color options will be included in the range. The renders showed

up courtesy of Weibo-user, @upleaks, and includes gold, dark gray and aluminum

metallic finishes. If the leak is to be trusted, it could indicate that HTC is

also planning to launch a version with both black and white front panels for the

first time, with the combination of anodized aluminum bodies.



There are chances that the renders are sketchy, which is mainly due to the tiny

clues seen on the renders. Couple of the images show a Google search widget with

the old Google logo, which has not been used for a while. Secondly, the front

camera module also seems a bit off place from previous leaks as well. The date

shown on one of the renders also does not match the earlier mentioned April

19th, although it is possible that HTC might have worked on multiple images

without paying attention to detail.



In terms of Specs, the HTC One M10 is expected to come with a 5.15-inch QHD

AMOLED display, Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and a 12MP high-end Sony

camera sensor on the back. It's also claimed the HTC 10 will run Android 6.0.1

Marshmallow out of the box. HTC is hoping that with the M10, it could put some

reasonable distance between it and the LG G5 and Samsung S7.
