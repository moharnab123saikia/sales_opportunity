

New Delhi, Aug 26 (IBNS): LG Electronics India Limited (LGEIL) on Friday
announced the launch of its latest smartphone, LG X Cam in India.

The X Cam is designed to deliver exceptional value to those who want a
smartphone with a unique feature such as a Dual camera, that too at an
affordable price. Like the LG G5, the X cam inherits a similar 120-degree wide
angle lens to complement the standard lens. The 13MP standard angle lens and the
5MP wide angle camera on the rear of the X cam delivers as wide a field of view
as the human eye, basically it captures 53% more area than the traditional
cameras on the smartphones.

The X cam offers Pop-out Picture feature which combines the two images taken
with the standard and wide angle lenses to create a picture-in-a-frame effect.
Available only on the X cam Panorama View automatically scrolls a wide image
instead of a static image and the Signature feature allows users to add a
caption or byline after taking a photo. Amit Gujral, Marketing Head Mobiles, LG
India said, With X Cam, we are giving consumers a Dual camera smartphone at a
reasonable price point. We are sure that the Indian consumers will like the very
rare in smartphones, wide angle feature, something that has been inherited from
our premium smartphone LG G5. This wide angle photography would be a unique
experience in this segment and consumers shall surely embrace this new
experience, which otherwise is possible only with nature gifted eyes LG X Screen
will be priced in India at Rs. 19,990 and will be available from today across
stores in India. Image: LG twitter page
