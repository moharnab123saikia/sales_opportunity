1. AppView: Mekorama



The game is innovative and simple, and the design- all the work by Magni

himself- is creative. There are 50 levels to begin with, and Magni posts new

levels on Facebook and Twitter, which players can download. Users can also build

their own levels, block by block- a clever idea that keeps avid gamers

interested and invested. There are hints at every level, which are only

available to those who pay, but the payment system is largely a

pay-what-you-like one. Read The Full Story Here.



2. 9 Ways How iPhone Changed The Smartphone Industry



Even now, the words of Steve Jobs 'an iPod... a phone... an internet

communications device...' still reverberate in our minds; the vision and the

dream of the man of creating a device that fuelled the aspirations of both geeks

and lay users alike. Oh boy! What's even more captivating is that the legacy

continues even nine years after Steve Jobs launched that first device. In terms

of style, substance and technology, the iPhone has been ahead of the technology

curve. The man who visioned this is no more, but his legacy continues. Read The

Full Story Here.



3. Warning! Godless Is Out There Rooting Your Device



Type in 'Godless' in Google Search and what you get is nothing but the Android

virus that's making a hell lot of noise lately. Reports have been stating that

the new virus is capable of rooting almost 90 per cent of Android devices, and

almost 50 per cent of the affected devices are in India. Before we actually dive

into more info, let's understand what is 'Godless'. It is a malware with

capabilities of rooting your device without your knowledge. Read The Full Story

4. 9 Hot Android Smartphones Expected To Hit The Shelves Soon



There's always another smartphone on the horizon. After the launch of major

high-end models such as HTC 10, Samsung Galaxy S7, LG G5, OnePlus 3, Xiaomi Mi 5

and others in India, companies now seem likely to focus on the mid-range

smartphone market in the next few weeks. Read The Full Story Here.



5. Origami Behind Modern Technology Innovations



Ever since something like 3D printing came into existence, creating and molding

surfaces became a computer controlled automated activity and bought about many

solutions to problems. But before all of this technology took over, the ancient

Japanese art of Origami was behind creating wonderful aesthetic shapes and forms

from flat surfaces.These days however, it is also behind creating some of modern

engineering's most innovative products such as origami pills as a replacement

for invasive surgery, or folding solar panels on airplanes which can be furled

and unfurled as per need. The theme of it all lies in the idea of transforming a

flat surface into something totally different. Read The Full Story Here.



6. Micro-LED Display On The Cards Next For Apple Watch?



Ah, rumours. Heady things, as those clever inventors of tabloid journalism knew.

The latest from the rumour mill is that Apple (headquartered at Cupertino... we

all know Apple) is working on replacing the LCD display in the Apple Watch with

a new Micro-LED display for the next evolution of the product. Read The Full

Story Here.



7. Lenovo ZUK Z1: Strictly for the Savvy



The Zuk Z1 doesn't have a very inspired design. It's as plain Jane as can be and

I'd be fairly disappointed carrying it around because it's big at 5.5 inches and

not terribly narrow either, so one notices it. It has a metal frame and a

plastic back though it's a unibody phone. It doesn't look bad, mind you... Just

not built to turn heads. On the other hand, it feels solid and well-built and

there are many who love its understated design. Read The Full Story Here.



8. Five Best Portable Speakers Under INR 2,000



If you have a taste for music, its a need to have to plug-in your music just

about anywhere, and get listening. But then with the modern lifestyle, one also

needs portability and wireless operations to make devices less cumbersome, and

economic on the pocket. Read The Full Story Here.



9. Yu Yunicorn: No Mythical Creature



The unicorn may be elusive and legendary, but the Yunicorn is very much here and

now, a biggish phone from Micromax's Yu Televentures. The Yunicorn looks very

much like the Meizu M3 Note, reviewed here recently, but scores over it despite

the fact the M3 Note is Rs.9,999. The brushed metal back looks a bit classier

and so do the glinting edges. It's just the front that looks like the Meizu M3

Note -- and every other phone around. Read The Full Story Here.



10. LG G5: First To Go Modular



For a couple of years there's been talk of whether phones should be modular. You

have the same basic size and shape but you can always carry bits to add to the

functions and features. At the Mobile World Congress this year, LG excited me no

end by being the first to come up with this concept in real life and bring it to

market. It even got awarded the best phone at the show. It all sounded good --

on paper. Read The Full Story Here.
