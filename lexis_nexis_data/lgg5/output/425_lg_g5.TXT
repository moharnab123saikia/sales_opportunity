NEW DELHI: It's official, South Korean giant LG will be launching its V20

smartphone on September 6 in San Francisco. LG V20 is the company's first

smartphone to run Android 7.0 Nougat OS version.



The San Francisco launch will be followed by an event in the company's home

country South Korea's capital Seoul on September 7.



The company has sent invites for both the events. It has also posted a playful

teaser with words "Play More" written on it. The teaser has a toy book which

opens into a three-dimensional street.



Coming to LG V20, the specifications of the handset are still unknown. However,

since LG is one of the Google partners for the Daydream platform, we might see

something on that front as well. The company too said that the V20 will be

delivering a better multimedia experience.



According to speculations floating on the web, LG V20 will feature a 5.5-inch

Full HD resolution display of 1080x1920 pixel. This is quite surprising as the

current LG V10 has a larger 5.7-inch display with better 1440x2560 pixel

resolution.



The V20 is likely to be powered by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor

clubbed with Adreno 530 GPU and 3GB/4GB RAM. It is supposed to come with 32GB

/64GB of in-built storage, along with support for microSD cards of up to 256GB

in size.



So far, there is also no information about V20 sporting a secondary screen

(similar to the one in V10). There is also no mention of the device coming with

a dual-camera setup. The handset will likely include a 20MP rear camera and an

8MP front-facing shooter. A USB Type-C port and a 4,000mAh battery are also

expected.



LG recently announced its financial results for Q2 2016. The company shipped a

total of 13.9 million smartphones in the second quarter, an increase of 3% from

the previous quarter. The mobile division also registered revenues of $2.86

billion, a 12% increase over the first quarter, while declining over the same

period the year before. LG reported an operating loss of $132.10 million,

blaming "reflected increased marketing expenditures and somewhat slow initial

sales of G5 smartphone."
