LG G5 Redefines Holiday Photography with Wide Angle Shooting



LENGTH: 241  words





With millions of GCC residents vacationing in various places around the globe

this summer, shooting holiday photographs with family and friends is top of

mind, especially for the traveler yearning to capture the most of each unique

experience.



Among the myriad smartphones on offer, one model packages best-ofbreed camera

functions into an ultra-slim smartphone:



The LG G5. With popular market demand for optimized camera functionality, the LG

G5's related software suite is designed to be intuitive and easy to use when it

comes to setting up, taking and editing shots. It offers bestof-its-kind

features in its wideangle camera. Key highlights include:



Wide Angle Shooting Outdoors Chances are, during vacation, travelling through

some impressive scenery is highly likely- be it landscapes, seascapes or

cityscapes.But few cameras (and even fewer smartphone cameras) are equipped to

shoot such dramatic scenes for a simple reason: A regular camera lens offers a

field of vision of just 78 degrees, compared to human eyesight, which offers a

120-degree panorama.



The LG G5, however, is equipped with dual cameras, including a Wide Angle Lens

that spans 135 degrees. This allows users to capture breadth in any shot - be it

waves crashing on a beach, mountains cascading into the distance or crowds

seething across a city plaza. Amplifying ease of use, the G5's camera, when

zooming wider than 78 degrees, automatically engages the wide angle functions.
