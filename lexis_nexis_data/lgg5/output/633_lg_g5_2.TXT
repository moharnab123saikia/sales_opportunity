Google, Apple resist moves to uninstall preloaded apps



LENGTH: 186 words





[THE INVESTOR] Google and Apple are resisting the Korean government's legal

revision to uninstall preloaded apps on their new mobile devices.



According to local news daily Asia Economy, the two US tech giants have recently

offered their official opposition to the planned revision through the American

Chamber of Commerce in Korea.



Preinstalled apps on Apple's iPhone



In April, the Korea Communications Commission, the telecom regulator, announced

a revision that will allow consumers to delete apps they don't need.



Following government guidelines announced in 2014, Korean handset manufacturers

and telecom carriers are making their preinstalled apps removable but foreign

companies such as Google and Apple still resist following the rules that are not

legally binding.



Local companies preinstall some 60 apps on new devices but most of them, except

three to four key apps, now can be removed.



Google, the operator of the most widely used operating system Android here,

installs 11 preloaded apps in Samsung's Galaxy S7 and 14 in LG's G5. All the

apps, categorized as essential, cannot be removed.
