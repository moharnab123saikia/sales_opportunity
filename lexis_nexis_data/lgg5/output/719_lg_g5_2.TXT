LENGTH: 535 words





Samsung Electronics Co., South Korea's top tech firm, is forecast to report

market forecast-beating earnings for the second quarter of the year, as

shipments of its flagship smartphones such as the Galaxy S7 series was better

than expected, industry sources said Monday.



Market consensus for the second-quarter operating income of Samsung, the world's

top smartphone maker set to unveil its second-quarter earnings guidance this

week, is at 7.32 trillion won (US$6.38 billion) for the April-June period, up

26.2 percent from the estimate three months earlier, according to data compiled

by industry tracker FnGuide.



Some local securities companies have been raising their earnings outlook for the

tech behemoth. In a note to clients, Hi Investment & Securities Co. predicted

Samsung's second-quarter operating income would soar by 21 percent from a year

earlier to 8.1 trillion won.



"Samsung Electronics' operating profit is expected to exceed the earlier

estimate," said Song Myung-seob, an analyst at Hi Investment & Securities,

further forecasting an increased dividend payout.



In the January-March period, Samsung' operating profit moved up 11.65 percent

from a year earlier to 6.67 trillion won and its net profit advanced 13.55

percent on-year to 5.25 trillion won.



In the first quarter of 2015, Samsung's operating profit came to 5.98 trillion

won, and its net profit also plunged 39 percent due to weak earnings from its

mobile business.



For all of 2015, Samsung's net profit shed 18.53 percent to 19 trillion won. Its

operating profit came to 26.4 trillion won, also up 5.55 percent from the

previous year, but sales dropped 2.69 percent to 200.6 trillion won.



Industry watchers estimate the tech behemoth to rake in some 4 trillion won in

operating profit solely from its mobile business division in the second quarter

of this year on the back the success of the Galaxy S7 series.



The division posted an operating profit of 3.89 trillion won during the

January-March period of 2016, up 42 percent from a year earlier.



Samsung's latest flagships -- -- the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge -- were

released in March of the year.



The sources estimate that Samsung's combined shipments of the Galaxy S7 and S7

Edge hovered at some 15 million units in the April-June period. Noticeably, the

sales of the Galaxy S7 Edge, which is more expensive, might have beaten out the

Galaxy S7, according to the sources.



Samsung Electronics sold 81.18 million smartphone units around the globe in the

January-March period, bolstered by the early release of its flagship Galaxy S7

series.



On Friday, Samsung stocks gained 2.88 percent to 1,466,000 won on hopes for

better-than-expected earnings outlook.



Other major tech firms listed on the South Korean stock market are also

predicted to see their earnings improve in the second quarter of the year from a

year ago.



The country's No. 2 tech giant LG Electronics Inc. is forecast to have logged

595 billion won in operating profits for the April-June period, up from 505

billion won in the January-March period,



Industry watchers forecast the firm to witness the sluggish sales of its

flagship G5 smartphone, but to boast the strong profitability of home appliances

and TV segments. (Yonhap)
