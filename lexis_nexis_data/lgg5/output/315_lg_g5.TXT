unaffected

 New York: Moody's Investors Service has issued the following news release:







   Moody's Investors Service says LG Electronics Inc.'s (LGE, Baa3 negative) 1Q

2016 results showed operational improvements, but have no immediate impact on

the company's Baa3 issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings, the (P)Baa3 senior

unsecured MTN rating of its Medium Term Note Program rating, and the negative

rating outlook.











 "LGE improved its operating margins to 3.8% in 1Q 2016 from 2.4% in 4Q 2015,

despite persistently tough market conditions," says Joe Morrison, a Moody's Vice

President and Senior Credit Officer.







 The company's home appliance and air solution (H&A) division reported a

4.1-percentage-point increase in operating margins quarter-on-quarter to 9.7%,

as a result of favorable raw material prices and an improved product mix.







 Moreover, its home entertainment (HE) division reported a 5.4-percentage-point

increase in operating margins quarter-on-quarter to 7.7% due to increased sales

of its premium products, as well as decreased costs due to falling panel prices.









 The improved performances of its H&A and HE divisions were partially offset by

the loss in LGE's mobile communications (MC) division, caused in turn by lower

shipments and marketing expenses related to the launch of its G5 mobile phone.







 Moody's expects the profitability in its MC division to improve in 2Q 2016 due

to the strong sales outlook for the G5 model.







 "Despite the solid results at LGE in 1Q 2016, the weak performance at its

37.9%-owned subsidiary LG Display Co., Ltd (LGD, unrated) continues to drag on

LGE's credit profile," adds Morrison, who is also the lead analyst for LGE.







 LG Display reported a 95% year-on-year decline in operating income to KRW40

billion in 1Q 2016 from KRW744 billion in 1Q 2015 as a result of continued

declines in panel pricing. As a result, LGD's reported operating margins fell to

0.7% from 10.6% during the same period.







 According to management, panel prices have started to stabilize in 2Q 2016.

Nevertheless, Moody's expects LGD's profitability to remain pressured over the

next 12 months due to the current supply/demand imbalance in the LCD panel

market and persistent and growing competition from Chinese manufacturers which

have a lower cost base.







 As a result of LGD's weakened profitability, Moody's estimates that LGE's

adjusted debt/EBITDA -- including the pro rata consolidation of LGD -- increased

modestly to 2.8x for the 12 months ended March 2016 from 2.6x in 2015.







 The increase in financial leverage is largely in line with expectations and

positions the company at the weak end of the Baa3 rating category.







 If LGE can demonstrate its ability to improve profitability on a sustained

basis, while also limiting earnings erosion at LGD, this development will be

positive for its rating and outlook.
