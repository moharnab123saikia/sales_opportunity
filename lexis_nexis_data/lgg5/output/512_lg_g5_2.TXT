It is finally official. The Samsung Galaxy S7 will be launching on Sunday,
February 21, 2016.

Samsung recently sent out invites to members of the press for its February 21
Unpacked 2016 event, where we can see for sure the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. The
event will start at 7PM Barcelona time, and will be on the same day that LG
plans to reveal the G5, ahead of the MWC 2016, which brings it to two flagships
on one day.

The invite in itself was quite cryptic, but Samsung also released a short teaser
clip which featured its Gear VR headset. It is a high possibility that the
concepts of Virtual Reality will be incorporated somehow into the launch of the
event, or probably Samsung might announce something new for the Samsung Galaxy
Gear VR as well.

According to previous rumors, we can expect the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge to
be completely black and can be expected to release on the 11th of March in US
and Europe markets. If the rumors are true, Samsung would release the Galaxy S7
early, as compared to last year's S6 and S6 Edge which released almost a month
later. There are also rumors of a third version, the Galaxy S7 Plus, but it is
yet to be confirmed. As of now, we have only the 5.1 inch Galaxy S7 and the Edge
variant at 5.5 inch.

Other than Samsung, we can expect to see devices from LG and Huawei during MWC.
