New Delhi, June 1 -- LG Electronics India Ltd on Wednesday launched its flagship

modular G5 smartphone featuring a "slide-out" battery and dual rear cameras -

the only flagship device to feature dual primary cameras which work

independently.





 The primary camera is a 16MP one while there is a second 8MP camera for

wide-angle shots. LG has tuned its software for both the rear cameras to work

independently.

 For selfie-lovers, it houses a 8MP front camera.

 The Rs 52,990 device is accompanied with "LG Friends", a collection of devices

like LG CAM Plus, LG 360 CAM and LG 360 VR.

 LG G5 sports a 5.3-inch Quad HD display (2560 x 1440 pixels) featuring

always-on display technology that allows users to check time, date continuously

even when G5 is in sleep mode.

 It is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor coupled with 4GB of RAM and

32GB of in-built storage that can be expanded by up to 2TB via microSD card.

 LG G5 runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system, and is powered by a

2800mAh removable battery and weighs 159 grams.

 For connectivity, the device offers LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and NFC.

 Launched first in the Mobile World Congress in Spain earlier this year, LG G5

is also the first flagship device from the Korean firm to feature a metal

unibody design.
