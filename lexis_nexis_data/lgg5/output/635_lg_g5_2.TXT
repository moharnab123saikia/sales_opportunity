HTC 10 smartphone should strike a chord with audiophiles

HTC is hoping that this is a comeback year.



Last year's flagship, the One M9, looked like an Android iPhone and suffered

from a poorly reviewed camera that clearly caused the company to reflect on what

it cared about.



For years, HTC was known for premium design, but it felt like others had caught

up with it.



With a few smart moves and one cool new feature, HTC looks to have done enough

with this new flagship to win back some admirers and, in particular, court

audiophiles.



Name: HTC 10 Price: $999 unlocked; 2-year contract: N/A



Operating system: Android 6.0.1.



Screen (size/type): 5.2-inch Super LCD5 touchscreen, 1440 x 2560 resolution with

565 ppi pixel density.



Features: Customizable themes, USB-C charging, Quick Charge 3.0, Personal audio

profiles, support for 24-bit audio, fingerprint scanner.



Camera: 12 megapixels with Optical Image Stabilization, laser autofocus,

dual-LED flash. Front camera: five-megapixel OIS, autofocus.



Weight: 161 grams



Battery: Nonremovable li-ion 3,000 mAh battery



Competition: LG G5, Samsung Galaxy S7, iPhone 6S/6S plus



What's good: It's all-metal design, it has a larger bezel, but feels solid and

comfortable to hold. HTC's first 2K screen looks great. The camera is better in

low light with good controls.



This is a phone that is aimed at audiophiles. It supports 24-bit high-res music

files and upscales lesser audio. It is the first Android to license Apple's

Airplay, so the phone can easily cast to those type of speakers. A new feature

called Personal Audio Profiles can be set up to optimize the sound for any set

of headphones. Freestyle themes are artfully designed wallpaper that have

graphics which can be linked to apps (say goodbye to Android's grid layout). HTC

also worked with Google to cut down on some of their apps, so there's less

bloatware.



What's bad: The company has done a good job of getting rid of bloatware, but

some still remains. I'm not a fan of the company's Blinkfeed news scroll that

comes baked in. USB-C charging means you've got to pay attention to the cable,

until it becomes the true standard. It is expensive, but is priced right where

other Android flagships are.



What's interesting: Apple and HTC fought over infringing each other's patents

before they signed a 10-year licensing agreement in 2012. This phone has a USB-C

charging port and the company is working with audio company JBL to create

headphones that are powered through that connector. Apple has been rumoured to

introduce this feature in the next iPhone, but HTC has beat them to it. In this

case, a regular headphone jack remains.



The bottom line: This is an excellently designed smartphone that covers all the

basics well - excellent design, great screen, good camera and decent battery

life (augmented by quick charging) - and might really be something for

audiophiles to look at.
