Google engineer Benson Leung has recently drawn attention to the fact that two

of the latest Android-powered flagship handsets -- the HTC 10 and the LG G5 --

are not compliant with the USB Type-C specification.



According to Leung, the HTC 10 and the LG G5 handsets are equipped with

Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 technology which violates the USB Type-C

specification that has essentially been designed to make things easier and

faster. A non-compliance with the specification can apparently put smartphones

at a potential risk of catching fire.



Leung has explained that, as per the USB Type-C 3.1 specification, the range of

the Vbus line of the port should be between 4.45 and 5.25 volts. However, the

specification of the port is violated by Qualcomm's Quick Charge technology

because it increases the voltage to 9 or 12 volts.



Leung has warned: "I don't recommend any Qualcomm QC 3.0 USB type-C charger,

because any of them that claim to support QC 3.0 on a Type-C port violates the

Type-C specification. The Type-C spec specifically forbids proprietary charging

methods that try to change Vbus beyond 5V."



Leung has also pointed out the HTC 10 and the LG G5 handsets are not the only

smartphones which are non-compliant with the USB Type-C specification.
