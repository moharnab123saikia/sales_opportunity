LG Electronics Saudi Arabia, global leader and technology innovator in consumer

electronics, has showcased its latest innovations and cutting-edge technology at

the AMEX World Luxury Expo 2016. Hosted for the fourth year at the Palatial

Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh from March 30 to April 1, the event was inaugurated under

the patronage of Prince Abdulaziz Bin Ahmed Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.



LG, a platinum sponsor of the World Luxury Expo, showcased its latest luxury

masterpieces, and a selection of its high-end brands to ultra-affluent and

highly discerning audience. LG products showcased at the event included OLED

TVs, TWIN WashTM washing machines, modern refrigerators designed exclusively for

Saudi consumers, digital screens, and the first modular phone in the world LG

G5.



Known for their slim and light-weight designs, LG's OLED TVs adopt a technology

based on producing a special light that enhances the picture quality, in color

and in black and white, offering an exceptional viewing experience. LG also

showcased its TWIN WashTM washing machines, which offer users the option of

washing two loads of laundry simultaneously, in less time and with added

convenience. In addition, the exhibition visitors enjoyed the LG premium-design

refrigerators, which have an intricate design and a technology to keep food

fresh for longer. The compressor is energy efficient and is backed by a 10-year

warranty.



Visitors were also intrigued by the LG giant digital screens, given its high

definition and low energy consumption. It serves as an effective means of

interaction and communication between a company and its target audiences. On the

other hand, visitors were introduced to the distinctive features of the G5, the

wide camera, dual back cameras with separate lenses to capture different angles.

G5 is the first modular Smartphone in the world.
