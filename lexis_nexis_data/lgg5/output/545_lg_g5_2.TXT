Internet of Things centre stage at Mobile World Congress;

You could barely move without tripping over a stand that promised some form of

IoT breakthrough

Every conference needs a buzzword or phrase. In recent years, smart, connected

and social all got their turn in the spotlight, as executive after executive

trotted out the phrases on stage in an attempt to convince attendees that their

fingers really were on the pulse of the mobile industry.



This year, it was the turn of the Internet of Things. You could barely move

without tripping over a stand that promised some form of IoT breakthrough. The

phrase was used almost carelessly at times, applied to almost any old thing with

which it could have a vague connection.



The idea that everything is connected, communicating to help make life easier

and more efficient is certainly not new. It has been a feature of tech

conferences for some time now, offering a new take on how we will all live in

the coming years.



But at Mobile World Congress this year, the shift was definitely from simply a

consumer thing, with smart homes and connected cars taking the centre stage, to

how industry could benefit from the Internet of Things. That was an area where

Irish companies saw their opportunity. The show was the launchpad for Eir

Business's Internet of Things platform, which is powered by Irish company

Asavie.



The company sees the platform as a huge opportunity for its business, one that

could be worth millions in years to come.



The truth is that while mobile is still the key focus of the show, mobile phones

are not the main draw for either attendees or exhibitors.



Huawei, for example, did not debut its P9 phone as expected at the event.

Instead, it showed off a new Windows 10 tablet, the MateBook. An update to its

flagship phone is likely to come later in the year, at a separate event.



Sony may have debuted the X series phones, but the Xperia Z range was left as it

was. Of the major phone manufacturers, it was left to Samsung, LG to provide the

bit handset announcements of the show: Samsung with the S7 and S7 Edge, and LG

with the modular G5.



Chinese firm Xiaomi, in its first time at Mobile World Congress, also unveiled a

new flagship smartphone, while Alcatel debuted the Idol 4.



The Barcelona event may have been the platform for a number of key launches in

recent years, but you get the impression that the annual Consumer Electronics

Show in Las Vegas may have stolen its thunder a little in terms of big launches

this year.



Although more than 100,000 people are expected to walk through the doors of the

Fira Gran Via, that number is still eclipsed by the attendance at CES.



Michael O'Hara of GSMA (Groupe Speciale Mobile Association) said the show was

primarily about businesses and, with more than 5,000 chief executives attending,

the GSMA was happy Mobile World Congress was fulfilling its mandate.



Among those chief executives was Mark Zuckerberg. The Facebook founder was on

stage on Sunday to help Samsung launch its new products in virtual reality, with

Samsung's Gear VR - powered by Oculus technology - playing a starring role at

the event.



In addition to the S7 Edge, Samsung was unveiling its Gear 360 camera, which is

designed to capture and share footage from two 180-degree lenses.



Zuckerberg outlined why he was backing the Gear VR as solution for consumers who

wanted a less expensive way to get into VR, describing it as the best mobile

virtual reality headset. The key to that, he said, Samsung's OLED screens for

its phones, the display for the headset.



He told the audience that VR was the future of sharing, outlining how things had

developed from the time he took his first steps; his daughter's will be captured

not on film, but with a 360-degree camera that will capture the entire scene.



Facebook is also experimenting with new ways to bring VR to consumers, with

dynamic streaming for its 360 videos that will quadruple the video resolution

while cutting the bandwidth needed to stream the immersive content.



LG was also jumping into virtual reality, announcing a headset ahead of the

start of Mobile World Congress. Even Alcatel got in on the act with its Idol 4

phone packaging that turns into a VR headset.



The discussion on 5G was not only dominated by the Internet of Things and how it

would facilitate the next generation of connected devices, but also how it would

help with sharing content from cameras such as Samsung's device.



But could virtual reality be a similar fad - and suffer a similar fate - as 3D?

It's not unthinkable. A few years ago at CES and games exhibition E3, everyone

was pushing 3D as the next great frontier for the entertainment industry,

offering TVs and smartphones that took advantage of the new technology.

Attendees at press conferences were presented with 3D glasses and urged to wear

them for special presentations, leaving a good chunk of the audience nauseated.

Fast forward a few years and there are only a few stragglers trying to push

"glass-less" 3D to a disinterested audience.



It is difficult to gauge exactly what will grab the most attention in the wake

of Mobile World Congress, but one topic that wasn't going away was adblocking.

Operators are about to break new ground. Three is to start blocking ads on its

UK and Italy networks, allowing customers to choose what is relevant to them, a

move that is sure to spark controversy among advertising networks and publishers

alike.



The company is partnering with Israeli start-up Shine to carry out its strategy,

forcing a rethink in the industry. The move is ostensibly to stop consumers

having to suffer through irrelevant advertising and paying for the privilege in

the form of their data allowances, but the whispers around the show floor

indicate that adblocking technology is being seen as having less altruistic

motives for network operators who are tired of investing money in their

infrastructure, only to have other companies make money of the back of it.



With 5G networks set to begin their rollout in the coming years, you can see why

operators are starting to get a little jittery about getting the most out of

their investment. One firm that was eager to make the most of the opportunity

was Unlockd, a platform that claimed to be the antidote to adblocking. It offers

a discount to customers on their mobile bills in return for allowing

geo-targeted display ads every third time the user unlocks their mobile phone

screen.



If the show was all about the evolution of mobile, the payments industry

certainly needs to get a look in. Several months after separating from Ebay,

Paypal announced somewhat of a turnaround when it revealed a new app that uses

near-field communications to turn phones into digital wallets, interacting with

existing contactless payment terminals.



The new function is set to roll out in the US and Australia first.



It is a it of a turnaround from Ebay president - then chief executive - John

Donahoe and his assessment of "Not For Commerce" some years ago.



"We didn't dismiss it," said Paypal's head of communications Rob Skinner. "We

had some experiments with NFC in our app four or five years ago. Ultimately

consumers didn't care, there were very few places you could use it." That has

changed in recent years, with contactless payments on public transport in London

kickstarting a surge towards NFC payments that Paypal has followed.



There are other plans to put the mobile phone at the heart of payments. "NFC

works in some situations but it doesn't work in all," said Paypal's consumer

produce and engineering vice president Joanna Lambert. "That's where in-app

payments will come in. There's so many different opportunities to improve the

experience."



MasterCard, meanwhile, said it would begin to use "selfies" to verify online

payments, with the additional security check of being asked to blink to prove

they are a real person and not a photograph. Anyone who has been burned by the

verified Visa system in the past may welcome this development, which also offers

the opportunity to use biometric authenticators such as fingerprints.



Research from Ovum found there will be more than 2 billion users of mobile

commerce by 2019, up from almost 453 million in 2014.



"Smartphones have become a platform that can support the whole shopping journey,

from product search and discovery, through comparisons and recommendations, to

payments," said Eden Zoller, Ovum's principle analyst in consumer services and

payments.



Although Mobile World Congress is winding down for this year, it's clear the

hard work is just getting started.
