LG G5-'Modular' At A Price

We got our hands on the newest flagship smartphone, launched yesterday by the

South Korean electronics giant, and realised there is a catch to the Modular

offering.



LG has unveiled its latest addition to its premier 'G' series with the launch of

G5 smartphone in India with a host of accessories including the LG Cam Plus, LG

360 CAM as well as a Virtual Reality headset.



First Impressions



The device, priced at INR 52,990, at its first glance manages to impress with

its silver metallic housing, with a circular power button mounted at its rear

panel, which also serves as a Finger print sensor.



On the top right, rests a 3.5 mm headphone jack, while the volume rocker and the

speaker have been integrated on the left and bottom of the device panel.



The G5 on the display front offers a 5.3 inch quad HD IPS display, offering

vivid colors and crystal clear resolution while playing videos or just browsing

through images.



There are also 'two' camera lens (Yes, you heard it right!) mounted at the rear

of the device which includes a primary 16MP camera along with an 8MP camera for

a wide angle view, separated by an LED flash.



We managed to capture some random snaps in both its standard as well as wide

angle mode, and had to admit that LG has blessed the G5 with one among the best

camera optics in the flagship segment. The wide angle mode captured images with

an exceptional difference and can certainly be called as one of the best USP of

the device.



The device's much touted modular capability by LG however comes at a price as

the three external modules including the Cam Plus, 360 Cam and the Virtual

Reality headset come at an additional price tag of INR 6500, INR 19500 and INR

18900 respectively.



LG has also announced some other Interesting modules for the G5 including an

external B&O speaker which integrates with the device via pulling out its

battery slot at the bottom, and the Rolling Bot which comes a ball shaped home

surveillance robot operated by a dedicated smartphone app. Both the accessories

however will not be available in India for the time being.



LG also says that unlike its recently launched mid-range smartphones, the K7 and

K10 LTE, G5 will not be assembled in India, being a flagship offering.



Verdict



While the G5 left us impressed in the first impressions round, with its

astounding camera capabilities, a well build architecture and a vivid display.

We wouldn't call the modular compatibility of the device as its biggest USP

though (at least till we don't perform a full scale review of it) particularly

with the significant additional costs which they bring along.
