NEW DELHI: South Korean electronics company LG Electronics Inc. (LG) today

announced second-quarter 2016 operating income of KRW 584.6 billion (USD 503.10

million), nearly 140 percent higher than the previous year, from strong

performance by the Home Appliance & Air Solution and Home Entertainment

companies, both reporting the highest quarterly operating profit in LG's

history. Global consolidated revenues of KRW 14 trillion (USD 12.05 billion)

increased both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.



LG Home Appliance & Air Solution Company accounted for the largest share of the

second quarter's operating profit with KRW 433.7 billion (USD 373.24 million).

Revenues of KRW 4.70 trillion (USD 4.04 billion), an increase of 4.8 percent

from the second quarter last year, were driven by growth in B2B sales of air

conditioning systems and strong overall performance in Korea, Europe and Asia.

With an improved product portfolio and cost structure, the business unit was

able to achieve an operating margin of more than 9 percent. Going forward,

premium products such as the LG SIGNATURE collection, TWINWash and LG Styler are

expected to contribute positively to the performance of the company.



LG Mobile Communications Company saw revenues of KRW 3.33 trillion (USD 2.86

billion) increase 12 percent from the first quarter, while declining from the

same period the year before. An operating loss of KRW 153.5 billion (USD 132.10

million) reflected increased marketing expenditures and somewhat slow initial

sales of G5 smartphone. Overall smartphone shipments increased 3 percent from

the previous quarter with a total of 13.9 million smartphones shipped in the

second quarter. The launch of the new V series and expanding sales of mass-tier

K and X series models are expected to improve the business unit's performance

next quarter.



LG Home Entertainment Company reported a record KRW 356.7 billion (USD 306.97

million) in operating profit on revenues of KRW 4.16 trillion (USD 3.58

billion), a 5.7 percent increase from the 2015 second quarter, in large part

thanks to the growing market for premium TVs. An increase in sales of higher-end

ULTRA HD and OLED TVs and improved cost structure management contributed to an

operating margin of 8.6 percent, the highest in the history of LG's home

entertainment division. The business unit will continue to benefit from the

growing UHD and OLED TV markets and cost competitiveness, although cost

increases for flat-panel components may affect profitability.



LG Vehicle Components Company reported sales of KRW 639.6 billion (USD 550.4

million), an increase of 42 percent from the same period the previous year,

thanks to high growth in the automotive infotainment sector. Increased R&D

investments in infotainment and electric vehicle technologies, however,

contributed to an operating loss of KRW 16.8 billion (USD 14.46 million) in the

quarter. The outlook for LG's automotive component business is positive with

production of components for the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle commencing in

the third quarter.



LG Electronics' unaudited quarterly earnings results are based on IFRS

(International Financial Reporting Standards) for the three-month period ending

June 30, 2016. Amounts in Korean won (KRW) are translated into U.S. dollars

(USD) at the average rate of the three-month period of the corresponding quarter

KRW 1,162 per USD.
