Look like the G5 will be getting the latest Android OS



Recent rumors suggest that the LG G5 might be in line to get an OTA update to

Android 7.0 sometime in November.



According to a report from the newly refreshed Android Software Updates support

page from Optus, the listing for the G5 shows Android 7.0 in the testing phase,

and is expected to come out for G5 users by mid-November. Earlier, as part of a

preview program, LG allowed  a small number of LG G5 owners in South Korea a way

to get the Android 7.0 update.



However, you need to keep in mind that system update schedules from wireless

carriers are not always reliable, and they can change. On the other hand, LG is

known to be among the first smartphone companies to roll out Android OS updates

for their older devices in the past, making this schedule more believable.



The G5 was LG's flagship for this year, which launched along with the "Friends"

accessories. including camera and speaker modules, that connected directly to

the phone. However, the LG G5 was something of a sales disappointment for the

company. LG hopes to bounce back with the launch its latest smartphone, the LG

V20, which comes with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. will officially launch

on October 28 in the US.
