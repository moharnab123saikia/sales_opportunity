NEW DELHI: HTC has finally made its latest flagship smartphone, HTC 10, official

in India. The metal bodied handset is priced at Rs 52,990 and is already up for

pre-order, with shipping starting June 5. HTC 10 was launched along with five

other smartphones, namely the One X9 , Desire 628, Desire 830, Desire 630 and

Desire 825.The flagship HTC 10 was unveiled globally last month. With it, the

company has ditched the 'One' moniker that has been always there in its flagship

handsets since the launch of the original HTC One. However, the HTC 10 still

keeps its premium metal build has even improved upon it this time.Not only are

the specifications top-notch on paper, the overall package seems impressive too.



We played with the smartphone at the launch event for a limited time, and here

are our first impressions.Design and displayThe HTC 10 is one of the best

smartphones we have come across, when it comes to build quality. The metal

phone, although being slightly heavier than competing flagships, seems solid and

sturdy in the hand.The Taiwanese smartphone maker also showcased a small video

showing the handset surviving numerous drops without any major scratches. The

phone sports broad metal chamfered edges on the sides, making for a firm

grip.There's a headphone jack on top, a micro USB Type-C port at the bottom,

power button and volume rocker on the right and a camera bump at the back. The

camera bump, however, is more pronounced than what we have seen in flagships

like Samsung Galaxy S7 or Apple iPhone 6s . HTC 10, with its metal unibody build

and dual-textured finish, left us impressed during the short time we spent with

the device. Fingerprint sensor worked accurately as well.The flagship comes with

a 5.2-inch QHD (1440x2560 pixel resolution) Super LCD 5 display with a pixel

density of 564ppi. It has really good viewing angles, and the Corning Gorilla

Glass protected curved edge display is responsive.At the launch event, HTC

claimed that the handset's display has the best touch response when compared to

that of iPhone 6S , Sony Xperia Z5 and the Samsung Galaxy S7 . Since it's a

matter of milliseconds, it might not be visible to the end users anyway. The

display is really bright and a bit reflective as well.Camera and performanceWe

tried the HTC 10's rear camera and it performed really well. We were especially

impressed with the camera's colour reproduction and its ability to click images

within a snap, even in dim and artificially lighted conditions For those

unaware, the smartphone houses a 12MP UltraPixel 2 camera with a pixel size of

1.55um, meaning more light is captured in one shot. This results in relatively

brighter images, especially in low light conditions. The rear autofocus camera

works in tandem with the BSI sensor, optical image stabilization and f/1.8

aperture to capture clear and sharp images.



Some of the camera modes in the HTC 10 include Self Timer, Auto-HDR, Panorama,

Continuous shooting (up to 8 frames per second) and Hyperlapse.The front-facing

camera also performed well. In our limited testing, the HTC 10 gave decent

results with its 5MP front-facing autofocus camera. The wide-angle front-facing

camera also has a BSI sensor with optical image stabilization.There's nothing

much to comment about the smartphone's performance as of yet. We ran a couple of

heavy gaming apps, and the smartphone powered its way through them without any

stuttering or lag. HTC 10 runs on a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor,

clubbed with 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU.It is too early to jump to any

conclusions, though. We have used smartphones running on the latest Snapdragon

820 before, and all of them have worked great. To find out more about the

detailed performance of HTC 10 in different situations, stay tuned for our full

review. As for the software, it is Android 6.0 Marshmallow with HTC's Sense UI

baked on top.VerdictOur initial impressions of the HTC 10 are really positive.

The smartphone sports a premium build and feels great in the hand. On the

software side of things, the phone comes with all the latest features found in

Android 6.0 Marshmallow and adds some extra functionality to the mix as well,

thanks to the Sense UI. Though in our opinion, the Rs 52,990 price tag might

drive some consumers away. You can go for the LG G5 which has slightly better

rear and front-facing cameras, same processor and bigger QHD display, all at the

same price. Should you buy the HTC 10? Stay tuned for the review.
