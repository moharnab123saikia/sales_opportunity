

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has lifted the lid on the social network's
plans to get millions of users sharing virtual reality videos.

In a surprise appearance at Samsung's launch event last night at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona, Zuckerberg said virtual reality would become "the most
social platform".

Facebook bought virtual reality headset maker Oculus Rift for $2 billion in 2014
and has partnered with Samsung, which launched a 360-degree camera designed for
use with its Gear VR headset.

Resembling an eyeball, the Gear 360 camera allows users to take high-definition
360-degree photos and video and beam them to the headset via a phone clipped
into it.

Zuckerberg called virtual reality the "next important computing platform that
has the potential to change all our lives". "One day soon all of us are going to
have the power to broadcast live what we're doing, whenever we want," he said.

The $99 headsets will be given away free with pre-orders of the S7, but not on
Three. Samsung also launched its new waterproof S7 smartphone.

Fellow smartphone giant HTC was also unveiling virtual reality technology with
its new headset. The Vive VR was launched at the same time as HTC's Desire 530
handset yesterday.

It will go on sale in the US first for $799 before UK pre-orders open later this
month.

HTC's rival LG also launched the G5, its first "modular smartphone", with a 360
virtual reality headset and accompanying wide-angle camera.

One of its accessories is the "Rolling Bot", with an 8MP camera for home
monitoring that also be used to play with cats and dogs remotely while speaking
to them via an internal speaker. It features a laser for them to chase around
the room while being controlled remotely by the owner.
