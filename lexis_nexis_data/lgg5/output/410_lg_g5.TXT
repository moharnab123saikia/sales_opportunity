LENGTH: 353 words





[THE INVESTOR] LG Electronics saw its operating income soar nearly 140 percent

on-year to 584.6 billion won (US$519.7 million) in the April-June period on the

back of strong sales of home appliances and air-conditioning systems, the

company said in its earnings report on July 28.



The company's revenue came in at 14 trillion won, up 0.6 percent from a year

earlier.

LG's home appliance & air solution unit and home entertainment unit -- two of

the tech giant's four core business pillars -- posted a record high operating

profit of 433.7 billion won and 356.7 billion won, respectively, in the second

quarter.



The operating income figures increased 4.8 percent and 5.7 percent,

respectively.



The HAA unit posted 4.7 trillion won in revenue, up 4.8 percent on-year while

the HE unit logged 4.16 trillion won in revenue, up 5.7 percent compared to a

year earlier.



The company attributed the improved operating profit of the two businesses to

increased sales of its high-end products including the LG Signature collection,

and the TwinWah washer.



LG's mobile division, however, suffered an operating loss of 153.5 billion won

due to increased marketing costs and a sales slump for its latest flagship G5

smartphone. Its revenue came in at 3.26 trillion won, down 6.2 year-over-year.



Overall smartphone shipments increased 3 percent from the previous quarter with

a total of 13.9 million smartphones shipped in the second quarter.



"The launch of the new V series and expanding sales of the K and X series models

are expected to improve the mobile business unit's performance next quarter,"

the company said.



Although the tech firm's vehicle component business achieved a 42-percent sales

hike to US$639.6 billion, compared to the same period last year, it posted an

operating loss of 16.8 billion won in the second quarter.



The firm offered a positive outlook on the vehicle components segment in the

third quarter when General Motors' electric vehicle, Chevrolet Bolt, equipped

with LG's components will be launched in the quarter.
