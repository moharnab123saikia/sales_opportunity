The LG G5 is already on its way, and rumors having started making rounds around

the Internet.



According to GSM Arena, the G5 might be launching very soon. No official

information regarding the specs have come from the company, but rumors and leaks

suggest that it will have a 5.6 inch QHD resolution IPS LCD display of 1440 x

2560 pixels. It is rumored to run on a 64 bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 and a

battery of 3000 to 3500 mAh. It may also be running on 3GB of RAM.



While its predecessor had an optional leather back, the G5 is expected to sport

a classier metal unibody. It will also have an enhanced camera of 20 to 21

megapixels and a front facing camera of 8 megapixels. It is rumored to have

biometric security, such as an iris scanner to unlock the phone. A fingerprint

scanner may also be found.

over Samsung who will is expected to reveal the Galaxy S7 that month. Price

details and confirmed specs are yet to be revealed.
