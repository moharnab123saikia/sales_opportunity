LG Electronics India Limited (LGEIL), on Friday announced the launch of its

latest smartphone, LG X Cam in India. The X Cam is designed to deliver

exceptional value to those who want a smartphone with a unique feature such as a

Dual camera, that too at an affordable price. Like the LG G5, the X cam inherits

a similar 120-degree wide angle lens to complement the standard lens. The 13MP

standard angle lens and the 5MP wide angle camera on the rear of the X cam

delivers as wide a field of view as the human eye, basically it captures 53%

more area than the traditional cameras on the smartphones.



The X cam offers Pop-out Picture feature which combines the two images taken

with the standard and wide angle lenses to create a picture-in-a-frame effect.

Available only on the X cam & Panorama View automatically scrolls a wide image

instead of a static image and the Signature feature allows users to add a

caption or byline after taking a photo.



"With X Cam, we are giving consumers a Dual camera smartphone at a reasonable

price point. We are sure that the Indian consumers will like the very rare in

smartphones, 'wide angle' feature, something that has been inherited from our

premium smartphone LG G5. This 'wide angle' photography would be a unique

experience in this segment and consumers shall surely embrace this new

experience, which otherwise is possible only with nature gifted eyes," said Amit

Gujral, Marketing Head - Mobiles, LG India.



LG X Screen will be priced in India at Rs. 19,990 and will be available from

today across stores in India.
