Barcelona | At an event held at the International Convention Centre in Barcelona

last Sunday night, Samsung created what it said was the largest virtual reality

happening in history, handing out thousands of virtual reality headsets and

asking everyone to don them at the same time.



The event, part of the Mobile World Congress, was to launch Samsung's latest

flagship phone, the Galaxy S7. Customers quick to pre-order the phone were told

they would get the same virtual reality headset, known as a Gear VR, free of

charge.



That same weekend, the low-cost mobile phone maker Alcatel announced that its

latest phone, the Idol 4, would come encased in a virtual reality headset as

part of its packaging.



HTC, another phone maker, announced pricing and availability for its highly

anticipated virtual reality headset, the HTC Vive. And LG announced a virtual

reality headset known as the LG 360 VR, which will be a companion device for its

new G5 flagship phone.



At the Samsung happening, Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and CEO of Facebook,

snuck on to the stage while everyone was distracted by the alternate reality in

their VR headsets and said that he expected 360-degree video, which you need a

virtual reality headset to watch, would become the dominant way people will

share videos on Facebook in years to come.



You could be forgiven for thinking that the mobile telecommunications industry's

biggest trade show was all about virtual reality this year. But in actual

reality, it was not.



With Apple commanding almost all of the profits in the mobile phone industry -

analysts at Canaccord Genuity estimate that Apple accounted for 91 per cent of

reported profit in the phone industry last year, despite selling only 17.2 per

cent of phones - this year's Mobile World Congress was all about turning the

public's attention away from just mobile phones and towards the growing

ecosystem of products and services that surround a mobile phone, where the rest

of the phone industry hopes it can start making money.



Virtual reality is an easy-to-sell, low-cost part of the ecosystem (most VR

headsets that work with mobile phones are little more than two lenses in a

case), but it's far from the whole story.



LG, which like most Android phone makers has struggled to find an audience for

its phones, launched its 360 VR headset as just part of a new ecosystem play it

called "Friends". Other LG Friends include a phone-controlled robot, the Rolling

Bot, and an attachment for phones that makes it easier to control drones.



So keen is LG on building a profitable ecosystem around its phones that it even

made the G5 modular, with a bottom end that snaps off to accommodate other

Friends such as a camera grip and an audio amplifier made by Bang & Olufsen.



Sony, which has a virtual reality headset for its PlayStation games console,

announced an even more drastic pivot for its struggling mobile phone business.

Rather than just build devices around the mobile phone, it's hoping to overcome

the lack of profitability in the sector by not just modularising the phone, but

deconstructing the notion of the phone and devolving its functions back into a

new ecosystem of products.



At the show, Sony announced a suite of new devices, starting with the Xperia Ear

but eventually going on to include the Xperia Eye, the Xperia Projector and the

Xperia Agent, which are designed to literally take the focus off the smartphone.



Rather than having to look at the screen of a phone to get the weather, for

instance, consumers wearing Sony's Xperia Ear, an earpiece designed to be worn

all day, will be told the weather forecast automatically by a voice in their

ear. The first generation of Sony's devices will need to be paired with a mobile

phone in order to retrieve information such as weather forecasts and incoming

messages, but Sony officials told AFR Weekend that later versions will probably

have their own connection direct to the internet, avoiding the need for a phone

altogether for certain functions we now think of as smartphone functions.



That part of Sony's plan could take years to execute, however, because it's

likely it would need new, so-called 5G phone networks, which are designed to

work with a multitude of low-cost, low-power devices, not just smartphones.



Telstra said it would trial a 5G phone network at the Commonwealth Games on the

Gold Coast in 2018. Although, of course, if the efforts to take the spotlight

away from the smartphone are successful, we won't think of it as a phone network

by then. It will be a network for all manner of things.



The smartphone, if it still exists as we now know it, will just be one of them.
