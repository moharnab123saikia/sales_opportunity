Modular and all, the LG G5 is what you want it to be

FROM being the first major-brand smartphone with a modular design to hit the

market, to being the first all-metal handset in LG's award-winning G series, the

LG G5 is-and can be-a lot of things.



This new flagship designed with ambitions to innovate, or, at least, dare to

change the way we look at the smartphones (a classic LG move, must we say), came

away as darling at the Mobile World Congress 2016 in February, besting Samsung's

Galaxy S7 and Xiaomi's Mi5, among others, to win the Best New Smartphone honors.

And with good reason at that.



Despite what might seem as a design that's unsexy, this daring model packs

eye-popping camera features, a perfectly proportioned size and weight that feels

great on hand, and, more important, fluid performance.



The moment we got our hands on this new shiny device, we skipped the undercards

and went straight for the main event by tinkering with its modularity, which is

easily its most interesting feature. Removing the detachable lower chin requires

two hands (one to press the recessed button at the lower left side to pop the

module, and the other to pull it out) plus, as we found out, a surprising amount

of force.



To say the ejection shouldn't be too easy to avoid unwanted disintegration is

fair, but for it to demand that much effort all but confirms the design still

has ways to go.



The 'Magic Slot' can be fitted with modules and peripherals called 'LG Friends'

that cater to various interests. For those who want to take smartphone

photography to the next level, there's the LG Cam Plus that transforms the

handset into a camera in terms of feel and performance, and adds control to the

model's impressive snapping power. Features include a dedicated shutter button,

a zoom dial and an additional 1,200 mAh on top of its built-in 2,800 mAh pack.



And since we're talking about its battery, the G5's registers 200 mAhs smaller

than that of its predecessor's. It can still get through a day of usage, but the

effects of the downgrade can certainly be felt, but is made bearable by

QuickCharge 3.0 technology, which juices up the handset to full in just around

80 minutes and can reach 50 percent as fast as under 30 minutes. Of course, if

all else fails, dried-out batteries of the modular-designed G5 can be swapped

with fully charged one in a jiffy.



Going back to the modules, audiophiles are sure to befriend the LG Hi-Fi Plus

that was made in collaboration with high-end Danish audio designer and

manufacturer Bang and Olfusen. This module features a 32-bit Digital-to-Analog

Converter, an amplifier and audio up-sampling of up to 384 kHz.



There are also stand-alone modules that do not need to physically slot into the

G5, like the Bluetooth-connecting 360 degree VR camera LG 360 CAM; the tethered

reality headset LG 360 VR and the multipurpose LG Rolling Bot.



Much like the G5's modular nature, its built and design are also unprecedented,

especially in LG's G series. Instead of going with plastic/leather of the G4,

the G5 is of metal build. While the change is an improvement over its

predecessor, it falls a tad short against its competitors in terms of premium

feel. The signature curve of LG's G series is also noticeably absent in this

latest flagship that takes some oomph in its style. The volume rockers have also

been relocated to the sides from the back.



But to be fair, the changes seems necessary for this radical device, as

function, after all, is what LG apparently set its sights on in designing the

G5. What we like is the fingerprint sensor with regards to reactive efficiency,

thanks to a thorough scanning process and its placement at the rear.



The power button is still at the back of the handset, like in the G4 and G3

before it, but now doubles as the sensor that turns an, otherwise, idle

stabilizing index finger in one-hand usage to a convenient unlocking mechanism.

Moreover, when you put the phone down at your desk, there's no need to lift it

to unlock the device because of a handy knock-code feature that only requires

the user to tap the screen in a personalized pattern.



More on usability: grip earns this device plus points. At 159 grams and 149.4 x

73.9 x 7.7 millimeters, the G5 offers just-right proportions. It carries a

5.3-inch IPS LCD display with a Quad HD resolution, quite smaller than the G4's

5.5-incher, but the reduced size is too paltry to be noticed even by your

average size junkie, especially with a much raved-about camera performance,

which brings us to our next point.



There's just about as much emphasis put on the G5's modular nature as to its

cameras. The handset comes off the heels of strong reviews for the cameras of

its LG siblings, the G4 and V10, and it's more than safe to say that the G5 runs

away with the torch. The new flagship is marked by a dual-camera set-up, which

takes a page from the V10's double front lenses. However, the G5's pair of eyes

is placed at the rear with a 16 megapixel sensor equipped with OIS and f/1.8

aperture and another that's an 8-MP sensor with f/2.4 aperture and wide-angle

135째 field of view (!). Of course, there's also a single 8-MP selfie camera up

front with f/2.0 aperture.



We don't disagree with those who say the G5's show-stealing camera game is its

strongest suit by turning in solid captures that come with excellent detail.

While the 16-MP main camera is more than capable of capturing images with the

clearest detail, the second rear camera is the one that has caught our eye with

its wide shots. And by wide, take this: its field of view spans 135째, while the

human eye sits to about 120째 to 124째.



Whether getting the complete picture of a beach with a shoreline's extended

stretch, or a concert's wide crowd, stage setup and night-sky backdrop, the

possibilities are endless with the G5. It's the dream scenario for those who

somehow always get cut-off in group photos-and a nightmare situation for people

who dread photo bombers.



The camera app offers the same extensive interface with the robust manual mode

making a return in the G5, to go with the casual photographer's auto-mode and

other interesting features such as the multiview that operates all three lenses

at once.



The songs of praise can be extended to the G5's software that operates on

Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. LG's 'substance over style' mantra also runs across

the G5's refined performance department where users of previous LG models may

get caught off-guard. Gone is the app drawer and what's left is a much cleaner

and less intrusive interface. When not in use, the time, date and other

notifications are still viewable, thanks to the Always On display feature,

albeit one that's still a work in progress with small icons and illegibility in

the bright outdoors.



As for the specs, the G5's can keep up with the best of them. It features the

Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, Adreno 530 GPU and 4GB of RAM that translate to

silky-smooth animations and multitasking operations, without any visible lags.

What's more, the G5 includes a microSD card slot with adoptable storage that can

give a huge boost to its standard 32GB configuration.



All in all, it remains to be seen if the G5's modular design is just the tip of

the iceberg for the whole smart-phone industry or the entirety of a melting one.

But for all the forgivable fizzles of the G5's innovations, the sizzle of the

strengths of LG's newest flagship definitely leaves a much stronger impression.
