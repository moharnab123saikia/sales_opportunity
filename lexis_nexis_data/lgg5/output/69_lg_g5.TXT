LG Electronics releases another teaser for G5 -



LENGTH: 233 words





LG Electronics Inc. on Wednesday released another teaser for its upcoming

flagship G5 smartphone, providing a glimpse of the design and features for the

first time.



The 10-second video showed an outline of the G5 smartphone, with the phrase

"Always ON." The company also wrote the phrase "Never go asleep while others do"

on its social-network pages.



LG Electronics had earlier released a handful of teaser posters for the G5

smartphone, but none had provided details on features.



The "Always ON" feature was first introduced through the V10 smartphone last

year, which came with a dual display, with the smaller one on top displaying

core information, such as battery status on a 24-hour basis.



Industry watchers said LG Electronics may have adopted the "Always ON" screen in

the center of the display for better readability, compared with the V10

smartphone.



Earlier this month, LG Electronics sent out three invitations that read, "Come

meet new friends on the playground," featuring balloon animals, toy robots and

air dancers.



The G5 smartphone will be introduced on Feb. 21, a day before the opening of the

Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. On the same day, LG's bigger rival

Samsung Electronics Co. will showcase its presumed Galaxy S7 in Barcelona.



LG is rumored to be adopting a metal body for the G5 to improve design, as the

predecessor G4's leather case did not appeal to users. (Yonhap)
