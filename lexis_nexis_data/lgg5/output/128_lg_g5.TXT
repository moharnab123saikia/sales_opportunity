With the launch of the Huawei P9, it looks as though smartphones are starting

down a path that will eventually see dual cameras as standard fare. Indeed, the

P9 is not the first handset this year to feature a dual rear camera and, if

rumours are are to be believed, it certainly won't be the last.



So let's compare the new kid on the bock with it's slightly older cousin, the LG

G5, released earlier in April. At first look, both devices have largely similar

specifications, though there are some key differences.



The Huawei P9 packs a 2.5GHz HiSilicon Kirin 955 octa-core processor, with a

Mali-T880MP4 GPU, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB internal storage (expandable to 128GB).

The LG G5 meanwhile has a 2.15GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Quad-core processor,

with an Adreno 530 GPU, 4GB RAM, and 32GB storage (expandable up to 256GB). Both

smartphones offer expandable storage via a hybrid second nano SIM slot.



As far as the display and cameras go, the P9 features a 5.2-inch full HD

(1920x1080) display at 423ppi. It has dual 12MP f/2.2 rear cameras with phase

detection autofocus and dual-tone LED flash, and a 8MP f/2.4 front cam. The G5

has a 5.3-inch quad HD (2560x1440) display at 554ppi and a 8MP f/2.0 front cam.

The G5 also features a dual camera setup, with a 16MP f/1.8 and a 8MP f/2.4

camera on the rear, but not for the same function as the P9. But we'll get to

that in a bit.



Lastly, the P9 is powered by a 3000mAh battery and runs EMUI 4.1 on top of

Android 6.0. The G5 meanwhile is powered by a smaller 2800mAh battery and runs

UXUI 5.0 running on Android 6.0 Both smartphones have dual SIM and $G support,

as well as an integrated fingerprint scanner.



While the Huawei P9 might rank slightly higher with their choice of processor

and battery size, it's really with the camera that it outshines the LG G5. The

G5's secondary rear camera is an 8MP wide angle. Smartphone cameras are locked

at a zoom level, because there's no way to properly integrate a lens zoom into

the minimal space available, and digital zoom trades off on quality. The wide

angle then serves to incorporate a wider frame in the picture, while the main

camera can capture details.



In the case of the P9. both rear cameras are 12MP but work in tandem for a

picture. One sensor captures colour input for the image, while the other

measures the lighting in the scene. Both images are then integrated into the

final photo, helping to preserve quality. It's thanks to this that we believe

the P9 makes the superior smartphone, on top of which it's also the cheaper

option. The P9 costs Rs 39,999 to the G5's Rs 47,990.



The Huawei P9 is available right now exclusively on FLipkart, or offline at

Croma. The device comes with Ceramic White, Prestige Gold Haze Gold, Rose Gold,

Mystic Silver and Titanium Grey colour option
