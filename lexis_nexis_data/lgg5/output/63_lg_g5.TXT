Android 7.0 Nougat coming to LG G5 early



LENGTH: 194  words





Early Preview Program brings Android 7.0 to LG G5



Are you an LG G5 user eagerly waiting to get Android 7.0 on your device? Well

you are in luck, if you are in South Korea that is.



LG as launched a new "Preview Program" on the LG U+ network that will let G5

owners get an early taste of Android 7.0 Nougat. The window for the chance is

even smaller, as there is room only for 2000 users, which will be selected on a

first come first serve basis. More than just letting users try out Android 7.0

Nougat, the Preview Program also serves as a platform for users to report bugs

and feedback so that LG can make sure that the official rollout of Nougat on the

device is as smooth as Google would want it to be.



There is still no formal word on when the Android 7.0 OS will come to the LG G5.

Nexus users will be getting it in September, followed by Samsung. Although LG

has been quite late historically, this time it might be different. Users

interested in being a part of the Preview Program can register on the LG OS

preview app after downloading it via the LG promo page (Korean). Registration

started on August 16th, and will continue until all 2000 slots are filled.
