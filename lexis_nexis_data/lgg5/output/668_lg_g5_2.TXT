Small-car sales track gas price, up and down

Canadian auto research guru Dennis DesRosiers has compared gas price levels and

entry-level vehicle sales, finding that the two correlate very closely, and not

only when gas prices go up, but more surprisingly when they go down as well.



"So we have a consumer that for months and months sees fuel prices rising and

the moment fuel prices do go down, if even for a month, the consumer goes out

and buys a larger vehicle," wrote DesRosiers in a research note about his

findings.



"It is almost as if they are waiting for lower fuel prices to justify the

purchase of a larger vehicle; historical tracking doesn't seem to matter."



DesRosiers used the findings, which looked at subcompact and compact cars, as

well as compact truck sales, to attack the federal government's ecoAuto feebate

program, saying that the numbers made a "mockery" of the government's plan that

gives consumers $1,000-2,000 rebates to buy the most fuel-efficient vehicles,

while penalizing buyers of the least-efficient vehicles with a new tax of up to

$4,000.



"Instead of the ill-conceived federal feebate debacle, all Ottawa had to do was

increase the price of fuel," said DesRosiers.



"Everyone would have been treated fairly, it would immediately result in more

entry-level vehicle purchases, and all 19 million vehicle owners might drive

less."



DesRosiers has been one of the most vociferous critics of the feebate plan,

although usually conservative Honda Canada has been taking out ads blasting the

program while offering rebates on its Fit and some gas Honda Civic models to

match it.



"I guess effective policies to address the climate change agenda are not part of

any federal politician's policy portfolio," wrote DesRosiers.



Watch that warranty



on a longer lease



Despite a general waning in the popularity of leasing throughout North America,

it still accounted for 44 per cent of all retail new-car deals in Canada in the

first five months of 2007, according to J.D. Power's dealer newsletter, the

Power Information Network.



The newsletter also finds that the average lease term is 46 months, an

eye-opening figure, since many basic warranties only cover up to three years of

ownership. And the last thing long-term car "renters" need is to pay for repairs

themselves on a vehicle that is due to be given back to the dealer in the near

future.



Many buyers realize this, as shown by the long average lease length for Korean

brands Kia and Hyundai of 62 months, both of which offer five-year/100,000-km

powertrain warranties.



At Mitsubishi - with the longest warranty in Canada, five years of basic

coverage and a 10-year/160,000-km powertrain warranty - the most popular lease

term is 84-89.9 months, or between seven and seven and a half years.



Sample satellite radio



on your cellphone



As goes one (XM), the other must as well - Sirius Canada announced last week

that a sampling of its satellite radio channels are now available on Bell

Mobility multimedia phones.



The move follows a similar deal between XM and Rogers that allows 25 satellite

stations to be available on Rogers cellphones, while Telus has a deal with XM

for 20 stations on its phones.



The Bell Mobility deal with Sirius provides 20 satellite channels to choose

from, for a cost of $8 a month on multimedia-capable phones, which include the

popular LG Chocolate, LG Fusic, Samsung m610 and Samsung a900.



Interestingly, most of these phones have an auxiliary audio-out cord, which may

be able to connect with the iPod adapters now coming in many new cars .



If this is the case, it would be a low-cost way to get satellite radio in your

car, as both XM and Sirius run for $14.99 a month.



Of course, with those pricier services, you get the full 100-plus channel

lineups, and the ability to use your car's stereo controls instead of fidgeting

with a separate unit/cellphone.



Audi RS4 run



ends next year



Fresh off Audi's seventh win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, news has come down that

the 2008 model year will be the last for the Audi RS4 super sports sedan.



Despite speculation that production of the 400-hp powerhouse had already

stopped, that is not the case, but there will be no 2009 RS4, Patrick Hespen,

Audi's media relations and motorsport specialist, told Winding Road magazine.



Spy shots of the RS6 in final testing are circulating online, and traditionally,

the ultimate "RS" performance moniker is only given to one Audi vehicle at a

time. Hespen did not confirm the RS6 would replace the RS4, but did say that

this policy of one RS at a time might change down the road.



Sales of the $100,000 RS4 quickly outpaced those of the similarly powerful and

pricey S6 when it was introduced last year, so chances are Audi dealers are well

into their 2008 allotments now.



Production may not end until next year, but given the low number of these

vehicles allocated to this country, its availability in Canada may be ending

soon.



Sexy billboards



a safety hazard?



An Athens traffic official estimated that 10 per cent of all crashes in the city

are caused by sexy but distracting advertisements, the British Guardian

newspaper reports.



The statement was prompted by a civil suit of wrongful death, brought by a

lawyer in Athens after his son died in a traffic accident, claiming that too

many drivers are taking their eyes off the road to ogle models advertising

cigarettes, perfume and cellphones.



Athanasios Tsokos is suing the city, claiming city officials of the Greek

capital are responsible for ensuring the safety of its citizens and should be

removing illegally placed ads.



Earlier this year, a Greek court upheld a claim from Tsokos that the government

is responsible for keeping the nation's roads clear of illegal billboards,

resulting in local councils being ordered to enforce the law by having them

removed. Athens is estimated to have 15,000 illegal billboards - many badly

erected and liable to fall down or blow away.
