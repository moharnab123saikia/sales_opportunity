Quadrooter flaw warns security company Check Point software technologies.Found
in devices running Qualcomm processors, QuadRooter includes four
vulnerabilities, any of which can be used by hackers to take control of an
smartphone. "If exploited, QuadRooter vulnerabilities can give attackers
complete control of devices and unrestricted access to sensitive personal and
enterprise data on them. Access could also provide an attacker with capabilities
such as keylogging, GPS tracking, and recording video and audio," says Check
Point in a blog post.Hackers can trigger any of these four vulnerabilities using
a malicious app.

"Such an app would require no special permissions to take advantage of these
vulnerabilities, alleviating any suspicion users may have when installing," adds
the post.The blog notes that QuadRooter affects smartphone drivers which control
communication between the various chipset components. Since the vulnerable
drivers are pre-installed on devices at manufacturing level, it can only be
fixed if the OEMs or carriers issue a software patch.Check Point recommends
users to download and install the latest Android updates as soon as they become
available, avoid side-loading apk files, read app permission requests carefully
while installing apps and more.Some of the latest smartphones that are
vulnerable to the QuadRooter are Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge , OnePlus 3,
Google Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, LG G4, LG G5 , LG V10, OnePlus One, OnePlus
2, OnePlus 3 and more.Earlier this year (in May), it was found that several
million Android smartphones running on Qualcomm processors are exposed to a
glitch that can be exploited by hackers to gain access to the device.
