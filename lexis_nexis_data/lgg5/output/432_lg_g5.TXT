NEW DELHI: Beware, over 900 million Android devices are affected by 'high-risk'

Quadrooter flaw warns security company Check Point software technologies.Found

in devices running Qualcomm processors, QuadRooter includes four

vulnerabilities, any of which can be used by hackers to take control of an

smartphone. "If exploited, QuadRooter vulnerabilities can give attackers

complete control of devices and unrestricted access to sensitive personal and

enterprise data on them. Access could also provide an attacker with capabilities

such as keylogging, GPS tracking, and recording video and audio," says Check

Point in a blog post.Hackers can trigger any of these four vulnerabilities using

a malicious app.



"Such an app would require no special permissions to take advantage of these

vulnerabilities, alleviating any suspicion users may have when installing," adds

the post.The blog notes that QuadRooter affects smartphone drivers which control

communication between the various chipset components. Since the vulnerable

drivers are pre-installed on devices at manufacturing level, it can only be

fixed if the OEMs or carriers issue a software patch.Check Point recommends

users to download and install the latest Android updates as soon as they become

available, avoid side-loading apk files, read app permission requests carefully

while installing apps and more.Some of the latest smartphones that are

vulnerable to the QuadRooter are Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge , OnePlus 3,

Google Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, LG G4, LG G5 , LG V10, OnePlus One, OnePlus

2, OnePlus 3 and more.Earlier this year (in May), it was found that several

million Android smartphones running on Qualcomm processors are exposed to a

glitch that can be exploited by hackers to gain access to the device.
