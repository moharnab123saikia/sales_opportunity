LENGTH: 301 words





LG Electronics Inc. on Thursday released more teasers for its next flagship

smartphone set to be released later this month, although it refrained from

giving significant details about features or design.



The G5 smartphone will be introduced on Feb. 21, a day before the opening of the

Mobile World Congress (MWC) that runs in Barcelona, Spain, LG said. Last month,

the company sent out invitations to the showcase event with a poster that

portrayed a music box and the phrase "play begins."



The three kinds of invitations revealed on Thursday came with the phrase "come

meet new friends on the playground," each featuring balloon animals, toy robots,

and air dancers. Unlike the previous invitation, LG also mentioned the name G5

for the first time.



On the same day, LG's bigger rival Samsung Electronics Co. will also showcase

its presumed Galaxy S7 in Barcelona.



Industry watchers expect Samsung will focus on improving features and

maintaining the design of the previous phones.



LG is rumored to be adopting a metal body for the G5 to improve design, as the

predecessor G4's leather case did not appeal strongly to users.



The G5 is expected to play a decisive role in LG's mobile business, industry

watchers added.



The company has been suffering from lackluster earnings at home and abroad as

Samsung Electronics weighed down on its domestic sales while Chinese firms also

ate into LG's market share in the global market.



The firm's mobile business posted an operating loss of 43.8 billion won (US$36.4

million) in the fourth quarter of last year, continuing to post weak returns

amid heightened competition. The segment posted an operating loss of 77.6

billion won in the third quarter of 2015.



LG sold 59.7 million units of smartphones last year, rising slightly from the

59.1 million units posted in 2014. (Yonhap)
