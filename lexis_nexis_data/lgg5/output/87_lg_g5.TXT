

LG Electronics Inc. on Thursday released more teasers for its next flagship
smartphone set to be released later this month, although it refrained from
giving significant details about features or design.

The G5 smartphone will be introduced on Feb. 21, a day before the opening of the
Mobile World Congress (MWC) that runs in Barcelona, Spain, LG said. Last month,
the company sent out invitations to the showcase event with a poster that
portrayed a music box and the phrase "play begins."

The three kinds of invitations revealed on Thursday came with the phrase "come
meet new friends on the playground," each featuring balloon animals, toy robots,
and air dancers. Unlike the previous invitation, LG also mentioned the name G5
for the first time.

On the same day, LG's bigger rival Samsung Electronics Co. will also showcase
its presumed Galaxy S7 in Barcelona.

Industry watchers expect Samsung will focus on improving features and
maintaining the design of the previous phones.

LG is rumored to be adopting a metal body for the G5 to improve design, as the
predecessor G4's leather case did not appeal strongly to users.

The G5 is expected to play a decisive role in LG's mobile business, industry
watchers added.

The company has been suffering from lackluster earnings at home and abroad as
Samsung Electronics weighed down on its domestic sales while Chinese firms also
ate into LG's market share in the global market.

The firm's mobile business posted an operating loss of 43.8 billion won (US$36.4
million) in the fourth quarter of last year, continuing to post weak returns
amid heightened competition. The segment posted an operating loss of 77.6
billion won in the third quarter of 2015.

LG sold 59.7 million units of smartphones last year, rising slightly from the
59.1 million units posted in 2014. (Yonhap)
