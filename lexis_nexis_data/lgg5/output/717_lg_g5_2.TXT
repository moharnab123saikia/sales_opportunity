Men spend more than women at Christmas

ANEW report finds that when it comes to buying Christmas presents for a partner,

men are the more generous sex. The average man shells out almost £115, while a

woman will spend £75.



The gender divide is also clear when buying for parents. The average person

spends almost £50 on a gift for their mother but less than £40 on their father.



Simon Fowler, customer service director of John Lewis, said: "Women have been

getting a better deal out of Christmas for years. It may be partly that they

tend to buy presents for more people, so their average spend on each is less.



"Women also love to be spoilt at Christmas and men like to spoil them.



And there are so many femaleorientated gifts.



"Men are traditionally more difficult to buy for, so it may be that partners go

for the practical option of jumper, socks, cufflinks and so on, focusing on

specific items that they actually need."



The report, carried out by NOP and commissioned by John Lewis, also found that:

. Only 16 per cent of Britons start their Christmas shopping before October,

with the majority waiting until December.



. More than half of the 1,000 people questioned write lists of the gifts they

plan to buy before hitting the high street, and just under half work out budgets

in advance.



. More than half spend two hours or less on a Christmas shopping trip, and just

under half buy all their presents in no more than four trips.



"Retailers say Christmas is starting later and later," said Mr Fowler.



"This survey suggests shoppers are only visiting stores once they have come up

with a cunning plan."



The survey also found that a quarter of people plan to use annual leave to do

their shopping, and that almost a third will buy the boss a gift, with an

average spend of £17.



But perhaps the secret to successful Christmas shopping lies in another

phenomenon identified in the research: "me-gifting".



More than a third of shoppers will buy a gift for themselves, spending an

average of £42.
