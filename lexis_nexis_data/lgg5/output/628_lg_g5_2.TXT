A teaser for a new HTC device popped up recently, which is no doubt an

announcement for the HTC One M10.



All the teaser says is "Power of 10" against a design of the edge of the phone.

From this design, we get our biggest clue is that it will have sharper edges

than the HTC One M9, which had rounded edges. Earlier codenamed "Perfume," which

could very well end up to be the HTC One M10.



The rumored specs for the phone include a Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of

RAM. It is said to come out of the box running Android Marshmallow. Other specs

are yet to be revealed. Although we have a rough idea of what's inside the

phone, the teaser itself was the first clue to how the phone looks.



The email with the teaser says to stay tuned for more details, like a launch

date, time and place, hopefully before long. However, the latest reports suggest

that HTC might hold an event on April 11 in London to unveil its flagship. Its

competitors, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 both have been announced at MWC2016

earlier this week. Although it was a smart move from HTC to get away from all

the buzz at MWC so that it can get attention for itself, but the question

arises, will the wait be worth it?
