Android 7.0 comes to LG G5 today



LENGTH: 179  words





But just in South Korea for now



LG G5 users can rejoice! You are also getting Android 7.0 Nougat.



Starting today, LG G5 users in South Korea will be getting the update to Android

7.0 Nougat. Since South Korea is home turf for LG, it is no surprise that they

get it first, which will soon be followed by an international release.

Curiously, LG didnt bother to label the UK or Europe in general in today's press

release, opting to use the word "other markets." That's on top of not bothering

to launch the LG V20 in the UK



The LG G5 might also get some performance upgrades with the Android 7.0 Nougat

OS. This includes a more streamlined UI for speed and convenience. Searches, for

example, happen across user-install apps, not just pre-installed ones. Users

will also get the new multi window experience to switch between apps, which can

also run side by side. Users will also get nested notifications as well.



As mentioned, the update is only for South Korea as of now, but we can expect an

OTA update internationally soon.
