LG's Marshmallow-based UX 5.0 was officially released with the LG G5 flagship

smartphone in April this year.



The G5 placed a lot of emphasis on being a modular smartphone, and being part of

an ecosystem of linked devices.



Hence, UX 5.0 comes with the LG Friends Manager, which can be used to connect

the phone to other LG devices like the LG 360 Cam and the LG 360 VR.



The Friends Manager can automatically detect these other devices, connect to

them and find the appropriate software needed for the devices to work.



UX 5.0 also focuses heavily on the photo-taking experience, and LG has beefed up

the camera software with a host of features.



When using the front camera, Auto Shot detects whether a user is posing for a

picture, and automatically triggers the shutter, while Multi-View takes pictures

with the front, rear and wide-angle cameras all at once.



There is an Always Onscreen, which displays information without having to wake

up the phone.



UX 5.0 also comes with New Home, an integrated home screen where all the apps

are located, much like Apple's iOS.



And after the complaints during the beta about the lack of an apps drawer, the

final version of UX 5.0 has an option in the Settings menu to reinstate the app

drawer.
