A bigger SPLASH The adrenaline-fuelled America's Cup sailing race is already

under way. In honour of its 35th birthday, sponsor Louis Vuitton has created a

capsule collection that sees nautical stripes splashed over bags and neoprene

jackets (left). Bremont, official timekeepers of the event, has created a range

of chronograph Regatta timepieces - set to make waves.



Regatta OTUSA watch, £4,995 (www.bremont.com) GOOD CALL Thanks to its

interchangeable design, the LG G5 can become an eight megapixel digital camera,

hi-fi player or virtual reality headset. Plus, its 5.2in LCD screen and

contoured aluminium body means it's arguably just a tiny bit better than the

LG G5 phone, £550 (www.lg.com) zip it Take note of the blouson jacket, making a

return this summer. The zip-front, shirt-collared jacket is a classic - and

helps keep off the chill on summer evenings. Wear yours just like the macho film

heroes did back in the day, with a white T-shirt and slim-cut jeans to offset

its simple, boxy shape.
