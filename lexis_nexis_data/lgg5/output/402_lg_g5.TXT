LENGTH: 154 words





[THE INVESTOR] LG Electronics on Oct. 27 reported its third-quarter operating

profit of 283.2 billion won (US$250.90 million), down 3.7 percent from a year

ago.



Revenue also fell 5.7 percent on year to 13.2 trillion won.



Despite strong sales of its TVs and home appliances, the mobile business

division suffered extended losses of 466.4 billion won after a series of

failures in its flagship G series phones in recent years, including the latest

G5.



"Phone sales declined almost 24 percent due to sluggish premium models and their

slowing product prices," the company said. Smartphone shipments tumbled 41

percent on its home turf alone.



"The ongoing restructuring at the mobile business division will be finalized

soon to improve its financial and operational structures."



The company said it would make all-out efforts for marketing activities of the

latest bigger-screen V20 smartphone in the rest of the year.
