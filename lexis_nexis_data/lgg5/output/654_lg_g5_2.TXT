SMARTPHONE'S DAY USE FROM 30 MINS CHARGE;

A SMARTPHONE which gives a day's use from a 30-minute charge goes on sale next

month.



HTC's M10 is the first in the UK to use Quick Charge 3.0 technology to suck up

power quickly.



Users can get the battery half full - enough for a day - in half an hour. A full

charge for two days of use will take around 80 minutes.



Stuart Miles, of tech website Pocket-Lint, said: "Battery life is really

important for users but improvements in efficiency are slower than most would

like. So firms are saying if you can't make a battery last longer, let's make it

charge quicker."



They added: "Most of us have access to a power socket at some point in the day

and if it only takes half an hour for a day's charge, that is a really appealing

selling point." The Â£569.99 M10 has a giant battery and clever "power

management" that can shut off apps if they are draining its charge.



The handset is the latest flagship refresh from the big phone firms as they look

to catch Apple's iPhone.



Samsung's S7, with a curved screen, went on sale in mid-March, while LG's G5 hit

shops on Friday. Huawei unveiled its P9 last week.
