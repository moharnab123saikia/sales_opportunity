month.

HTC's M10 is the first in the UK to use Quick Charge 3.0 technology to suck up
power quickly.

Users can get the battery half full - enough for a day - in half an hour. A full
charge for two days of use will take around 80 minutes.

Stuart Miles, of tech website Pocket-Lint, said: "Battery life is really
important for users but improvements in efficiency are slower than most would
like. So firms are saying if you can't make a battery last longer, let's make it
charge quicker."

They added: "Most of us have access to a power socket at some point in the day
and if it only takes half an hour for a day's charge, that is a really appealing
selling point." The Â£569.99 M10 has a giant battery and clever "power
management" that can shut off apps if they are draining its charge.

The handset is the latest flagship refresh from the big phone firms as they look
to catch Apple's iPhone.

Samsung's S7, with a curved screen, went on sale in mid-March, while LG's G5 hit
shops on Friday. Huawei unveiled its P9 last week.
