The LG Cam Plus is a module that is meant to turn a smartphone into a

traditional point- and-shoot digital camera. It adds on a camera grip and zoom

wheel, as well as physical shutter, launch and record buttons.



The module itself is quite basic, with a flat, grey textured plastic handgrip

that covers about a third of the phone.



It is meant to be used with the phone in landscape mode, with the shutter and

record buttons on the top, the zoom wheel at the corner and the launch button on

the right.



While the additional grip does make the phone a little easier to handle with one

hand, it is not particularly ergonomic as it is completely flat, and reaching

the launch button during one-handed usage is a little tricky.



All the buttons are responsive, and the launch button works even when the phone

is locked.



However, I found that because of the low profile of the buttons and the very

smooth scrolling on the zoom wheel, there was very little tactile feedback

overall, and often I had to wait for an on-screen response to know if I had

pressed a button or not.



Its 1,200mAh battery also needs to be charged separately, and cannot draw power

from the G5 if it is flat.
