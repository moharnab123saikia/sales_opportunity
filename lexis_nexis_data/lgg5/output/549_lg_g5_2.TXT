With the MWC 2016 starting today in full swing, many phones are getting its

reveals. While major players like the Samsung S7 and LG G5 are getting most of

the limelight, leaks from the HTC camps are making its way into the news. Images

of the HTC A16, which is similar to the M10 in power, but is set to look to the

stars. Literally.



Courtesy of Evan Blass, also known as @evleaks, the HTC A16 is one of the new

lineups from HTC. From a design perspective, it looks similar to the HTC Desire

626 product line, which brings the question that it could be a rebranding of the

Desire lineup, or might be called the HTC Desire A16. The rear camera looks

quite large which suggests that it may be of high resolution, with a single LED

flash, and a smaller front camera. From the images we can see that BoomSound

speakers seem to be in the front, but it can be at the bottom grill as well,

which look oddly reminiscent of the Sony Walkman logo.

The HTC bar is located along the bottom part of the display bezel, which has

been hated by critics since the original HTC One M7, but it looks like HTC is

not done with it yet. Another clue that it may be one of the Desire series, is

the color schemes, as there are a variety of color themes and patterns.



In terms of specs, nothing is confirmed as of now, but it might come with either

a Snapdragon or MediaTek SoC on board and HTC Sense, while the phone will be

made of polycarbonate plastic. It is still not confirmed if the HTC A16 will be

revealed at MWC or if it will have a later date.
