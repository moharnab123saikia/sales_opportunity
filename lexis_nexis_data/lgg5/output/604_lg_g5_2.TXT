phones.


900 million Android smartphones could be at potential risk after the discovery
of four new Android vulnerabilities by security firm Check Point.

Potentially giving attackers complete control of devices and access to sensitive
data stored on them, the group of vulnerabilities have been named QuadRooter by
Check Point researchers.

The vulnerabilities are in the software drivers Qualcomm ships with its chipsets
- a huge concern as Qualcomm supplies 80% of chipsets found in the Android
ecosystem.

If a hacker exploits any of the four vulnerabilities then they could be able to
trigger privilege escalations and gain root access to a device. This would
enable the hackers to change or remove system-level files, delete or add apps,
and access the phone's screen, camera or microphone.

Check Point has issued a warning to those with the following devices: Samsung
Galaxy S7 & S7 Edge, Sony Xperia Z Ultra, Google Nexus 5X, 6 & 6P, HTC One M9 &
HTC 10, LG G4, G5 & V10, OnePlus One, 2 & 3, BlackBerry Priv, and Blackphone 1 &
2.

Due to the fact that the vulnerable drivers are pre-installed on devices, the
vulnerabilities can only be fixed by installing a patch from the distributor or
carrier. However, patches and fixed driver packs can only be issued by Qualcomm.
Qualcomm became aware of the QuadRooter after being notified by Check Point in
April 2016, with the manufacturer since having issued patches to OEMs.

Check Point has also released a free QuadRooter scanner app for those who may be
affected, with the app available from Google Play.

The discovery of QuadRooter follows Check Point's earlier discovery of the
Hummingbad malware, which was found to have infected over 85 million Android
devices.
