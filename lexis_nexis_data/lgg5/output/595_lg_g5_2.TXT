OS was found as a part of a developer code on GitHub and Google's own code
repository website. The OS is said to be focussed on IoT (Internet of Things)
and does not run on Linux unlike Android and Chrome OS.First spotted by Android
Police, the OS is based on Magenta, which is a "medium-sized microkernel" that
itself is based on a project called as LittleKernel. The platform is said to be
designed for embedded systems for instance a PC that doesn't use the regular OS,
GPS devices or car dashboards.On further finding, the GitHub website titled
"Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System)" adds that the Google Fuchsia
OS is for "modern phones and modern personal computers" that are based on "fast
processors" and use "trivial amounts of RAM."As per multiple reports, the Google
Fuchsia OS might become the ultimate OS as it may unify Chrome OS, Android and
the IoT platform, Brillo.

This means it would take just one OS to run from desktops to smartphones,
tablets, and everything else.The Fuchsia OS's kernel includes OS features like
user modes and a capability-based security model. Although Google is yet to give
details on the project and on which device will we see it first, a Google
engineer named Travis Geiselbrecht has said it would arrive on Raspberry Pi 3
soon, reports Y Combinator news website.Talking about OSes, Google has started
rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat previews to Sony Xperia X Performance and LG G5
smartphones.
