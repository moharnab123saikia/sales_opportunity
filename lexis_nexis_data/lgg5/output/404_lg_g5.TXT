NEW DELHI: LG recently confirmed that it would be launching its V20 smartphone

soon , which would reportedly be its first smartphone running Android 7.0 Nougat

out of the box. And although the South Korean tech giant hasn't yet mentioned

anything else about the device, a leak has popped-up showing the purported

specifications of the upcoming smartphone.The leaked image, coming from a Korean

website Sedaily (via Phone Arena), suggests that the LG V20 will feature a

5.5-inch Full HD resolution display of 1080x1920 pixel resolution. This is quite

surprising as the current LG V10 has a larger 5.7-inch display with better

1440x2560 pixel resolution.The V20 will be powered by a quad-core Qualcomm

Snapdragon 820 processor clubbed with Adreno 530 GPU and 3GB/4GB RAM.



It is supposed to come with 32GB /64GB of in-built storage, along with support

for microSD cards of up to 256GB in size.Interestingly, the leak reveals nothing

about the V20 having a secondary screen as in the case of the V10. There is also

no mention of the device coming with a dual camera setup. The handset will

likely include a 20MP rear camera and an 8MP front-facing shooter. A USB Type-C

port and a 4,000mAh battery are also expected.According to LG, the focus of the

V20 will be delivering a better multimedia experience. The device will launch in

September.LG recently announced its financial results for Q2 2016. The company

shipped a total of 13.9 million smartphones in the second quarter, an increase

of 3% from the previous quarter. The mobile division also registered revenues of

$2.86 billion, a 12% increase over the first quarter, while declining over the

same period the year before. LG reported an operating loss of $132.10 million,

blaming "reflected increased marketing expenditures and somewhat slow initial

sales of G5 smartphone."
