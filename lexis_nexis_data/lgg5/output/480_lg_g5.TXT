Security flaws that could give hackers complete access to a smartphone have been

found in the microchips of millions of Android devices, researchers claim.



The computer security firm Check Point told a hacking convention in the US that

it had found a bug - which it calls QuadRooter - that could affect up to 900

million Android phones, including some made by BlackBerry, Google and LG among

others, which is caused by vulnerabilities in the processor chips used in those

phones by the US firm Qualcomm.



There is no evidence that the problem has been used by cyber criminals.

According to Check Point, if a "malicious app" installed on the affected phones

could exploit the vulnerabilities, it could "give attackers complete control of

devices and unrestricted access to sensitive personal and enterprise data on

them".



The alleged weakness, which is linked to the code that controls communication

between different parts running inside a phone, is believed already to be the

subject of a fix or "patch" being built by Qualcomm to remove the issue.



The chipmaker is yet to officially comment on the issue.



Check Point also suggested that the Android platform as a whole - which is open

to dozens of different manufacturers and software developers - was part of the

problem, with updates taking too long to pass through the system.



"This situation highlights the inherent risks in the Android security model,"

the firm said. "Critical security updates must pass through the entire supply

chain before they can be made available to end users."



The security firm has encouraged users to keep their phone's software up to date

in order to keep it secure, and said it had also created a free app called

QuadRooter Scanner, which can check whether a user's phone is at risk.



Michael Shaulov, head of mobility product management at Check Point, told the

BBC: "I'm pretty sure you will see these vulnerabilities being used in the next

three to four months.



"It's always a race as to who finds the bug first, whether it's the good guys or

the bad."



At risk? The models that could be vulnerable Among the models thought to be

affected are: Nexus 5X, Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P Motorola's New Moto X (left) HTC

One, HTC M9 and HTC 10 LG G4, LG G5, and LG V10 BlackBerry Priv Samsung Galaxy

S7 and Samsung S7 Edge (US models) Sony Xperia Z Ultra (right) Blackphone 1 and

Blackphone 2 OnePlus One, OnePlus 2 and OnePlus 3
