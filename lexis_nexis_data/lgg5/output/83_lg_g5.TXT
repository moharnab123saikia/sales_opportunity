We compare the Moto Z Force, LG G5 and the Le Max 2 to find out which is the

best Snapdragon 820 smartphone.



Lenovo-owned Motorola has launched the Moto Z and Moto Z Force, a pair of

modular smartphones at Tech World 2016 on Thursday (9th June 2016). What sets

these smartphones apart from its competition are the changeable magnetic snap-on

back panels which the company calls MotoMods. Released with the latest

Snapdragon 820 chipset from Qualcomm, the smartphone's closest competitors are

the modular LG G5 and the recently launched Le Max 2. Let's take a closer look

to see how they stack up against each other.



Display



All three smartphones come with a QHD (1440 x 2560 pixels) display. At 5.7

inches, the Le Max 2 has the biggest display of the three smartphones. However,

the display of the LG G5 and the Moto Z Force come with nifty features. The

5.3-inch LG G5 sports always-on display while the 5.5-inch Moto Z Force comes

with a shatterproof screen.



Winner: Depends on what your preference is. Do you want a larger display? Or

would you rather have an Always-on display or a shatterproof screen?



The Guts (RAM, Storage, and Chipset)



While all three smartphones come with the same Snapdragon 820 chipset and offer

expandable storage up to 256GB, there are minor differences between other

components. At the highest setting, Le Max 2 comes equipped with the more

capable 6GB RAM and 64GB of inbuilt storage while the G5 comes with 4GB RAM and

32GB of internal storage and the Moto Z Force comes with 4GB RAM and 64GB of

inbuilt storage.



Winner: Le Max 2



Camera



Even though at three smartphones have a rear camera that can capture video in

2160p at 30fps and a front camera that can capture video in 1080p at 30fps, the

Le Max 2 has the most capable front and rear cameras -- 21-megapixel rear camera

and 8-megapixel front camera. In comparison, the LG G5 has a 16MP rear camera

8MP front camera while the Moto Z Force has a 21MP rear camera and 5MP front

facing camera.



Winner: On paper the Le Max 2 seems to be the best.



Price



The Le Max 2 will set you back Rs. 22,999 and the LG G5 retails for Rs 52,990.

Motorola hasn't announced the price of the Moto Z Force as yet though it is

expected that the smartphone will in the premium price bracket.



Winner: Based on price, the Le Max 2 gives you the most bang for your buck.
