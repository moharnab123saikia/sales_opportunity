Desktop superheroes reveal their special powers

Desktops now come in all sizes and fit into every corner of the home. Stewart

Mitchell picks 10 silicon saviours ready to come to your rescue



Desktop computers are the new superheroes of our homes. No longer a

one-size-fits-all beige box, they have become specialised allies, with distinct

powers, poised to serve all your digital needs. How strange it seems that Bill

Gates's famously bold prediction -that one day, every home would have a computer

-is now, if anything, a huge understatement. Many homes already boast multiple

machines, and this year alone, predicts the industry analyst Gartner, sales in

the UK will top 9m units. That's a lot of silicon love.



Although laptops exude considerable allure, as Doors discussed last week, there

are compelling reasons to plump for a full-sized machine, or three. Not least of

which is the desire to limit squabbles as computers become an integral part of

all our lives. The biggest single advantage is cost: a £1,000 desktop is a far

more powerful beast than a comparably priced notebook. It is also more

comfortable to use for long periods, thanks to a better keyboard, a proper mouse

(or trackball), and a screen that can be positioned anywhere. If mobility and

miniaturisation are not vital, a desktop strides purposefully into the

limelight.



In the old days, power was everything. A Hulk-strength processor would have

machines flying out of the shops. With even a modest new desktop machine now

capable of handling most computing tasks -rampant gaming aside -those days are

gone. Instead, the 21st-century desktop has evolved into many shapes and sizes.



Whether you're an early adopter hankering for a slinky-as-Catwoman, media

friendly machine to purr quietly as it records Lost in the living room; an

ardent gamer itching for a Superman-style powerhouse; or a family hunting for

the versatility of Batman's utility belt, at a super-duper price, there's a hero

ready to fly to your side.



As our new purchases take pride of place, their usurped predecessors are pushed

into other roles. Father-of-two Michael Andrews, from Hertfordshire, employs his

expensive new Evesham computer for "editing videos to embarrass the children",

while Sam, 11, and Sean, 7, now benefit from the old family workhorse by

"playing on CBeebies" and "making projects look better". In fact, the technology

research firm Mintel estimates that a quarter of children aged between 11 and 14

have a computer sitting in their bedroom -an increasingly key consideration as

basic computing skills swell in importance. There is also much to be said for

cheap-as-chips packages that cannot distract anyone with 3-D gaming.



As the computer becomes the place where we store our music collection, tinker

with photos or interact with friends, we face a dilemma: where to put it? If it

is somewhere public, a stylish Apple iMac or a diminutive Shuttle could appeal.

If tucked away, then a machine containing a huge hard drive that can act as a

multimedia cupboard, dishing out digital delights wirelessly around the home,

looms into view.



There is a lot of industry noise about Media Center computers -essentially

Windows XP with a television tuner and remote control. The high-street retailer

PC World claims that these account for 50% of the desktops it now sells. Despite

the hype, in reality, most entertainment-orientated PCs are not landing in the

living room, where consumer electronics offer many of the same features more

cheaply, but in the "den". No matter where a desktop resides, a space-saving,

flat LCD screen is a big attraction, but not all have equal powers; and poor

viewing angles often disappoint. This is a caveat with many bargain bundles.

Don't be seduced by a pile of shoddy accessories -time spent reading reviews is

well invested.



That said, a surplus of chips and ever fiercer competition between the two

processor-makers, Intel and AMD, is crashing prices, so bargains abound. If you

are simply going to surf the web or write the odd letter, £500 will suffice, but

keen video editors or gamers will need to spend at least twice that. Assess your

needs and stick to a budget: don't buy an Aston Martin when all you need is a

Ford Focus. Nobody would choose a car purely on brake horsepower; similarly, a

computer performs only as well as its weakest link. Less glamorous components,

such as a Sata hard drive, make a big difference, though do keep an eye out for

dual-processor chips, which are better at multitasking.



The waters are slightly muddied by next autumn's scheduled launch of Vista,

Microsoft's new version of Windows. Doors will look at Vista on another

occasion, but what you need to be aware of now is that in order to run it, any

computer requires a separate graphics card with 128MB of Ram. This can always be

added later, though -another key advantage of desktops over a luscious-looking

laptop.



To help you find your own superhero, Doors has examined 10 of the most dashing

desktops. The majority are supplied directly by the manufacturers, which now

stock a lot of the best kit. However, don't let this deter you from the high

street for budget packages or if you're in a hurry to take home your new hero to

help save the day.



VALUE SYSTEMS



EARLY-LEARNING CENTRE



499 LG PC. £499 from www.directfrom.co.uk ****



Ideal as a first computer for the children's bedroom, this budget LG is great

value for money, although the integrated graphics won't play the latest games

-no distractions there, then -and the case has all the allure of a 1970s tower

block.



The 160GB hard drive offers plenty of storage for homework projects, as well as

a Devon-sized dollop of digital media, and a dual-layer DVD writer is an

impressive bonus. The LG Flatron display is sharp and vibrant, but the budget

aspect of this bundle is highlighted by an old-fashioned mouse and rattly

keyboard. There is, thankfully, plenty of scope for improving the specification

of this machine later, once the children embarrass you with their technical

wizardry. Computer Buyer



SPARE-ROOM SURFER



Zoostorm 2-3301. £504 from www.pcnextday.co.uk ****



Perfect as a second surfing station for the spare room, the Zoostorm is amply

powered for most computing applications, including video editing. At a pinch, it

could be pushed into service as a basic gaming machine, thanks to a dedicated

graphics card. The 160GB hard drive is ably supported by a dual-layer DVD

writer, and the bundled wireless mouse and keyboard free the desktop of clutter,

although the built-in speakers need supplementing. Six USB2 ports provide plenty

of connections for extra gadgets such as MP3 players or a video camera. The

Zoostorm is a surprisingly potent animal for the price, but limited upgrade

options will restrict its evolution. Computer Buyer



MEAN MACHINES



DIGITAL HOARDER



Evesham Teramedia. £3,000 from www.evesham.com ****



Storage is a bit like Fairy Liquid: dull as dishwater to think about, until you

run out. In the digital age, you simply cannot have too many gigabytes, and this

Media Center offers a positively monstrous 1.5 terabytes -meaning 1,450GB.



This is about 360 times the capacity of an iPod Nano, or 300 full-quality DVD

movies, all accessible at the flick of a remote control. Although the

Teramedia's twin digital Freeview tuners are ideal for recording one programme

while watching another, and the 20.1in screen is sharp (if not wide), the

Teramedia's chunky bulk will banish it immediately to the spare room. Even

gamers will squeal with excitement at the raw power on offer, but for this

money, you'd expect nothing less.



GAMES-ROOM DEMON



Mesh Matrix X-treme Pro. £1,807 from www.meshcomputers.com *****



Bargains abound, but playing the latest games, at maximum force, will seriously

test the mettle of any computer. The X-treme Pro packs a mighty dual-core

processor and totes the most powerful graphics card around, yet there is hardly

a sound, other than your own frag-fuelled whoops. The Athlon 64 X2 4800+

processor will crash through the most demanding of battles, and with 2GB of

PC3200 Ram sitting in its guts, you can run a gamut of programs simultaneously.

This machine is housed in a designer Coolermaster case, the vibrant TFT monitor

shows off fluid games with aplomb, and, as you'd expect, there is mountains of

memory. Throw in a three-year on-site warranty and it is a terrifying prospect

for your credit card.



SILICON STYLE



ALL-IN-ONE STUNNER



Apple 17in G5 iMac. £900 from www.store.apple.co.uk *****



The foxy iMac has always been a living-room-friendly creature, but the latest

incarnation now houses the entire computer inside the monitor. Cunning indeed.



Curiously, recent hardware tweaks have downgraded the G5 processor slightly, but

improvements to the Ram mean the new version will edit videos of the children's

birthday parties more quickly than before. There are faster machines including

Apples -around, but the iMac is no slouch, though it's wise to upgrade the

skimpy 512MB of Ram. Also new is Apple's media-player software, Front Row, with

a streamlined remote control featuring a mere six buttons. There is also a posh

built-in webcam for instant video conferencing. The iMac still lacks upgrade

potential -and the manoeuvrability of its Anglepoise-style antecedent -but, as

ever, simplicity and style are the watchwords. Throw in virus and spyware

resistance, as well as a lush widescreen, and it is a sexy beast. Stewart

Mitchell



SMALL AND BEAUTIFUL



Shuttle G5MCE. £1,029 without monitor, from www.theglowlounge.com ****



Shoebox-sized Shuttles are as popular as popcorn among image-conscious computing

connoisseurs, either unobtrusively nestled in a smallish study, or as a discreet

jukebox for the living room. They are intended for self-building, which means

you choose your components, then waste a weekend faffing. To save your hairline,

various companies will do all the work, but you still need a monitor, keyboard

and speakers, so factor in at least £300 more. This specific model, which you

can win in our competition (right), is based on the new SD11G5 chassis. It has

plenty of pose factor and is whisper-quiet. With 1GB of Ram and a 1.86GHz

Pentium M processor, it is modestly powered, but less heat means no noisy fans

to distract from dinner-party ambience. A genuine head-turner -even the

front-mounted USB, FireWire and headphone sockets are hidden behind the silver

panel. Simply gorgeous.



FAMILY-FRIENDLY



ARGUMENT SOLVER



Evesham e-box AX64. £1,013 from www.evesham.com *****



The e-box is a wallet-friendly combination of entertainment hub and homework

helper -and with a punchy new AMD processor, it's ready for Windows Vista. While

not explicitly a living-room computer, the AX64 comes with Windows Media Center

Edition -though not a Freeview television tuner, which would be a sensible

addition. The mediocre graphics card won't display the latest games on the

pin-sharp 19in TFT monitor, but Evesham offers an upgrade to the competent

GeForce 6600 GT for £50. Either way, there is plenty of horsepower, and a

dual-core processor means antivirus software won't get in the way as you edit

videos of that skiing holiday. Having a DVD burner and player enables copying

directly from one disc to another, and 200GB of storage is ample. The

easy-on-the-limbs Microsoft wireless keyboard and optical-tilt mouse combo, plus

2.1 stereo speakers, complete a fine family package.



COTTAGE INDUSTRIALIST



Dell OptiPlex GX620 USFF. £680, plus £364 for 19in UltraSharp monitor, from

www.euro.dell.com *****



It may be designed with business folk in mind, but this weeny Dell adds a

sprinkle of chic to any home office and, intriguingly, comes in a variety of

case sizes. An exemplary three-year, on-site, next-business-day warranty brings

peace of mind for anyone relying on "up time" for their livelihood, and modest,

functional hardware means the children won't be tempted to invade your workspace

to play 3-D games. This well designed machine has microphone and headphone jacks

at the front -handily placed for internet phone calls -but only two USB2 ports

for peripherals such as digital cameras or MP3 players. The eye-soothing 19in

UltraSharp 1905FP monitor ensures plenty of real estate for the most taxing of

spreadsheets -and provides another four USB ports. Good work.



THE ENTERTAINERS



BOX OF TRICKS



Hi-Grade DMSII 3400 Dual. £1,173 from www.higrade.com ****



This Media Center computer is trying to sneak into your living room by dressing

up like a hi-fi separate. Well, kind of. Stack it next to your stereo, stab the

remote just once, and it will record The West Wing and play your Jamiroquai

albums. The DMSII doesn't come with a screen, so you will need a television with

a DVI input.



Twin television tuners and a 250GB hard drive mean you can watch one channel

while recording another, though, annoyingly, only one of the tuners is digital.

The Hi-Grade totes a DVD burner, has plenty of computing power -even for gaming

-and it's so quiet it won't disturb even the weepiest tear-jerker. The trouble

is, as a Media Center computer, it's pipped by the Elonex Artisan. And despite

the DMSII's flexibility, there are better-quality DVD burners-cum-PVR combos for

far less loot.



WIDESCREEN WONDER



HP Media Center M7250 and F2105 monitor. £1,469 from www.johnlewis.com ****



With so many lesser-known direct manufacturers crowding the market, it's easy to

forget that established players such as HP offer splendid computers that come

backed by years of experience and rock-solid reliability -though this does mean

premium prices. This fast Media Center eschews some of the more cutting-edge

technology, but its 2.8GHz dual-core processor will still rattle through family

functions, ably assisted by a solid 1GB of fast Ram memory. The built-in

television tuner is ideal for capturing your favourite shows, but it's analogue,

not digital. The star of the show is the elegant and unusually large 21in

widescreen monitor, which is great for watching movies, and you can win both in

our competition (right). The trade-off is a relatively small 200GB hard drive

(for a media machine) and average graphics, but you can upgrade the graphics

card for gaming and add speakers, but at this price, you might expect the whole

caboodle. Stewart Mitchell



FIRST THING FIRST



* Consider your needs. For gamers, a 3GHz processor with 1GB of Ram and a

dedicated graphics card with 256MB of on-board memory are essential. For a

simple web browser, these specs can be halved.



* Treat 160GB as a minimum for hard-drive capacity. A DVD burner is now a must

for archiving or backup and a second optical drive is useful.



* Don't be oversold -an all-round family workhorse should cost no more than

£1,000.



* Check the quality of all peripherals -a deal may include a printer or

speakers, but these extras may be of poor quality. Look for consumer or

professional reviews on the web -www.reviewcentre.co.uk is useful.



* Save yourself the hassle of upgrading components later on by paying extra

during purchase: a Sata hard drive, for example, will make for far less thumb

twiddling while you wait for files to load.



* Ensure technical-assistance calls are not charged at a premium rate. About 8p

per minute is normal.



* Find out what software is installed: all suppliers include an operating

system, but many may scrimp on "productivity software", perhaps offering a cheap

word processor instead of the full Microsoft Office.



* Check the length of any warranty and what is included: "collect and return"

usually means that a manufacturer will pay shipping; "return to base" could mean

that is your responsibility; "on site" is best of the bunch. Extended warranties

are often poor value.



* Make your purchase by phone or over the internet. This entitles you to a

seven-day cooling-off period after delivery, when you can cancel the machine if

it is not what you want.



oPay by credit card, to protect you if goods are faulty or the supplier folds

before delivery.
