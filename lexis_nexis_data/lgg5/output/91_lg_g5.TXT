LG to offline promotions of G5



LENGTH: 224 words





LG Electronics, South Korea's No. 2 smartphone-maker, will likely skip preorders

to focus on offline promotions of its latest flagship G5 smartphone, industry

sources said Thursday.



The South Korean tech giant had held preorders for its predecessors -- the G3

and the G4.



LG Electronics has not yet announced the official release date of the G5,

although it is rumored to be between end-March and early April.



LG claims the 5.3-inch G5 smartphone, slightly smaller than the G4, is the world

market's first modular smartphone, which connects with various accessories,

including a camera controller that allows users to control the handset like a

digital single-lens reflex camera.



Local rival Samsung Electronics started preorders for its Galaxy S7 at home and

abroad earlier this month, with official sales slated to start Friday. Those

applying for early purchases are given a Gear VR, Samsung's virtual reality

device.



LG Electronics has been suffering from ailing performance of its smartphones,

giving the G5 a crucial role in the fate of its business.



The firm's mobile business posted an operating loss of 43.8 billion won ($36

million) in the fourth quarter of last year, and has continued to post weak

returns amid heightened competition. The segment posted an operating loss of

77.6 billion won in the third quarter of 2015.
