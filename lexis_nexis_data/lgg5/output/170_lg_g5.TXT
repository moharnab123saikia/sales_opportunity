durability. Though it supports the Quick Charge 3.0 similar to LG G5, but there

is the new USB Type-C port has been added. Because of Nougat, LG reintroduces

the multi window feature. The smartphone even beats Google's Pixel to being the

first Nougat device.



The LG V20 smartphone is powered by Snapdragon 820 processor with a DDR 4 RAM of

4 GB. The display screen is a huge 5.7-inch with 1440 p IPS. and a secondary

1040160 IPS (513ppi). The internal storage is expected to be 64 GB with the slot

for memory card. The rear camera is 16 megapixels with wide angle lens and f/1.8

aperture. On the front, the camera is able to click at 5 megapixels and aperture

of f/1.9. The device has a removable battery of 3200 mAh. The phone has great

dimensions of 159.7 x 78.1 x 7.6mm.



The regular features like HD audio recording, Hi-Fi video recording, and more as

intact. LG's partnership with Bang & Olufsen for audio parts is only available

for a few countries. LG's new smartphone will be availabe in three colours -
