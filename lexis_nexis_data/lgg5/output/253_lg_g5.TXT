as a camera and a speaker that can be slotted into this area with the battery at
the base of the phone.

The Korean firm s president Juno Cho described the new device as  an adventurous
theme park in your pocket .

Google is also working on a modular smartphone where users can add and remove
features, though it is thought to be far from completion. A small second battery
inside the phone keeps it running while any swap is made.

LG made the announcement at a press conference ahead of the Mobile World
Congress technology show that begins in Barcelona today.

The G5 will also have an  always-on  screen, though LG added this will only
highlight part of the screen and use less than 1% of the battery every hour.

The phone s rear camera also comes with a wide angle lens, which can be used to
take photos in a 135 degree range   wider than the viewing range of the human
eye.

Meanwhile, Huawei unveiled a hybrid laptop to compete with the iPad Pro and
Microsoft Surface.

The two-in-one device, which is called the MateBook, functions as a laptop, but
the screen can be detached to operate as a tablet, which will run Microsoft s
Windows 10.

It will come with a 12-inch full HD touch screen, with 8GB of memory for mobile
use.
