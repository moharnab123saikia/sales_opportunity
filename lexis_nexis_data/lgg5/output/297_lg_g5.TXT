BARCELONA



South Korean tech giants Samsung Electronics and LG on Sunday unveiled new

smartphones with better cameras and turned to virtual reality to boost interest

in their headsets at a time of slowing sales.



Samsung launched two versions of its flagship phone, the flat screen Galaxy S7

and the curved screen Galaxy S7 edge, with cameras that can take better pictures

under low-light conditions.



First 360-degree camera



The company, the world's number one smartphone maker, also debuted its first

360-degree camera, the Gear 360, in Barcelona where the mobile industry is

gathered for the start of the Mobile World Congress yesterday, in its latest

attempt to remain ahead of Apple.



The camera is designed to make it easy to take all-around photos and videos that

can be uploaded to Facebook and YouTube, or viewed as immersive experiences on

Samsung's virtual reality Gear VR headsets which went on sale in November.



"User generated 360-degree photos and films are going to see rapid growth in

2016. Numerous 360-degree cameras are being launched and users will want to get

access to this content," said Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight.



"Although it can be viewed on a standard smartphone or PC screen, looking at

this content with a VR headset has the most impact, this is undoubtedly going to

drive sales of these products."



Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a surprise appearance at the

Samsung press conference to announce a partnership with the South Korean firm to

promote the use of virtual reality on the social network.



"We want to make Facebook the best video platform for virtual reality and

Samsung is the only company in the world that can provide a good experience in

terms of virtual reality," he said.



Rival South Korean tech firm LG sought to steal Samsung's thunder by unveiling

its new premium handset, the G5, its first modular smartphone which is made

using different components that can be independently upgraded or replaced such

as a removable battery.



Focus on accessories



The G5 comes with several accessories such as a sound system developed by Danish

firm Bang and Olufsen and a virtual reality headset which will allow it to

compete with a headset launched by Samsung late last year.



The focus on accessories comes with the smartphone market beginning to slow as

it becomes increasingly saturated.



LG's parent company LG Electronics' net profit halved last year on the back of a

global economic slowdown and increased competition in the mobile sector while

Samsung was only able to boost its market share moderately.



Apple, which will not be present at the congress in Barcelona, saw iPhone sales

fall for the first time on an annual basis in the final quarter of last year,

according to Gartner.



The market research firm said that the 9.7-per-cent increase in smartphone sales

in the final quarter of last year over the same period in 2014 takes the

industry all the way back to 2008 when the global economy was in crisis.



"All of these additional devices, whether it is a virtual reality goggle,

whether it is a camera, whether it is a smartwatch, they are all ways of

generating additional profits," said Ian Fogg, the head mobile and technology

analyst at IHS Technology.



Analysts said handset makers face a tough choice. Focus on the low-price

segment, where sales volumes are large but margins become thin. Or focus on

features which can differentiate their phones.



"We are moving towards a logic of segmentation and improvement, with a better

camera or more autonomy for example, maybe some advances in virtual reality, but

there will unlikely be any major innovation," said Thomas Husson, an analyst at

Forrester.
