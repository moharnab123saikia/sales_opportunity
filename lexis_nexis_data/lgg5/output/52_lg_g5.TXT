Hardware designers could fall in love with LG G5?

First impressions of the LG G5 recollected Google's project Ara, one of the

Google ATAP team's projects led by former DARPA chief Regina Dugan to prove the

viability of building a modular mobile hardware ecosystem. The goal of the

project is to enable users to create a modular smartphone that is precisely

tailored to their functional and aesthetic preferences.



Before dismissing the G5's modularity take a fresh look at it. For the moment

just suspend your disbelief about modularity or pretend that modularity wasn't

announced. It is a beautifully executed flagship phone designed and produced by

one of the best mobile shops in the world.



The specifications look like the requirements set by a consumer that wants to

spend an estimated $650 to $750 that flagships like this cost. (LG's

announcement did not include an exact price or release date.)

     ·    External MicroSD support (up to 200GB)





     ·    64bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC





     ·    Adreno 520 GPU





     ·    20 MP Primary camera with 4k Video Support, Optical Image

          Stabilisation, Laser Autofocus,





     ·    HDR, Panorama





     ·    2800 mAh Li-ion removable battery with Quick Charge 3.0





Vivid colorful screen, fast processor and graphics, great camera and the two

features that consumers howled about losing in many recent smartphone designs, a

removable battery and MicroSD slots. There will never be a battery large enough

nor enough internal ROM storage for every user's needs.



In a nutshell the G5 can be described as superior components housed in a

polished metal unibody. Taken together the G5 stands up to other flagships like

the iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy S7.



Returning to the G5's modularity, LG introduced two swappable modules. Pull down

on the bottom to release the battery drawer and slide in the LG Cam Pro or the

LG Hi-Fi Pro to customize the G5. The LG Cam Pro expands the battery to 4000mAh

for all-day shooting and adds a focus wheel and separate point-and-shoot types

of buttons for video and photos. The module's shape produces a comfortable and

natural grip. The LG Hi-Fi Pro was developed in partnership with B&O Play,

offering a 32-bit DAC and amp, designed to produce an audiophile experience from

a smartphone.

Without hands-on testing of the Cam Pro and Hi-Fi Pro and knowing the prices

it's hard to predict how consumers will respond to these modules. But depending

on how LG has designed the hardware and software interfaces it could be the

first company to create an ecosystem of partners that build on its platform.

Google's project Ara proved that a smartphone can be built with modules

independently designed using a published software reference design. If the G5 is

engineered using a similar structured approach - systems designers could be

attracted to build new modules. And the more G5s and similarly modular LG phones

that ship the more system designers that will be attracted.



Building an Android module for the G5 eliminates building all but the

proprietary software components that differentiate the module and reduces

project risk because many custom products were already engineered with this

operating system. The Android operating system has been applied to many

applications other than smartphones, smartwatches and tablets. Android automates

treadmills, thermostats and vending machines to mention a few. It can be

recompiled for new hardware systems and it fits almost any application where a

touch interface and communications with other devices and cloud based systems

needs to be added to a product like log into a treadmill to track exercise.



Like familiarity with Android software reduces time-to-market and risk, so does

designing a module with G5 hardware because so many design engineers have

experience working with the underlying hardware components. Qualcomm, MediaTek

and other mobile chip makers deliver reference designs with CPUs and GPUs and

send their own system engineers to teach customers in order to accelerate their

customers' time-to-market.



What might be built with the G5 modular platform is anyone's guess. LG might

just give customers more choices to change the price performance of its phones

by replacing a camera module or screen with one that's better or less expensive.

But there are many mundane and exotic possibilities. A very low cost EKG used to

monitor a patient at home springs immediately to mind. There is a rich variety

of microsensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) that can control

projectors, switch optical signals, identify chemical and biological substances

using mass spectrometry that could be built as a module.



If LG has built the G5 as the first in a product line of modular mobile devices

and is committed to making systems companies that design for its modular

platform successful, LG could gain the first mover advantage in modular mobile

devices.
