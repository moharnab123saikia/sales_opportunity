LENGTH: 227 words





LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday it will showcase a new pen-equipped smartphone

at next week's Mobile World Congress (MWC) in a bid to diversify its

non-flagship models and attract a wider scope of users.



The LG Stylus 2 smartphone, to be unveiled at the world's biggest tech show,

will come with a pen that has a cloth tip, providing an almost-real writing

experience to users, along with convenient menus and note-related features to go

along with the pen, LG said.



The MWC is slated to kick off in Barcelona next Monday for a four-day run,

showcasing the latest mobile devices and technologies.



The smartphone also comes with a 5.7-inch screen and weighs around 145 grams. It

has 13 and 8 megapixel cameras and a 3,000 mAh battery.



The device will hit shelves in South Korea next month and gradually expand to

other markets including North America and Europe.



LG Electronics aims to revitalize its ailing smartphone business by introducing

the flagship G5 smartphone in Barcelona.



The company also said earlier this week that it will showcase two budget

smartphones at the event, each boasting high-end features like dual screens or

three cameras.



LG's mobile business posted an operating loss of 43.8 billion won (US$36

million) in the fourth quarter last year, continuing its sluggish performance

after the loss of 77.6 billion won posted a quarter earlier. (Yonhap)
