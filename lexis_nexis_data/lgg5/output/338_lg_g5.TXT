LG simple can't wait to show off their new smartphones at this year's MWC.

Shortly after announcing that LG will be releasing the LG X Cam and LG X Screen,

the Korean company has announced the LG Stylus 2, a sequel to the popular LG G4

Stylus, or the G4 Stylo.



This variation of the LG G4 sacrificed the top notch camera of the G4, but in

turn bumped the screen size up from 5.5 inches to 5.7 inches, and included a

stylus for note taking and doodles. The sequel, the LG Stylus 2, comes with the

same 5.7 inch display and a 13MP camera on the back and an 8MP camera on the

front. However, the new version will be smaller than its predecessor, being only

7.4mm thick and weighing just 145g.



The stylus in the LG Stylus 2 will be thinner, and have a nano-coated tip

fitted. According to the company, this nano-coating, "not only gives a real

pen-like feel," but also "allows for more accuracy when note taking and drawing

compared to a rubber-tipped pen." Once the stylus is removed, the screen

automatically shows a Pen Pop menu, with shortcuts for memo writing or scanning

apps.



The LG Stylus 2 will be revealed at the MWC next week along with the LG G5 and

the LG X Cam and LG X Screen.
