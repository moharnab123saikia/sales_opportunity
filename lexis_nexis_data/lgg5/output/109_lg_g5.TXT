The Nation



It's great to have LG smartphones back on the Thai market â[#x20ac]" especially

now that there's a new flagship model, the G5, which is truly impressive in

quality and has not one but two cameras at the back.



The G series has always been top quality in terms of performance, offering

superb alternatives to the more expensive Android phones, so it was

disappointing when LG Thailand indefinitely suspended distribution late last

year.



"Indefinitely" thankfully turned out to be not too long, however. TG Fone

recently became the exclusive dealer of the G5 in Thailand. The model's been

available elsewhere for a while, but for us it proves to be worth the wait. The

G5 boasts a premium build, terrific performance, fast data connection,

expandability for extra features, and that unique three-camera set-up.



The sleek, 7.7mm-thin aluminium body comes in pink, gold or titanium, nicely

curved at the edges and a lightweight 159 grams. The 3D Arc Glass display is

also gently bevelled at the top for a seamless overall look.



Users can get at the battery to replace it, which is not the case with most

other brands. You just press a button and slide out the bottom cap attached to

the 2,800mAh rechargeable battery.



The battery life is excellent thanks to Low Power Location Estimation

technology, which boosts efficiency by nearly 42 per cent by improving the way

your location-based apps use power.



On top of that, Quick Charge 3.0 uses an intelligent algorithm to replenish the

battery 27 per cent quicker and 45 per cent more efficiently than in previous

models.



The replaceable battery is part of the plan to make the phone expandable with

optional modules called LG Friends that plug into the same place. TG Fone has

two add-on modules available for now.



LG Cam Plus (Bt2,990) adds a camera grip, shutter button, zoom dial and

video-record button to the phone, all of which are quite useful. You get that

genuine camera feel, including half-pressing the shutter to focus.



LG Hi-Fi Plus (Bt4,990) is a must if you love high-quality music on the go,

because it's a 32-bit Hi-Fi digital-to-analogue converter and headphone

amplifier with the signature sound of B&O Play, an outfit renowned for its

high-fidelity products.



TG Fone does have another LG Friend, though it's not modular. LG 360 Cam

(Bt8,390) instead links wirelessly to the G5 for 360-degree shots and videos at

13-megapixel resolution that can be shared on Google Street View and YouTube

360.



Soon enough you'll need the Friends Manager, an application already built in

that connects the modules with minimal fuss. The manager automatically detects

whatever's nearby and makes the connection in three simple steps.



The G5's exceptional performance is due to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core

processor and an ample four gigabytes of working memory. A lot of phones are

using eight-core chips these days, but the G5 has Qualcomm's quad-core chip,

meaning fewer cores than the 810, its predecessor. But LG says this doesn't

affect performance, since most Android apps don't need eight cores anyway, and

the 820, at 64 bits, performs twice as well as the 810.



The 820 adds Adreno 530 graphics, lower-power Hexagon DSP and Spectra 14-bit

dual-image signal processors that deliver high-resolution, DSLR-quality pictures

while also saving power. Adreno 530 handles graphics up to 40 per cent faster

and more powerfully than the previous generation.



I found while testing the G5 that the touchscreen and menus were very responsive

and both videos and graphic-based games played smoothly, as did high-resolution

audio files at FLAC 24bit/192kHz. Even without a Hi-Fi DAC or headphone amp

module, the G5 can still be a high-quality digital-music player. I ran the tunes

through Sony's MDR-1ABT headset and found the quality top-notch, with plenty of

detail and bass.



With the G5 you also get aptX HD, an enhanced codec for Bluetooth-generated

24-bit sound, so the music remains rich and clear even over a wireless

connection when heard through the right headphones (like the optional LG Tone

Platinum headphones).



One pre-installed app I love is called LG Health, a tracker for daily activities

that can synchronise with Google Fitness. It will log the number of steps taken

and duration of cycling outings, power walks, runs and stair climbs.



The G5 is quick in connecting to LTE 4G networks such as TrueMove H's and

uploading photos to the cloud. The Ookla Speedtest app measured downloads at

107.88Mbps, the fastest I've seen while testing phones, and uploads at

19.96Mbps.



The 5.3-inch Quad HD IPS Quantum display is bright and colourful and there's a

handy "Always-on" feature so you see the time and date even when the phone's in

sleep mode (discretely perfect for business meetings).



Power consumption is minimised with redesigned display driver IC memory

â[#x20ac]" the backlighting illuminates only one small part of the overall

display, so even with Always-on, you're using just 0.8 per cent of the battery's

full capacity per hour.



Daylight Mode is a big improvement in outdoor visibility. Light conditions are

automatically detected and the brightness of the display is instantaneously

increased or decreased.



Now, about the dual cameras at the rear, an outstanding advance in my view:

There really are two cameras â[#x20ac]" not two lenses â[#x20ac]" each with its

own image sensor from Sony. Both get fine pictures, with sharp details and

well-saturated colours.



The main camera has 16-megapixel resolution and uses a fast f/1.8-aperture lens

with image stabilisation. You have a 78-degree angle of view, similar to most

flagship smartphones, but what's truly amazing is the second rear camera with

f/2.4 aperture, 8MP sensor and super-wide-angle 135-degree lens.



This is 1.7 times wider than anything else found on a phone â[#x20ac]" and 15

degrees wider than the human eye's field of view. You can imagine how useful

this is getting shots of landscapes, tall buildings and large groups of people.

You might never have to "back up" again.



I just had to press an on-screen button and could easily see subjects that

didn't even appear through a normal-angle lens. Plus, you can switch back and

forth between rear cameras with another press of a button. Look for the tree

icons â[#x20ac]" one, two or three depending on the angle you want. Zooming in

and out automatically switches between wide-angle and general needs.



The G5's camera app has Multi-view mode for taking shots with each of the

phone's three cameras, which are then combined into a single superior image.



Another fun mode, Pop-out Picture, will frame a photo or video taken through the

normal lens within the matching image taken with the wide-angle. The effect can

be quite striking. And Film Effect can apply nine different movie textures to an

image.



The general-use camera focuses automatically very fast, displaying the

auto-focus points on the screen just like a DSLR camera.



Meanwhile the 8MP front camera has a "display flash" function that's useful when

taking selfies in dim surroundings.



You can get the G5 from TG Fone for Bt21,900.
