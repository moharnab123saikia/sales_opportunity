Hack risk hits 900m phones RUKI SAYID CYBER security experts have found flaws in

the Android system that could let hackers seize control of 900million

smartphones.



Four weaknesses have been discovered in chips used in Google, Sony, LG, HTC and

Blackberry phones.



Security firm Checkpoint, who spotted the problems, say crooks could use them to

get access to all the data on phones.



There is currently no evidence that hackers have exploited the flaws, but

Michael Shaulov of Checkpoint said: "I'm pretty sure you will see these

vulnerabilities being used in the next three to four months."



Phones with chips made by Qualcomm are affected by the "Quadrooter" flaws.



Models sold in the UK include Sony Xperia Z Ultra, HTC One, HTC M9 and HTC 10,

LG G4, LG G5 and LG V10, Google Nexus 5X, Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P and BlackBerry

Priv and Dtek50.



Qualcomm said they had made patches for the flaws available to phone makers.



Google said users with the latest security updates were protected from three of

the four flaws and an update for the fourth would be ready next month. A

Quadrooter scanner is available free from the Google Play store.
