as Virtual Reality Takes Step Forward at 2016 GSMA Mobile World Congress

March 3 -- Virtual reality (VR) took a step forward at the 2016 GSMA Mobile

World Congress (MWC). At the Samsung S7 launch, Mark Zuckerberg spoke of the

Oculus/Samsung partnership and the rising popularity of 360-degree video. HTC's

VIVE showed continued maturity in its adeptness for PC gamers, and Google

Cardboard won for Best Mobile App (Judge's Choice) at the GSMA 2016 Glomo

Awards. Given the market's current growth trajectory, ABI Research, the leader

in transformative technology innovation market intelligence, anticipates mobile

VR device shipments to hit more than 50 million by 2020, an impressive CAGR of

84.5%.



To many in the industry, Google Cardboard served as the ultimate launch pad for

the now rapidly growing, if nascent, ecosystem for low-cost VR. In fact, Google

recently announced that the company hit a milestone of 5 million Cardboard

shipments this January, since its debut at Google I/0 2014.



"The VR content ecosystem is opening up to include casual and traditional VR

gaming, as well as education experiences," says Sam Rosen, Managing Director and

Vice President at ABI Research and 2016 Glomo Awards judge. "360-degree video

also saw notable investment from Facebook and YouTube, pointing to another

promising VR growth opportunity. While content developers are still learning how

consumers engage with mobile-reliant VR systems, VR in core gaming and augmented

reality are on well-defined growth trajectories."



As the ecosystem expands, a growing number of vendors are releasing their own VR

accessories as a value-add to their smartphones. At MWC 2016, Samsung announced

its new flagship smartphones, the S7 and S7 Edge, with the addendum that all

preorders for the devices be bundled with Samsung's new Gear VR. Similarly, LG

announced it will offer hardware modules built to improve certain aspects of its

new G5 phone, and also revealed a VR accessory in the LG 360 VR.



"Smartphones are the perfect platform for the VR market, because they already

have the power and technological functionality necessary to create a fun,

in-depth simulated environment," concludes Eric Abbruzzese, Research Analyst at

ABI Research. "As their capabilities continue to evolve, we anticipate high-end

VR, which is currently exclusive to PC and game consoles, to expand to

mobile-powered uses by 2020. Google Cardboard is just the beginning; in the

years to come, independent growth across major markets, including mobile

devices, wearables, gaming, advertising, and data, will all synergize and power

the next stage of transformational growth in mobile VR."



These findings are part of ABI Research's Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality

Service, which includes research reports, market data, insights, and competitive

assessments.
