Enjoy some of the most stunning 360 wallpapers on the LG G5



What good is VR when you don't have the right wallpapers to enjoy it with? Well,

LG thought of that, and has come out with new 360 degree landscapes for free

download, so that LG users can have 360 degree images on their G5 phones.



The 360 Wallpaper feature allows users to set a spherical image as their phone

wallpaper, which will behave like any other VR image. By moving the device

around, the background will move as well. Additionally, the photos can also be

viewed in a Cinematic View, while the LG 360 CAM captures the spherical photos

that can be used as wallpapers on the G5 or uploaded to Google Street View.



G5 users will also have free access to stunning wallpapers taken by professional

photographers, which includes amazing scenery shots as well as shots of famous

cities around the world. The users will have access to 12 photos first, with

four new images to be added each month.



"The G5 is designed to deliver a playful mobile experience to customers and

360-degree imagery is a key part of that experience," said Chris Yie, vice

president and head of marketing communications for LG Mobile Communications

Company. "360-degree photography is still in its early stages but we believe it

will drive adoption of VR innovation in the mobile space."



The images will be available between April and November in all 69 countries

where LG SmartWorld is available. Users can download the 360 degree wallpapers

on their phones from www.LGworld.com or download the Android app for more

information on the wallpapers as well as a chance to win prizes and gifts.
