While we are waiting for the latest Nexus phones from HTC to show up later this
year, it was quite surprising to see that there arent much leaks out there,
until now.

A new leak for the HTC Nexus Sailfish, or the HTC S1 gives us details regarding
the screen size as well as a few details about the processor as well. According
to the leaked build.prop file for the phone, there is a mention of an "msm8996",
which is the part number of the Snapdragon 820, the same chip you'll find in the
OnePlus 3, HTC 10 and LG G5. There also seems to be a LCD screen density value
of 420, which roughly amounts to a 5.2 inch screen of 1080 x 1920 resolution.
However, the larger Nexus Marlin might have a QHD panel.

Other details talk about a fingerprint scanner which will be used to unlock the
phone as well as to authorize Google Android Pay. There are also mentions about
the phone's support for Google Daydream. However, it is pretty obvious that the
HTC S1 wont be a flagship device, while the 5.5 inch HTC M1/ Nexus Marlin might
be.
