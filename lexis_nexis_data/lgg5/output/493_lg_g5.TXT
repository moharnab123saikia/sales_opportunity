Chatterbot, WowWee, $50



Having a Fairy Godfather blathering away by your computer might work for kids

doing homework -- since we know all they're doing is chatting with friends

anyway -- but it could wear thin with your cubicle neighbours at the office.

Also in dog/cat and devil/angel versions, the Chatterbots come courtesy of

WowWee, maker of flying and grounded robots. With more than 2,000 keywords,

jokes and different actions in their repertoire, some of it at about the level

of bathroom humour, it plugs into the USB outlet on a computer. It can synch

with your calendar and comment on upcoming events or add batteries and plug into

an MP3 to work as a standalone speaker. Works with PCs or Intel-based Mac

computers. The perfect gift for someone you'd really like to annoy with a steady

stream of wacky banter. www.wowwee.com



iWave Cube, $130



At one cubic foot (.03 cubic metres) and taking up the space of two small

computer speakers, it's a portable microwave so you don't even need to leave

your desk to heat up those nachos. Just what you need after sitting at your

computer for hours -- an excuse not to stand up to heat some food. Don't blame

us for that aching back. Weighing only 5.5 kilograms, it plugs into a standard

outlet and comes with a built-in carrier handle and a view-through door.

LG Rumour, $75 with a three-year plan with Bell Mobility



With a full QWERTY keyboard, a camera, camcorder and MP3 player, the Rumour is

an all-in-one cellphone. The keyboard slides out, offering access to Facebook

and it comes with Windows Live Messenger pre-installed so you can keep up your

social networking on the go. The Rumour is Bluetooth capable with a four

gigabyte expandable memory port. It's available now through Bell in both white

and black, with SaskTel and Virgin Mobile slated to add it to their lineups

later this year. Check it out at www.ca.lge.com.



Westinghouse Digital 26'' LCD HDTV/DVD Combo Unit, $600



For the cottage, the boat or the dorm room, this is another all-in-one and this

time it's all about entertainment. A trim package houses a high-def television,

with front loading DVD player and multiple HD input connectors including two

HDMI. It delivers 1366-by-768 resolution. At:
