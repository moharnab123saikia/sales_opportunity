Decoded Dual cameras

The phrase "dual camera" is self explanatory, but why exactly are two cameras

better than one?



1. Smartphone cameras have a few inherent restrictions: not only are there other

internal components that require space of their own, reducing what manufacturers

can dedicate for imaging, but these cameras are also limited in comparison to

their digital counterparts.



2. Smartphone camera lenses cannot zoom, as there's no way to incorporate the

hardware necessary without a huge bump on the back panel. These lenses are

locked to a fixed focus, and digital zoom can only give you so much before

there's a serious tradeoff in quality. That's where one type of dual camera,

featured in the LG G5 for example, comes into play. The second camera is a wide

angle lens, allowing the user to capture more in the frame, while the primary

camera can grab details in closeups.



3. Another type, is like what the new Huawei P9 has. Both cameras are set behind

lenses that have the same focal length, but one has a full color sensor and the

other monochrome. The magic lies in the monochrome sensor--without a color

filter it can capture a higher dynamic range, resulting in brighter photos even

in dark conditions. Images from both sensors are automatically merged to create

a better lit, higher quality photo.
