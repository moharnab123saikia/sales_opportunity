Jason Statham's new LG advert: just as nonsensical as his films;

The legendary screen hardman uses his full range of acting in this bizarre phone

ad

LG's new G5 phone is a curious bit of kit: essentially a workaday-looking

smartphone, but one that features a weird slidey thing at the bottom to remove,

and quite likely lose, your battery. LG have branded this design kink as modular

and "transformative", so who better to get across this sense of transformation

than Jason Statham, the hyper-versatile actor known for playing a chiselled hard

man in Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, a chiselled hard man in the

Transporter series, and a chiselled hard man in Crank and its even crankier

sequel Crank: High Voltage?



In fairness Stath's turn in the ad suggests that he might have a bit more range

than his IMDB page. Here, he plays an entire bloody city, with his face

transposed on to everyone from a hipster to a newborn baby (a sight which will

require an extensive period of brain bleaching to unsee). The plot, or what

there is of one, sees the city's inhabitants' crippling phone addiction, leading

them to fight each other for a glimpse at a screen, setting off a bizarre

sequence of events involving a motorcyclist on fire and a load of rampaging

bulls. No less nonsensical than the rest of Statham's output, then.
