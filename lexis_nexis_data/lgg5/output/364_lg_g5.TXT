smartphone, but one that features a weird slidey thing at the bottom to remove,
and quite likely lose, your battery. LG have branded this design kink as modular
and "transformative", so who better to get across this sense of transformation
than Jason Statham, the hyper-versatile actor known for playing a chiselled hard
man in Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, a chiselled hard man in the
Transporter series, and a chiselled hard man in Crank and its even crankier
sequel Crank: High Voltage?

In fairness Stath's turn in the ad suggests that he might have a bit more range
than his IMDB page. Here, he plays an entire bloody city, with his face
transposed on to everyone from a hipster to a newborn baby (a sight which will
require an extensive period of brain bleaching to unsee). The plot, or what
there is of one, sees the city's inhabitants' crippling phone addiction, leading
them to fight each other for a glimpse at a screen, setting off a bizarre
sequence of events involving a motorcyclist on fire and a load of rampaging
bulls. No less nonsensical than the rest of Statham's output, then.
