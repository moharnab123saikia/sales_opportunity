HTC 10 gets a design upgrade

If you thought that the HTC 10 would be the exact same phone as last year, get

ready to be proven wrong, as the company is switching up the design in more than

a few ways.



According to the latest leak from the company, the new Android phone will come

with capacitive buttons and a fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint sensor looks

quite similar to the oval shaped fingerprint sensor seen on the HTC One A9,

while the capacitive buttons seem inspired by the HTC One M7. This design change

might also take away the front facing speakers as the fingerprint sensor and the

buttons will take its place. However, earlier leaks suggested that the HTC 10

will still come with BoomSound.



All these design changes are positive shakeups for the company, as some of the

previous models seemed the same. With these new changes, the BoomSound speakers

might have to move to the bottom frame of the phone as well. The leaked image

does not have an HTC logo as well.



It is just a matter of waiting to see if the HTC 10 will compete against the

likes of the Samsung S7, s7 Edge and LG G5.
