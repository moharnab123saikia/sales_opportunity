

FOR the fifth consecutive year, LG Electronics' LGOLED TV was once again named
the best high-end TV in Europe by the European Imaging and Sound Association
(EISA). The EISA Awards is decided annually by a panel of experts from 50
multimedia magazines from 20 European countries who evaluates innovative
products for their technological capabilities, design and innovation.

As the European High-End TV Award winner, LG Signature OLED TV (model 65G6) was
cited as being "truly state-of-the-art" by the judges who were impressed by its
ability to deliver perfect black for an incredible picture. The jury also
commended LG Signature OLED TV for its support of both HDR 10 and Dolby Vision.

"We are honored to receive EISA's most prestigious award for the fifth
consecutive year and every award is just as rewarding as the previous one," said
Brian Kwon, president of the LG Home Entertainment Company at LG Electronics.
"This recognition confirms our belief that LG Signature OLED TV is an
outstanding feat of engineering with breathtaking picture clarity and
revolutionary design."

Another LG TV, LG UH770V SUPER UHD TV, was recognized with the European Smart TV
Award for its impressive picture quality as well as for its intuitive webOS 3.0
user interface. LG's mobile division also landed an award for its LG G5
smartphone, which received the European Mobile Innovation Award for its modular
type design and full metal uni-body. - SG
