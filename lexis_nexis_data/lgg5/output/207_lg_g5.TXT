

That's a wrap on LG's mods.

The LG G5 launched earlier this year and came with a new concept of modular
accessories, however, it looks like the feature wont be making it to the LG G6.

The Mods, called LG Friends, would allow you to clip in and out to boost battery
capacity, add advanced camera controls, or improve the audio pumping out of your
phone's speakers. However, according to reports from Electronic Times of Korea,
this might be the last we see of the mods, as the LG G6 will revert back to the
solid slab of glass and metal design. The reason behind it is simple, LG G5
didn't sell well. Even though it managed to get decent reviews, the  average
smartphone buyer was less than pleased about having to fork out more money for
extra add-ons, as interesting as they were.

Meanwhile, LG also had issues with manufacturing the mods due to lack of
supplies. The Bang & Olufsen audio module wasn't available when the phone
actually launched, for instance.

Modular phones have been having a bad year all around, as the famed Google
Project Ara also got cancelled recently. However, Motorola's Moto Z with its
Moto Mods might be a saving grace. Letting go of the modular approach is in fact
quite sad, as it is hard to see more developers working on something new and
different and the modular approach held quite a bit of potential.
