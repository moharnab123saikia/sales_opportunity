LG G6 wont have any modular features



LENGTH: 222  words





That's a wrap on LG's mods.



The LG G5 launched earlier this year and came with a new concept of modular

accessories, however, it looks like the feature wont be making it to the LG G6.



The Mods, called LG Friends, would allow you to clip in and out to boost battery

capacity, add advanced camera controls, or improve the audio pumping out of your

phone's speakers. However, according to reports from Electronic Times of Korea,

this might be the last we see of the mods, as the LG G6 will revert back to the

solid slab of glass and metal design. The reason behind it is simple, LG G5

didn't sell well. Even though it managed to get decent reviews, the  average

smartphone buyer was less than pleased about having to fork out more money for

extra add-ons, as interesting as they were.



Meanwhile, LG also had issues with manufacturing the mods due to lack of

supplies. The Bang & Olufsen audio module wasn't available when the phone

actually launched, for instance.



Modular phones have been having a bad year all around, as the famed Google

Project Ara also got cancelled recently. However, Motorola's Moto Z with its

Moto Mods might be a saving grace. Letting go of the modular approach is in fact

quite sad, as it is hard to see more developers working on something new and

different and the modular approach held quite a bit of potential.
