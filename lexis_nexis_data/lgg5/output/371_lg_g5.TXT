[THE INVESTOR] LG Electronics will unveil a new premium smartphone this week as

it seeks to revive its struggling handset business.



The V20 smartphone, to be announced on Sept. 7 in Seoul, is the first smartphone

in the world to run on Google's latest Android mobile operating system called

Nougat.



Following disappointing sales of another premium smartphone, the G5, earlier

this year, LG's handset business division posted its fifth consecutive quarterly

operating loss in the second quarter.



Details of the V20 will be announced on Sept. 7, but industry sources said the

new premium smartphone features high-end audio quality, by integrating a 32-bit

Hi-Fi Quad DAC (digital to analog converter)technology into the device.



Invitation card sent by LG to Korean and foreign press for the upcoming LG V20

release event in San Francisco.



Co-engineered by Denmark's luxury brand for stereo devices, Bang & Olufsen, the

device also boasts a high-end audio resolution.



In a previous statement, LG said the V20 adopted Google's new search app called

In Apps.



"The new search mode featured in the Google app helps users find content not

only from built-in apps, including contacts, emails, text messages and photos

but also from user-installed apps," LG said in the statement.



In-store sales of the V20 are expected to begin later this month.
