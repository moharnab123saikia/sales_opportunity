more for your money with bundled accessories or vouchers. GITEX Shopper spring
edition is currently going on at DWTC and will last till the 2nd of April. Here
are some of the hottest deals by Jumbo this year:

LG V10

Although LG has announced the LG G5, the V10 is a fantastic phone with a bigger
display and a rugged look. Jumbo has priced it at AED 2199 and giving away
freebies such as an AED 150 gift voucher, a Ted Lapidus watch, a selfie stick, a
power bank and a backpack.
