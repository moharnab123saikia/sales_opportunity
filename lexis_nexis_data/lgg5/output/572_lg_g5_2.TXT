
DATELINE: TORONTO


TORONTO - The Toronto stock market finished slightly higher Wednesday as gains
in the information technology sector countered losses in the energy sector while
investors took in higher interest rates.

The Bank of Canada hiked its key interest rate by a quarter point to 2.75 per
cent in an effort to keep inflation under control.

New York markets added to Tuesday's strong gains as the price of oil moved below
$65 US a barrel and investors hoped the U.S. Federal Reserve will back off from
raising interest rates as the economy absorbs the impact of hurricane Katrina.

The Canadian dollar was ahead slightly after the interest rate hike, closing up
0.03 of a cent at 84.15 cents US as investors wondered about the pace of future
hikes.

"I think over the next year I would expect further interest rate increases
coming from the bank as the economy continues to improve," said Rick Egelton,
chief economist at Bank of Montreal.

Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index moved 11.93 points higher to 10,810.05. The
TSX Venture Exchange was up 2.72 at 1,952.45.

The major Canadian corporate story came from the health sector. British
pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline said it has agreed to buy Vancouver-based
ID Biomedical for $1.7 billion. Shares in ID Biomedical charged ahead $4.07 to
$35.05.

The Dow industrial average rose 44.26 points to 10,633.5 on top of Tuesday's
142-point surge.

The Nasdaq composite index was up 5.17 points at 2,172.03 and the Standard &
Poor's 500 index gained 2.97 points at 1,236.36.

"It's evident the Goldilocks scenario is back on: don't worry, be happy because
Katrina will not make the Fed raise rates as much as we feared," said Gavin
Graham, vice-president and director of investments at Guardian Group of Funds.

The October contract for crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange moved $1.59
lower to $64.37 US a barrel.

$57.86.

Tech stocks led advancers in Toronto as Nortel Networks Corp. gained 21 cents to
$3.86 on a heavy volume of 19 million shares after Korea's KTF picked LG
Electronics and the

Ontario-based company for broadband wireless service.

On the economic front, Statistics Canada said $4.9-billion worth of building
permits was issued in July, down three per cent from June.

Investors also took in economic data that showed growth in U.S. productivity
slowed in the second quarter while labour costs edged up. The developments raise
concerns about inflation pressures down the road.

On the TSX, advances beat declines 742 to 670 with 238 unchanged.
