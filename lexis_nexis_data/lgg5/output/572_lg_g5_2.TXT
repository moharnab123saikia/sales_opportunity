TORONTO - The Toronto stock market finished slightly higher Wednesday as gains

in the information technology sector countered losses in the energy sector while

investors took in higher interest rates.



The Bank of Canada hiked its key interest rate by a quarter point to 2.75 per

cent in an effort to keep inflation under control.



New York markets added to Tuesday's strong gains as the price of oil moved below

$65 US a barrel and investors hoped the U.S. Federal Reserve will back off from

raising interest rates as the economy absorbs the impact of hurricane Katrina.



The Canadian dollar was ahead slightly after the interest rate hike, closing up

0.03 of a cent at 84.15 cents US as investors wondered about the pace of future

hikes.



"I think over the next year I would expect further interest rate increases

coming from the bank as the economy continues to improve," said Rick Egelton,

chief economist at Bank of Montreal.



Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index moved 11.93 points higher to 10,810.05. The

TSX Venture Exchange was up 2.72 at 1,952.45.



The major Canadian corporate story came from the health sector. British

pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline said it has agreed to buy Vancouver-based

ID Biomedical for $1.7 billion. Shares in ID Biomedical charged ahead $4.07 to

$35.05.



The Dow industrial average rose 44.26 points to 10,633.5 on top of Tuesday's

142-point surge.



The Nasdaq composite index was up 5.17 points at 2,172.03 and the Standard &

Poor's 500 index gained 2.97 points at 1,236.36.



"It's evident the Goldilocks scenario is back on: don't worry, be happy because

Katrina will not make the Fed raise rates as much as we feared," said Gavin

Graham, vice-president and director of investments at Guardian Group of Funds.



The October contract for crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange moved $1.59

lower to $64.37 US a barrel.



West Texas Intermed moved up to $64.38 a barrel.



The TSX energy sector fell 0.55 per cent as EnCana Corp. moved 27 cents lower to

$57.86.



Tech stocks led advancers in Toronto as Nortel Networks Corp. gained 21 cents to

$3.86 on a heavy volume of 19 million shares after Korea's KTF picked LG

Electronics and the



Ontario-based company for broadband wireless service.



On the economic front, Statistics Canada said $4.9-billion worth of building

permits was issued in July, down three per cent from June.



Investors also took in economic data that showed growth in U.S. productivity

slowed in the second quarter while labour costs edged up. The developments raise

concerns about inflation pressures down the road.



On the TSX, advances beat declines 742 to 670 with 238 unchanged.



In other news, Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. shares climbed nine cents to $5.26

after the company said it is selling its 50-per-cent ownership in Pan Asia Paper

Co. to Norske Skog for $600 million US.
