Cover story: Vehicles are the best they've ever been, but is that going be

enough to overcome challenges the U.S. economy faces in the new year?



While the new year is still young enough for most people to be filled with

excitement and hope, automakers and car dealers are facing what could shape up

to be one of the worst car-selling years in at least a decade.



With the national slowdown in new-home sales becoming ever-more severe and the

threat of a serious recession growing increasingly certain, 2008 is going to be

a tough year for many people. And the car market suffers especially during times

of uncertainty: It was the housing bust that sunk 2007, which was on track to be

a great year for car sales.



At the same time, the auto market faces a double whammy of recalibrated EPA

mileage numbers for 2008 models, which significantly lowered the figures on

window stickers, just in time for the government to raise the average economy

automakers are expected to make people buy by 2020. To put the new goal in

perspective, the tiny Smart ForTwo, which many thought could be a solution, is

rated barely above the mandate, and it only has two doors and interior space

strictly designed for two people.



All of that is a great shame because 2008 promises to be one of the best years

in history, in terms of the vehicles for sale in the U.S. New models

increasingly offer more convenience features, including iPod connectors,

Bluetooth compatibility, smart-key systems and heated/cooled seats. Safety --

both active and passive -- is at an all-time high, and under-hood technology is

making modern cars cleaner, more efficient and more reliable than ever before.



That's the good news: There has never been a better time to buy a car. Here's

what you can look forward to in 2008.



AUDI



The TT coupe and roadster went on sale last spring. The new models are larger

than their predecessors and feature refinements in design, ergonomics and ride.

Two engines are offered: A turbocharged 200-hp 2-liter four and a 250-hp

3.2-liter V-6.



But the most anticipated Audi this year is the exotic-looking R8. Audi's first

mid-engine sports car, the lightweight all-wheel-drive R8 looks like it just

came off a European racetrack.



The A5/S5 mark the first time since 1991 that Audi will sell a four-seat coupe

in the United States. The S5 has a 354-hp 4.2-liter V-8 that can propel the car

to 60 mph in a brief 5 seconds while the 2008 A5 arrives in this country in

early 2008 with a 265-hp 3.2-liter V-6.



Lastly, Audi adds a new convertible in 2008 as the RS 4 Cabriolet joins the

sporty RS 4 sedan. Like its hardtop mate, the RS 4 Cabrio has a 420-hp 4.2-liter

V-8 under the hood, all-wheel-drive and a sport-tuned suspension.



BMW



BMW began selling its revised-for-2008 5-Series cars earlier this year.

Six-cylinder models got new names to, sort of, reflect larger, more powerful

engines -- 525i became 528i to reflect its 230-hp 3-liter; 530i became 535i when

it got the twin-turbo 300-hp 3-liter introduced in the smaller 3 Series



BMW also updated the interiors of these sedans and wagons and adds optional Lane

Departure Warning that subtly vibrates the steering wheel when it detects a

driver might be wandering out of his or her lane.



The hot M3 debuts with its first-ever V-8, generating 414 horses from its 4

liters.



The 6-Series coupe and convertible styling is refreshed for 2008.



Watch this spring for the new subcompact 1-Series coupe, with the same engines

as the 3 and 5. But the rear-wheel-drive 1-Series coupes are expected to be

priced lower than the 3-Series' $33,000-plus.



CADILLAC



The lowest-priced Caddy is big news: Starting just under $33,000, the midsize

CTS sedan is redesigned and re-powered. Its angular styling is softened, and the

interior gets a thorough upgrade that lets it compete with BMW and Audi.



All-wheel-drive is available for the first time, and the top engine is a

3.6-liter V-6 with direct injection that produces 304 hp -- the most ever for a

CTS.



Keep in mind that's in a regular CTS. The second-generation high-performance

CTS-V won't show up until next calendar year with an expected 500 or so horses.

Buyers who want to shift for themselves can get a regular CTS with six-speed

manual. That top V-6 becomes the base engine for the refreshed STS sedan.



The Cadillac Escalade Hybrid arrives as the first luxury full-size hybrid SUV.

It will share its hybrid system with the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon hybrids,

where electric motors supplement the power provided by a V-8 to improve fuel

economy by an estimated 25 percent over a conventional Escalade.



CHEVROLET



Chevrolet's midsize Malibu sedan is bigger inside and out and has a modern new

look for 2008. It's the first Malibu with head-curtain airbags standard on all

trim levels, and new optional features include a 110-volt household-type AC

power outlet and panoramic sunroof.



The Malibu is offered with a 164-hp 2.4-liter four-cylinder. When mated to a

four-speed automatic, this Malibu version is rated at a noteworthy 30 mpg in

highway driving. This is despite new, stricter EPA fuel-economy calculations

that will make it harder for many gas-only cars to reach a 30-mpg rating. One

step up, a hybrid Malibu costs about $1,800 more and is rated at 24/32. The top

Malibu powerplant is a 252-hp 3.6-liter V-6 with a slick six-speed automatic.



Chevy's iconic Corvette sports car is refined a bit, inside and out, and gets

more powerful in 2008, thanks to a larger engine. The new LS3 small-block

6.2-liter V-8 generates 430 horses with the standard exhaust system. With an

optional, two-mode exhaust, the V-8 offers 436 hp and 428 pound-feet of torque.

Top speed climbs to 190 mph, and with a six-speed, paddle-shift automatic

transmission, the '08 Corvette becomes the fastest automatic-equipped Corvette

ever, with 0-to-60-mph capability of 4.3 seconds.



The retro-styled HHR adds a performance SS version in 2008. SS is an old Chevy

insignia that stands for Super Sport, and the HHR SS is powered by the

turbocharged 260-hp 2-liter four that's also found in the Saturn Sky Red Line

and Pontiac Solstice GXP.



But you only get the full 260 horses with the five-speed manual. If you choose

the four-speed automatic, horsepower peaks at 235. Styling includes SS touches

such as mesh grilles, rear spoiler, new rocker panels and sport seats with suede

accents.



Chevy's smallest car, the Aveo, gets back its five-door hatchback, which had

been missing in 2007, and the Cobalt SS and Supercharged SS models are gone.



Chevy's popular full-size SUV, the Tahoe, gets a hybrid version that uses two

electric motors in a two-mode hybrid system to supplement power from the SUV's

6-liter V-8. Also helping fuel efficiency is the fact the V-8 has automatic

cylinder deactivation to allow the engine to use only half its cylinders when

driving conditions allow.



The Equinox SUV adds a new version called the Equinox Sport. It comes with a

264-hp 3.6-liter V-6, 18-inch wheels, tuned exhaust and lowered suspension.



All models of Avalanche, Suburban and Tahoe get standard head-curtain airbags

for the first time.



The Monte Carlo is dropped from the lineup.



BUICK/GMC/PONTIAC



Buick's big news for 2008 -- the Enclave crossover with room for up to eight --

debuted early. Power comes from a



275-hp 3.6-liter V-6; starting at more than $32,700, the Enclave is the priciest

of General Motors' three new crossovers -- the others are the GMC Acadia and

Saturn Outlook.



Buick is down to only three vehicles in the United States for 2008. The other

two -- the Lucerne and LaCrosse sedans -- add new Super trim levels designed to

make the cars look and feel more sporty. The LaCrosse Super, for example, has a

bolder grille than a regular LaCrosse, newly fashioned hood and a 300-hp

5.3-liter small-block V-8.



The Lucerne Super has a new grille plus a 292-hp 4.6-liter Northstar V-8.



GMC debuts its first hybrid SUV. The Yukon Hybrid is a full-service, large SUV

with a towing capacity of more than 6,000 pounds. Yet, with its 6-liter Vortec

V-8 supplemented by onboard electric power, the Yukon Hybrid provides better

fuel economy than a conventional, gas-only Yukon -- 22/21 for the

rear-wheel-drive model and 20/20 with 4WD, compared with 14/20 and 14/19,

respectively. Also, the heavy-duty Yukon XL 2500 has a new six-speed automatic

transmission.



Pontiac adds performance-oriented GXP trim to the five-passenger Torrent

crossover and G6 coupe and sedan models.



The Torrent GXP wears larger 18-inch wheels, has a sport-tuned suspension and is

powered by a 264-hp 3.6-liter V-6 developing 250 pound-feet of torque. This

compares with the 185 horses and 210 pound-feet in a regular Torrent. Torrent

GXPs are available in front- and all-wheel-drive.



GXP versions of the G6 get unique sporty touches like stylized rocker panels

outside, dual chrome exhaust tips and a 252-hp 3.6-liter V-6 with 251 pound-feet

of torque; GXP replaces the previous GTP trim level.



Meantime, head-curtain airbags become standard equipment on the compact G5, and

the Grand Prix is phased out with the end of the 2007 model year.



But be on the lookout for the new Pontiac G8. It's the first rear-drive

four-passenger Pontiac since the short-lived return of the Australian-bred GTO,

which ended with the 2006 model year.



Like the GTO, the expressively styled G8 will be based on an Australian model,

the Holden Commodore, and will be built Down Under. Choose either a 256-hp

3.6-liter V-6 or 361-hp 6-liter V-8.



Also coming early in the year is the new Vibe, based on the Toyota Matrix.



CHRYSLER/DODGE/JEEP



The biggest news at Chrysler this year isn't necessarily its vehicles -- it's

the company itself. Germany's Daimler, which bought Chrysler in 1998, sold 80

percent of the Michigan-based automaker to the Cerberus private-equity group

last summer for $7.4 billion. Since then, Cerberus has been busy installing new

executives, advisers and board of directors.



Meanwhile in showrooms, the company's new fifth-generation minivans -- Chrysler

Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan -- gain a roomy, quieter interior for up

to seven passengers; new safety equipment; novel, optional swivel seats; and

even a work/lunch table inside.



Chrysler's Sebring Convertible offers a choice of three tops -- vinyl, fabric

and hardtop -- and three engines, a 173-hp 2.4-liter four, 186-hp 2.7-liter V-6

and 235-hp 3.5-liter V-6.



The Dodge Avenger sedan has distinctive styling "attitude" and the same engines

as Chrysler's Sebring.



The Caliber five-door adds a high-performance SRT4 model with a turbocharged

280-hp 2.4-liter four.



The Dakota pickup gets refreshed styling and -- along with the Ram 1500 pickup,

Durango SUV and Chrysler Aspen SUV -- a new 303-hp 4.7-liter V-8 that runs on

E85.



Jeep's Liberty compact SUV has revamped styling, improved on-road handling and

ride and more safety equipment. New features include a new full-time

four-wheel-drive system; Hill Descent Control for a smoother, controlled descent

down a rough or slippery hillside; and Hill Start Assist, designed to keep a

vehicle from rolling backward when stopped on a hill.



The Jeep Commander, which debuted in 2006 as the first Jeep with three rows of

seats, is available with just two rows of seats in a new-for-2008 Sport R

package.



Air conditioning becomes standard on all models of the Jeep Compass and Patriot

in 2008. It had been an option on base models.



FORD/LINCOLN/MERCURY



Ford's big news is the Sync in-car digital communication system, developed with

Microsoft, which gives drivers hands-free voice control over cell-phone calls

and music players. The restyled Focus was the first model to get Sync, but it

has since started to spread across the lineup. The Focus now has a more modern

ride and new features -- now only in sedan and first-ever coupe versions.



The Escape SUV is updated with bolder styling, more safety equipment, a quieter

ride and a new interior that's believed to be the first in the United States

with seats covered in 100 percent recyclable fabric materials. With

front-wheel-drive, the 2008 Escape Hybrid is EPA rated at 34/30, better than

many small cars.



Ford's top Mustang, the Shelby GT500, adds a limited edition in 2008. Only 1,000

copies of the 2008 GT500KR will be made to commemorate the 40th anniversary of

its namesake, the "King of the Road" GT500 from the late 1960s, this time with

540 horses from its race-tuned 5.4-liter supercharged Triton V-8.



The Taurus sedan returns from the near-dead in its largest form ever -- actually

a rebadged Ford Five Hundred with a 263-hp 3.5-liter V-6, improved sound

insulation and retuned rear suspension. Taurus X wagon used to be the Ford

Freestyle.



Lincoln's full-size Navigator SUV makes several features standard for 2008,

including power rear liftgate, Sirius satellite radio, premium THX II-certified

audio system and heated and cooled seats.



The Mercury Sable, like its well-known sibling, the Ford Taurus, is back in

dealerships for 2008 as a larger sedan with modern styling and more safety

equipment.



Actually, the five-passenger Sable is an updated version of last year's Mercury

Montego. The Montego was launched three years ago to replace the Sable, but it

didn't sell as well as expected, and with the Taurus coming back, the Sable

comes with it.



The Sable uses the same engine found in the Taurus -- a 263-hp 3.5-liter,

Duratec V-6 mated to a six-speed automatic transmission -- and is available with

front- or all-wheel drive.



Mercury's compact Mariner SUV gets new styling inside and out, and a quieter

ride for 2008.



The five-passenger Mariner adds a new, lower-priced version of its hybrid model,

too. Now available with front-wheel drive, the 2008 Mariner Hybrid starts at

$26,620. This compares with $28,615 for a 2007 Mariner Hybrid that was offered

only with four-wheel drive.



The front-drive Mariner Hybrid joins the Escape Hybrid at the top of government

fuel-mileage ratings for SUVs, coming in at 34/30 mpg.



HONDA



The big news at Honda is its largest Accord ever. With more front-seat hiproom

and rear-seat legroom than ever before, the new five-passenger sedan qualifies

as a large car for the first time under EPA guidelines.



Styling looks richer, with a sweeping dashboard design in both the sedan and

coupe; more safety features are offered, including anti-whiplash front-seat head

restraints; and four-cylinder and V-6 engines provide more power than before. In

fact, the Accord's 268-hp 3.5-liter V-6 is the most powerful in any Honda

vehicle, yet it also works to save fuel with a new cylinder-deactivation system

that can run on three, four or all six cylinders to save fuel.



The Odyssey minivan's styling is refreshed, and the V-6 engine's

cylinder-deactivation system is upgraded.



The Civic gets a MUGEN Si Sedan -- with a lowered suspension, forged aluminum

wheels, aero styling package and a sport-tuned exhaust system -- and a leather

package for the first time on both sedans and coupes.



HYUNDAI



The seven-passenger Veracruz crossover debuted earlier this year as Hyundai's

first vehicle with a starting retail price of more than $25,000.



For 2008, a first-ever navigation system from LG is a new Veracruz option.



Also in 2008, the Sonata sedan is offered with 162-hp 2.4-liter four-cylinder

across all trim levels for the first time to allow fuel-conscious buyers to get

all the features and amenities normally reserved for V-6 models. The

four-cylinder Sonata, which the EPA considers a large car, is rated at a

noteworthy 31 mpg in highway travel with the standard five-speed manual

transmission, and 30 mpg on the highway with the optional four-speed automatic

transmission.



Hyundai also reduced the price of its 2008 Sonata GLS with a 234-hp 3.3-liter

V-6 so it's $450 less than last year's lowest-priced Sonata with V-6.



Meantime, the Tucson compact SUV adds front-seat, anti-whiplash head restraints

during the 2008 model year.



INFINITI



Infiniti's latest crossover, the EX35, slots in under the FX. Based on the

superb G35 sedan, the EX35 takes on the BMW X3 and Acura RDX with a 290-hp

3.5-liter V-6 driving either the rear or all four wheels.



The EX is the first vehicle in the United States with an Around View Monitor.

Using strategically placed cameras, this system assembles a view that appears to

be from on high, above the vehicle, showing the ground close to the vehicle.

It's designed to help reduce blind spots when the vehicle is being parked.



The other big news at Infiniti is the G37 Coupe, which comes with a 330-hp

3.7-liter V-6 -- up from 275. Technology is plentiful and includes a

sophisticated Four-Wheel Active Steer system for handling that makes the G37

feel like it can move unconsciously with a driver's thoughts.



On Infiniti's large car, the M, you can now pair all-wheel drive with the larger

V-8 engine, as well as the V-6.



Finally, the full-size Infiniti QX56 SUV is refreshed inside and out.



KIA



Only minor changes for 2008. The company's newest model, the Kia Rondo, debuted

earlier this year as a tall wagon with three rows of seats.



LAND ROVER



The Land Rover LR2 is powered by a 230-hp 3.2-liter six matched to a six-speed

automatic and permanent all-wheel drive. There are plenty of off-road aides:

Land Rover's Terrain Response system tailors the vehicle for off-road

conditions, and Hill Descent Control makes descending steep, slippery slopes a

bit easier.



LEXUS



Lexus started 2008 early with the release of its most technologically advanced

car ever -- a luxurious, limousine-size sedan that combines a hybrid system, V-8

engine and all-wheel drive. The Lexus LS 600h L is a big car with 70 percent

lower emissions than its nearest competitor and best-in-class V-8 fuel mileage

-- all while delivering power approaching that of a 12-cylinder car.



Elsewhere at Lexus, the V-8 in the GS 460 is upgraded to 342 hp, and all GS

models get minor restyling front and back.



Lexus also jumps into the high-performance sedan business with the new IS F

sport sedan. Powered by a 5-liter V-8, this four-door boasts 416 hp and 371

pound-feet of torque. Drivers manage shifts through an eight-speed automatic

with paddle shifters, and the 0-to-60-mph time is 4.6 seconds.



Lastly, the new LX 570 SUV gets the 5.7-liter V-8 from Toyota's Tundra pickup,

which here puts out an astounding 383 horsepower.



MAZDA



Mazda has two new crossovers for 2008: The tortured CX-7 seats five and is

powered by a turbocharged-but-overwhelmed 2.3-liter four that can't help but

guzzle premium unleaded while the sumptuous CX-9 seats seven in relative comfort

and takes naturally to highways, where low gearing creates a refreshingly

laid-back drive.



Powered by a 273-hp 3.7-liter V-6 attached to a seamless six-speed automatic,

the CX-9 was recently named Motor Trend's SUV of the Year.



The Mazdaspeed 6 sedan and 6 wagon are discontinued.



The Mazda5 mini-minivan has freshened styling and a new five-speed automatic

transmission, and adds rear air-cooling vents.



And the iconic MX-5 roadster still has the smartest power hardtop available, one

that neither hugely increases weight nor drastically impacts cargo space.



MERCEDES



A larger fourth-generation C-Class sedan highlights news from Mercedes. With the

choice of a 228-hp 3-liter



V-6 or 268-hp 3.5-liter V-6, the new C-Class can be had with a six-speed manual

or a seven-speed automatic.



A Sport trim level is designed for younger buyers, while Luxury trim is supposed

to appeal to traditional luxury-car purchasers.



Mercedes also powers up many of its other vehicles this year: For example, the

large GL-Class and ML-Class SUVs are offered with a 382-hp 5.5-liter V-8, while

a 518-hp 6.2-liter V-8 is available in the S-Class, CL-Class and CLK-Class.



But the Mercedes R-Class wagon goes the opposite direction, dropping its

V-8-powered R500 and R63 AMG versions and leaving only V-6 models in the lineup.



Mercedes is also one of the only brands selling diesel vehicles in the U.S. for

2008: The E320 BlueTec sedan and GL320, ML320 and R320 CDI SUVs combine

right-now performance with impressive fuel economy.



MINI



The new Mini Clubman has more doors and a longer body than any other Mini.

Specifically, the five-door Clubman is nearly 9.5 inches longer than a

three-door Mini hatchback and provides 9.1 cubic feet of cargo space behind the

two rear seats.



When the Clubman's rear seats are folded down, there's 32.6 cubic feet of cargo

space, 36 percent more than in a Mini hatchback. Legroom is improved, too, by

nearly 3.2 inches.



Passengers can enter the Clubman on the passenger side with ease, thanks to

paired, front-hinged passenger door and rear-hinged rear door. Also, the back of

the Clubman features two split doors.



There are two gasoline engines: a 120-hp 1.6-liter four and a turbocharged

175-hp 1.6-liter four. A diesel engine available in Europe is not planned for

the United States.



Clubman prices start between Mini's hatchback and convertible models: $21,100 or

$3,000 more for the turbocharged S version.



MITSUBISHI



Mitsubishi's 2008 Lancer sedan arrived early as a ninth-generation model with

bolder styling, roomier interior, new front-wheel-drive platform and a 30-hp

boost.



Now with 152 horses coming from a 2-liter four cylinder, the five-passenger

Lancer sedan is one of the few cars to include a driver's knee airbag among its

standard safety features. The knee bag helps keep a driver properly positioned

during a frontal crash.



Fans of the cult Lancer Evolution, though, are still waiting for the newest

version, which features a turbocharged four-cylinder with 291 hp and 300

pound-feet of torque -- plus Mitsubishi's new Super All-Wheel Control all-wheel

drive.



Also for 2008, Mitsubishi adds standard traction and active skid control to all

Endeavor SUVs.



NISSAN



The Nissan Rogue is a five-passenger crossover slightly smaller than the Murano,

which itself is new, but as a 2009. With a 170-hp 2.5-liter four and the choice

of front- or all-wheel-drive, the Rogue is designed to compete against the

class-leading Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.



The sporty-looking Altima Coupe likely will boost total Altima sales to a record

this year. Every body panel is different from the sedan. In fact, the coupe is

shorter in height, wheelbase and overall length, though it uses the sedan's

front-drive platform underneath. The four-passenger coupe also shares the

sedan's engines: a 175-hp 2.5-liter four or 270-hp 3.5-liter V-6.



The Titan full-size pickup adds long-wheelbase models that extend the beds by a

foot and a half. There's also a new Titan Pro-4X off-road grade that includes

Rancho shocks.



The long-running Pathfinder SUV is available for the first time with a V-8 --

the 5.6-liter from the Titan creates the most powerful Pathfinder ever.



SAAB



The Saab 9-3 sedan, SportCombi wagon and convertible are restyled, and the

uplevel turbocharged 2.8-liter V-6 has been massaged to deliver 255 horses, up

from last year's 250.



The special-edition Turbo X of the sedan and wagon will sport a 280-hp version

of that engine when it goes on sale in spring. It's also the first 9-3 to get

Saab's XWD all-wheel-drive system, which will spread to other 9-3 models during

2008.



Another limited-edition model is the Saab 9-7X Aero SUV, which gets GM's 390-hp

LS2 6-liter V-8 while "regular" 9-7X vehicles remain powered by a 285-hp

4.2-liter inline-six or a 300-hp 5.3-liter V-8.



SATURN



Saturn follows up a busy 2007, when its Aura midsize sedan was named North

American Car of the Year, with a revamped, refined and larger Vue. The

five-passenger Vue crossover now has upscale styling, a roomier interior and

three engine choices.



The powerplants include a 169-hp 2.4-liter four cylinder, a 222-hp 3.5-liter V-6

and a 257-hp 3.6-liter V-6. The latter is the most powerful engine ever in a

production Vue. But only the four-cylinder is used in the Vue's Green Line

hybrid version.



A new feature for the Vue is electronic Trailer Sway Control. It's integrated

into the standard StabiliTrak system and can detect when a trailer being towed

behind the Vue is swaying. The system then applies the Vue's brakes on its own,

independent of the driver, to help stabilize the vehicle. If trailer sway

continues, StabiliTrak will reduce engine torque to slow the vehicle further.



Towing capacity for the new Vue, by the way, is 3,500 pounds, and the starting

price has increased nearly $3,300 to more than $21,000.



Going on sale this week to replace the ghastly Ion compact, Saturn's new Astra

three- and five-door hatchbacks come straight from Europe. Astras have been sold

for years by GM's European Opel division, but this is the first time Astras are

coming to the States.



They are powered by a 140-hp 1.8-liter four-cylinder attached to a five-speed

manual transmission with a four-speed automatic optional on all three models --

base XE five-door, XR five-door and XR three-door. Even the XE gets a

tilt/telescoping wheel, ABS, 16-inch wheels, OnStar, six airbags, stability

control and a CD player. The only three-door model comes with 18-inch wheels, a

quicker steering ratio, sportier suspension tuning and a lowered ride height.



The Relay minivan is replaced by the Outlook crossover.



SMART



The Smart ForTwo comes with many standard safety features, including four

airbags, electronic stability control and antilock brakes.



Starting price for a base coupe is $11,590, while the top model -- a cabriolet

with power-operated, fabric top -- will start at $16,590.



SUBARU



On sale for only two model years, the Tribeca crossover already got a makeover

-- losing its snouty face, boosting horsepower to 256 (on regular unleaded) and

updating the rear suspension and automatic transmission for better ride and

performance.



The Impreza is all-new and larger in every dimension but is still available as

either a sedan or five-door hatchback. The base Impreza is



powered by a 170-hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder while the uplevel, sporty



Impreza WRX is powered by a 224-hp turbocharged version of the 2.5-liter engine.

Curtain airbags and stability control are now standard.



The reborn STI is just hitting dealers, and the legend now has a 305-hp engine

and comes only as a hatch.



Lastly, the five-passenger Legacy and Outback are mildly restyled for 2008, and

a new Legacy 3.0 R Limited sedan includes Bilstein sport suspension, 245-hp

six-cylinder engine and 18-inch alloy wheels.



SUZUKI



Suzuki adds a sedan version of the all-wheel-drive SX4 hatchback, powered by the

same 143-hp 2-liter four, but it's front-drive only. The Aerio was dropped at

the end of 2007.



TOYOTA/SCION



Toyota's news for 2008 revolves around its SUVs.



The second-generation Highlander is bigger, heavier, more spacious, quieter and

more powerful this year, and its hybrid version has a first-ever push button on

the dashboard that lets drivers choose to drive the SUV in electric-only mode,

if conditions permit. There's only one engine now for gas-only Highlanders, a

270-hp 3.5-liter V-6. The new Highlander sits on a new chassis derived from the

one in the Camry, so the ride is more refined.



The Highlander Hybrid combines Toyota's latest generation Hybrid Synergy Drive

system with a 3.3-liter V-6 and all-wheel drive. Together, the electric power

and smaller V-6 generate the same peak 270 hp as the larger V-6 but is EPA rated

at 27/25.



Also new are larger, more-powerful editions of the legendary Land Cruiser and

gargantuan Sequoia SUVs. The Land Cruiser returns for its seventh generation

dripping with the kinds of luxury features and off-road gadgetry that Land

Cruisers have traditionally done just fine without. The Sequoia is the

three-row, Suburban-sized SUV version of the Tundra pickup. Environmentalists

denounced its launch at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November.



Meanwhile, Toyota is reducing the price of its Camry Hybrid by $1,000, and the

Avalon is mildly restyled.



Scion's smallest car, the xA, is replaced by a larger five-door with a new name.

The xD rides on a new front-wheel-drive platform and has a more powerful

four-cylinder engine, added safety equipment, bigger wheels and more standard

features. Specifically, the xD's 1.8-liter four cylinder develops 128 horses

compared with the 103 from the xA's 1.5-liter four. New standard features

include cruise control, curtain airbags and seat-mounted side airbags.



The xB gets new looks and more power, too. But it retains its name and boxy

shape, though corners are softened and there are now wraparound headlights,

larger 16-inch wheels and pronounced fenders. With seats for five and a

noteworthy 21.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, the xB is sold

with oodles of accessories for customizing buyers.



Power comes from a 2.4-liter four that develops 55 more hp than its predecessor

-- to 158 horses. Five-speed manual and four-speed automatic transmissions are

available.



Lastly, the tC coupe gets mildly restyled in front and back this year.



VOLKSWAGEN



The Touareg SUV becomes the Touareg 2 with subtle styling updates, and some

equipment, such as power liftgate and Electronic Parking Assistance, becomes

standard. Seats and side bolsters also are changed for improved comfort.



The Rabbit and Jetta get more power from a 2.5-liter five-cylinder that's been

retuned to 170 hp, up from 150.



The Jetta loses its turbocharged 2-liter four in 2008, but a new clean diesel

powerplant is on the way, likely arriving closer to summer.



Also expect a new SportWagen version of Jetta early in the year.



VOLVO



The new C30, a three-door hatchback built off the S40 sedan platform, is Volvo's

lowest-priced model, starting at $23,445 with a manual transmission.



The C30 is powered by a turbocharged 227-hp 2.5-liter five-cylinder and is

available in front-wheel drive. Only 8,000 annual sales are expected in the

United States.



The V70 and XC70 station wagons are revised this year with their first naturally

aspirated -- not turbocharged -- powerplant; specifically, the cars get 235

horses from a new 3.2-liter inline-six mated to a six-speed automatic

transmission.



The all-wheel-drive system in the XC70 is supplemented with new Hill Descent

Control for more steady, controlled descents on slippery, rough hillsides.



Meantime, the S80 sedan adds a performance model -- the S80 T6 AWD. It's powered

by a twin-turbocharged 285-hp 3-liter inline-six.
