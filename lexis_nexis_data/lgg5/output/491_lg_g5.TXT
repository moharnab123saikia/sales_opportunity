world online, the social network has said.

Following on from a surprise appearance at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
where company chief Mark Zuckerberg described virtual reality as the future,
Facebook has spoken of its desire to map the world and identify areas of human
activity lacking in connectivity.

The social network is already involved in a solar-powered drone project which
aims to beam internet signals down to remote parts of the world. This new
mapping system could be used in conjunction with the drones.

In a blog post discussing the idea, Facebook's Tobias Tiecke explained that the
firm was using satellite imagery to map where human activity is, with a computer
able to spot and log where man-made buildings are.

"Ten percent of the world's population lives in areas of the world where
connectivity is simply not available; connecting these often remote and rural
areas will require the development of new wireless communication technologies
and platforms," he said.

On stage at Samsung's event, Mr Zuckerberg called virtual reality technology
"the next platform", and explained his belief that VR headsets will become the
social hubs of the future, with users gathering around them in order to connect
to friends around the world.

"Imagine holding a group meeting or event anywhere that you want," he said.

"All these things are going to be possible, and that's why Facebook is investing
so much early on in virtual reality. So we can help to deliver these kind of
social experiences."

Samsung and LG are among the technology giants to announce 360-degree cameras at
Mobile World Congress, devices which can be used to create virtual reality
video. LG has also been showing a virtual reality headset the connects directly
to its latest smartphone, the G5.
