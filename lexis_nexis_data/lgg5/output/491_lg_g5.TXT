Facebook wants to use artificial intelligence to help bring remote parts of the

world online, the social network has said.



Following on from a surprise appearance at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona

where company chief Mark Zuckerberg described virtual reality as the future,

Facebook has spoken of its desire to map the world and identify areas of human

activity lacking in connectivity.



The social network is already involved in a solar-powered drone project which

aims to beam internet signals down to remote parts of the world. This new

mapping system could be used in conjunction with the drones.



In a blog post discussing the idea, Facebook's Tobias Tiecke explained that the

firm was using satellite imagery to map where human activity is, with a computer

able to spot and log where man-made buildings are.



"Ten percent of the world's population lives in areas of the world where

connectivity is simply not available; connecting these often remote and rural

areas will require the development of new wireless communication technologies

and platforms," he said.



On stage at Samsung's event, Mr Zuckerberg called virtual reality technology

"the next platform", and explained his belief that VR headsets will become the

social hubs of the future, with users gathering around them in order to connect

to friends around the world.



"Imagine holding a group meeting or event anywhere that you want," he said.



"All these things are going to be possible, and that's why Facebook is investing

so much early on in virtual reality. So we can help to deliver these kind of

social experiences."



Samsung and LG are among the technology giants to announce 360-degree cameras at

Mobile World Congress, devices which can be used to create virtual reality

video. LG has also been showing a virtual reality headset the connects directly

to its latest smartphone, the G5.
