LG G5 rumors so far kept pointing to an earlier than normal release date, and

since the company's MWC 2016 invitees are out, can the rumors be true?



LG recently started sending out vague invites today, inviting members of the

media to an event scheduled on February 21st. It simply states "Play Begins"

with a mysterious jack-in-the-box music player in the background. There is no

official confirmation that the LG G5 would be announced next month, but last

year the Samsung Galaxy S6 and HTC One M9 did get a jumpstart of the LG G4, so

LG might not want to repeat that. The invite does not mention what the music box

or "Play Begins" refers to either, but it could mean a new flagship device with

front facing speakers.



Rumored secs of the LG G5 include a Snapdragon 820 processor running onÂ Android

Marshmallow. It will come with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage,

according to the latest LG G5 rumors. Other specs include a display ranging

between 5.3 to 5.6 inches, depending on who you ask. It'll likely be quad HD (or

2K) again, but it there are possibilities for a rare 4K phone display. LG's

already impressive camera could get even better with faster performance and the

chance that it'll inherit the 120-degree wide LG V10's dual selfie camera, a

feature should really be in all phones.



The event will be held in Barcelona.
