   Ask Siri to name the most successful company in the world and it might

respond: Apple. In terms of profit, revenue, market capitalization, and consumer

cachet, it certainly ranks right up there. The iPhone, in its ninth year and

seventh generation, has been the company's golden goose, generating two thirds

of the company's revenue. Other familiar Apple products -- MacBook computers and

iPad tablets &ndash; each account for about 10% of sales. Services such as

iTunes, the App store, and Apple Music add another tenth or so. Mostly a

consumer-oriented company, Apple has inked alliances with IBM and Cisco Systems

to deepen its penetration of the enterprise market. About 60% of revenue comes

from overseas.



   Operations



   Apple's mobile products, the iPhone and iPad, account for about

three-quarters of its revenue. The iPad line has been expanded to include the

iPad Pro, which features a bigger screen and a more powerful processes; it's

aimed at the business market. The computer line includes the iMac desktop line

and the MacBook laptop line.



   Apple's product run on two operating systems. The mobile products are on iOS,

now in its 10th generation, and the computers run on OS X. The company generally

updates its operating systems once a year.



   The company also makes the Apple Watch, which is part of its Other Products

segment (4% of sales). Other products are Beats headphones, which the company

acquired in 2014, the Apple Pay payment system, Apple Music, Apple TV, and

iCloud.



   The App store is where applications from Apple and third parties are

accessed. Over eight years, more than 140 billion apps have been downloaded.



   The company makes some of its products at facilities in Ireland and the US,

but most manufacturing is handled by third party contractors such as Foxconn,

also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, operating in Asia.



   Geographic Reach



   The Americas market, which includes the US, accounts for 40% of the company's

sales. About a quarter of sales come from China while European customers

generate 22% of revenue.



   Sales and Marketing



   Apple sells through its own 420 or so retail stores and website and through

other retailers. About 22% of revenue comes through its stores. The iPhones are

also sold through carriers such as Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile.



   Financial Performance



   Over the past decade Apple has been on a remarkable run of increasing revenue

and profit. In 2015 (ended September), revenue increased 28% to $233.7 billion

while profit jumped about 35% to $53.4 billion, compared to 2014. Its profit

margin was about 23% in 2015.



   iPhone sales increased 52% in 2015 (adding $53 billion to the top line) with

the introduction of the larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Sales for the iPad

dropped 23% in 2015 from 2015. China led geographic markets with an 84% increase

in 2015, doubling the year's increased sales in the Americas. The strength of

the US dollar in relation to other currencies tugged at revenue.



   Apple's net income jumped 35% to $53.4 billion from to $39.5 billion in 2014

on the higher sales. The company reported higher selling, general, and

administrative expense, and higher spending on marketing and advertising.



   Cash generated by operations rose to $81 billion in 2015 from $60 billion in

2014.



   Strategy



   Following its customary practice, Apple introduced the latest model iPhones

toward the end of its fourth quarter, priming them to benefit from holiday sales

in what is the first quarter of its fiscal year. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus

debuted to positive comments from reviewers as they went on sale. Whether

they'll maintain blockbuster sales as previous models have done remained to be

seen.



   The company reported lower phone sales in the second and third quarter of

2015 (ended September), the first such quarters in the iPhone's history. Other

companies, notably Samsung, have caught up (and in some features, surpassed)

Apple's technologies and design. Apple has disappointed some analysts by failing

to deliver a new breakthrough product. The Apple Watch has produced block buster

sales, though Apple has said it sales are in line with its expectations. Nor

have services like Apple Pay or Apple Music provided noticeable boosts to

revenue.



   While China provided a big injection of revenue in 2015, Apple faces

increasing competition there and elsewhere. The company has spent time wooing

officials in India in hopes that it can break into that market. In 2016, Apple

opened an office in Hyderabad that will focus on development of Maps for Apple

products.



   In some ways Apple's strengths can be seen as weaknesses. The tight

interlocking of software and hardware helps its devices work, but it frustrates

users who would like to have access to more third party products including

hardware. The company's history of innovation has led analysts and customers to

expect big products from Apple on a regular basis. They're disappointed when it

fails to deliver.



   Apple became ensnarled in debates over national security and privacy in 2016

when it refused to help the FBI get access to information on a terrorist's

iPhone. The issue was resolved when authorities got the information without

Apple's help. In another regulatory battle, the European Union officials ruled

that Apple owed some $14 billion in back taxes to Ireland. Apple said it would

fight the ruling, but the issue is indicative of Europe's stronger stance

against American technology companies.





HISTORY:



   Company Background



   College dropouts Steve Jobs (1955-2011) and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in

1976 in California's Santa Clara Valley. After Jobs' first sales call brought an

order for 50 units, the duo built the Apple I in his garage and sold it without

a monitor, keyboard, or casing. Demand convinced Jobs there was a distinct

market for small computers, and the company's name (a reference to Jobs' stint

on an Oregon farm) and the computer's user-friendly look and feel set it apart

from others.



   By 1977 Wozniak added a keyboard, color monitor, and eight peripheral device

slots (which gave the machine considerable versatility and inspired numerous

third-party add-on devices and software). Sales jumped from $7.8 million in 1978

to $117 million in 1980, the year Apple went public. In 1983 Wozniak left the

firm and Jobs hired PepsiCo's John Sculley as president. Apple rebounded from

failed product introductions that year by unveiling the Macintosh in 1984. After

tumultuous struggles with Sculley, Jobs left in 1985 and founded NeXT, a

designer of applications for developing software. That year Sculley ignored

Microsoft founder Bill Gates' appeal for Apple to license its products and make

the Microsoft platform an industry standard.



   Apple blazed the desktop publishing trail in 1986 with its Mac Plus and

LaserWriter printers. The following year it formed the software firm that later

became Claris (and ultimately FileMaker). The late 1980s brought new competition

from Microsoft, whose Windows operating system (OS) featured a graphical

interface akin to Apple's. Apple sued but lost its claim to copyright protection

in 1992.



   In 1993 Apple unveiled the Newton handheld computer, but sales were slow.

Earnings fell drastically, so the company trimmed its workforce. (Sculley was

among the departed.) In 1994 Apple cried "uncle" and began licensing clones of

its OS, hoping a flurry of cheaper Mac-alikes would encourage software

developers. By 1996 struggling Apple realized Mac clones were stealing sales.

That year it hired Gilbert Amelio, formerly of National Semiconductor, as CEO.



   The company bought NeXT in 1997, but sales kept dropping and it subsequently

cut about 30% of its workforce, canceled projects, and trimmed research costs.

Meanwhile Apple's board ousted Amelio and Jobs took the position back on an

interim basis. The CEO forged a surprising alliance with Microsoft, which

included releasing a Mac version of Microsoft's popular office software. To

protect market share, Jobs also stripped the cloning license from chief imitator

Power Computing and put it out of business.



   In 1998 Apple jumped back into the race with its colorful cocktail of iMacs,

and its first server software, the Mac OS X. That year the company also revamped

its profitable Claris unit (by cutting 300 employees, shifting most operations

to Apple, and renaming it FileMaker) and stopped making its Newton handheld

device and printer products.



   Apple in 1999 opened a new chapter in portable computing with the

introduction of its iBook laptop and (taking a cue from Dell) began selling

built-to-order systems online. In 2000, after two and a half years as the

semipermanent executive in charge, Jobs took the "interim" out of his title, and

revamped the company's Web site around a suite of consumer Internet services.

Jobs unveiled overhauled desktop lines later that year, including an eight-inch

cube-shaped G4. The company ended 2000 on a sour note, as an industrywide

slowdown and poor response to the G4 cube resulted in Apple's first unprofitable

quarter in years.



   Apple opened 2001 with another round of product upgrades, including faster

processors, components such as CD and DVD burners, and an ultraslim version of

its PowerBook, called Titanium. The company also made a move to reclaim some of

its slipping share in the education market, purchasing software maker

PowerSchool. Soon Apple confirmed a long-rumored plan to open a chain of retail

stores in the US. The company then acquired DVD authoring software maker Spruce

Technologies. In line with its strategy to market Macs as "digital hubs" for

devices such as cameras and other peripherals, Apple closed the year with the

introduction of a digital music player called the iPod.



   In 2002 Apple introduced a new look for its iMac line; featuring a half-dome

base and a flat-panel display supported by a pivoting arm, the redesign was the

first departure from the original (and, at the time, radical) all-in-one design

since iMac's debut in 1998. Looking to reclaim market share in the education

sector, Apple then introduced the eMac -- a computer similar to the iMac to be

sold only to students and educators (Apple later introduced a retail version).

It continued its product push that year with the announcement that it would

begin offering a rack-mount server called Xserve. In 2004, Apple debuted a

streamlined iMac design powered by its G5 processor.



   Apple announced it would begin incorporating Intel processors into its PC

lines in 2005, ending more than a decade of using PowerPC microprocessors; the

transition was completed the following year. Also that year, Apple, Motorola,

and Cingular Wireless (now AT&T Mobility) announced the debut of a mobile phone

with iTunes functionality. Apple also unveiled the iPod nano, an updated (and

even smaller) version of its miniature iPod model, as well as an iPod capable of

playing video. In 2006 Apple reached a settlement in a dispute with Creative

Technology over technology used in digital music players; Apple agreed to pay

the company $100 million in exchange for a license to use Creative's patent

related to navigation and organization.



   The company also launched an online movie service in 2006, and previewed a

device called iTV for watching downloaded content on televisions. (Apple

announced availability of its television device, redubbed Apple TV, early the

following year. )



   Apple unveiled a mobile phone offering called the iPhone in 2007. To reflect

the growing breadth of its product portfolio, the company announced it would

change its name from Apple Computer to simply Apple. The company kicked off 2008

with the release of an updated Apple TV device in conjunction with an iTunes

movie rental service.



   Looking toward the continued development of its mobile devices, Apple

purchased P.A. Semi, a developer of low-power processors, in 2008. In another

move intended to bring more of its chip design in-house, Apple bought

Intrinsity, a provider of chip design software, in 2010.



   After beginning 2011 with a leave of absence and then stepping down as CEO,

Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011. COO Tim Cook had been named CEO after Jobs'

resignation, though Jobs retained the chairman title until his death.
