HIGHLIGHT: Virtual reality headsets led the charge in the maelstrom of new

gadgets to expand phones' capabilities at the Mobile World Congress 2016.





As the Mobile World Congress 2016, draws to a close in Barcelona, one thing is

for certain: the days of the smartphone being the be-all and end-all are over.

We're now in the second coming of the accessory, with virtual reality (VR)

headsets leading the charge.Samsung, LG, Sony, Xiaomi, HP, Alcatel and others

all lined up to announce their latest smartphones, some garnering interest,

others less so. But although the shiny new smartphones were plentiful, they were

dwarfed by the volume of add-ons.The mainstay of accessories used to be your

typical cases, serving as protection for that phone you might have just spent

Â£500 or more on. They came in all colours, with clips, bungee cords, screen

protectors and flip-out pads.



Remember the days when Nokia's Xpress-on shells were all the rage for the

3310?Want a slide-out keyboard protector like the Matrix phone? No problem. Want

to make your phone a gaudy heap of gold-coloured plastic? You got it.Though

plastic adornments from third-party manufacturers are undoubtedly still numerous

today, smartphone-makers have switched focus to value-adding devices or grander

gadgets that plug into the smartphone to extend its capabilities.Rory O'Neill,

head of brand marketing for Samsung, says: "The smartphone market in the United

Kingdom has hit saturation point. It's still changing faster than other

electronics categories, but now we have to do more than just a smartphone. We

have to redefine what a phone can do and reach out with a broader

ecosystem."Virtual reality and 360Â° content lead

Judging by the volume of accessories, smartphone-makers have decided that this

"broader ecosystem" should be hung on virtual reality and 360Â° content.Almost

every smartphone launched at Mobile World Congress included either a 360Â°

camera to go with it or a virtual reality headset.Samsung launched the Gear 360

ball camera, LG the 360 Cam and Sony had a concept Xperia Eye 360Â° camera, all

of which are controlled or interacted with through their respective new

smartphones.At the same time, even more companies launched VR headsets in one

form or another. Samsung updated its Gear VR accessory made in partnership with

Facebook's Oculus for the Galaxy S7, including a visit from the social network's

chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to a conference hall full of Gear VR-wearing

attendees - it looked like some sort of sci-fi film, where a leader strode

through legions of unaware humans jacked into a virtual world.LG also joined the

VR world with a headset that, unlike most others, wasn't just a holder for your

smartphone to slot into, but rather plugged into the company's new G5 smartphone

for processing power. It looked more like Geordi La Forge's visor from Star Trek

than the others. Whether that's a good thing remains to be seen.Even budget

smartphone-makers such as Alcatel jumped on the bandwagon by turning their

smartphone packaging into a Google Cardboard-like smartphone case you hold to

your face.The outlier here is HTC with its Vive headset that, rather than being

an accessory to your phone, has phone functions built in, but still requires a

PC to power it.Accessories weren't limited to VR, of course. LG launched a

robotic ball with cameras, an IR blaster for controlling your TV or other

equipment and a laser pointer, which could entertain your cat, perhaps?Even HP,

which launched a Windows 10 smartphone, also launched a range of accessories as

the device's main selling point, including a dock to turn it into a pseudo-PC

with monitor, mouse and keyboard, and a "Mobile Extender" to turns it into a

laptop.Building brand loyalty

But why are smartphone-makers so keen on accessories? There are several likely

reasons, the first being simply more things to sell that don't necessarily have

the same minimal margins that smartphones do.That's not only beneficial to the

manufacturers, but also to the retailers hawking the manufacturer's wares as it

gives them more incentive to give a particular smartphone a solid showing

in-store and online. In days gone by, electronics retailers barely made any

money selling TVs at Â£1 000 and more, and only really generated any profit on

the cables that they sold you with your television - those they would buy for

50p and sell for Â£10.In a world dominated by Android, which allows users to

switch between different smartphone brands with ease, one of the only ways to

keep brand loyalty is to offer something exclusive to your brand.A Samsung Gear

VR will only work with a Samsung smartphone, which means, when you've sunk Â£80

or more into an accessory, it acts as an incentive to stick with a Samsung

smartphone when you upgrade. That is true when consumers buy their phones

subsidised with mobile phone contracts, which disguise the true cost of a

smartphone and makes the cost of the accessory appear disproportionately high,

when in fact it's likely only one-fifth or less of the cost of a high-end

smartphone.Outside the world of Android, where transferring your apps from one

manufacturer to another is practically impossible, the need for accessories is

lessened.The apps and media you buy lock you into your smartphone operating

system, and if only one manufacturer such as Apple makes phones with that

operating system, you're stuck.But for the majority of the rest of the

smartphone world in developed and saturated markets such as the UK, the United

States and parts of Europe, the hard sell on add-ons and "ecosystem" starts

now.Welcome to the second coming of the smartphone accessory. - © Guardian News
