LG G5 and HTC 10 do not satisfy USB Type-C specification, according to an

engineer



LENGTH: 373  words





One engineer believes that LG G5 and HTC 10 should not be purchased because they

do not comply with USB Type-C regulations



Despite the fact that both LG G5 and HTC 10 are very impressive Android phones

in their own separate leagues, one engineer is not too optimistic of using both

phones thanks to the USB Type-C specification. This is because not only do both

devices support Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 (thanks to featuring a Snapdragon

820 SoC), but also because both smartphones feature the unique charging port,

which obviously presents a great deal of a problem.



According to the Googler, neither HTC 10 nor the LG G5 can be considered USB

Type-C spec compliant due to the inclusion of Quick Charge 3.0. Now why is this

so important? According to the person on his Google Plus account: He states

that:



"This is not a legacy cable. This time, I'm reviewing Black Squid's

Full-Featured C-to-C cable! tl;dr: Good cable! Charges at up to 60W, connect

your laptop to your USB 3.1 devices, drive a 4K display...All using 1 cable!

This is the first C-to-C cable I have reviewed, and it's one that does A LOT of

different functions. Excuse the length of this review. I tested with 3 different

chargers, one of them actually an external display dock with a 4K screen. The

cable allowed the Pixel 2 to charge itself, while displaying 4K 60hz video out

and accessing the USB hub on the monitor over a single cable. Woot! For more

information about the difference between USB 2.0 C-to-C and Full Featured C-to-C
