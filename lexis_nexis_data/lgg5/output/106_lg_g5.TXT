LG Electronics has started upgrading its flagship smartphone G5 with Nougat,

Google's latest Android 7.0 mobile operating system (OS), the Korean electronics

giant said Tuesday.



With Google's reference smartphone Nexus series excluded, the G5 became the

first Android smartphone to receive the Nougat upgrade.



'We could provide a well-prepared upgrade service as we have actively received

customer opinions through a preview program,' LG Electronics Senior Vice

President Kim Hyung-jeong said. 'We will continue to promptly provide

after-sales services that customers need in the future.'



The handset maker released a beta version of the Nougat OS in August and

provided the latest mobile OS to 2,000 G5 users in Korea. In the process, the

company has received complaints and suggestions from testers and reflected their

opinions in the upgrade.



The Nougat OS includes new features such as an integrated application search

called 'In-Apps' and a multi-window function.



G5 users can download a dedicated program called LG Bridge from the company's

website or from the download center in the smartphone, to connect the handset to

the company and upgrade it.
