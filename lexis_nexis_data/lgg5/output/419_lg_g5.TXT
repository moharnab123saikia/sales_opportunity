

Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi on Thursday announced the launch of its flagship
model Mi 5 in India to be sold at R24,999, nearly a month after the phone was
first unveiled in China and at the MWC (Mobile World Congress) in Barcelona.

Mi 5 is Xiaomi's most expensive smartphone launched in India ever. The company's
earlier model Mi 4 had a price tag of R19,999. Xiaomi has decided to sell the
new phone through its own e-commerce platform Mi.com for the first four weeks.

Xiaomi, which entered India after having a tie-up with Flipkart in 2014, also
plans to target offline retail in the country this year.

With the launch of Mi 5 having the latest Qualcom Snapdragon 820 processor,
Xiaomi has beaten top players like Samsung and LG. Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 edge
series in India comes with its own Exynos chipsets, while LG is yet to launch
its G5 with the latest processor.
