Shaulov said six months of work to reverse engineer Qualcomm's code revealed the

problems.



The flaws were found in software that handles graphics and in code that controls

communication between different processes running inside a phone.



Exploiting the bugs would allow an attacker to gradually be able to take more

control over a device and gain access to its data.



Checkpoint handed information about the bugs and proof of concept code to

Qualcomm earlier this year.



In response, Qualcomm is believed to have created patches for the bugs and

started to use the fixed versions in its factories.



It also distributed the patches to phone makers and operators. However, it is

not clear how many of those companies have issued updates to customers' phones.



Checkpoint has created a free app called QuadRooter Scanner that can be used to

check if a phone is vulnerable to any of the bugs, by looking to see if the

patches for them have been downloaded and installed.



In addition, Shaulov said Android owners should only download apps from the

official Google Play store to avoid falling victim to malicious programs.



"People should call whoever sold them their phone, their operator or the

manufacturer, and beg them for the patches," said Shaulov.



Qualcomm has yet to respond to a request for comment, according to news

agencies.
