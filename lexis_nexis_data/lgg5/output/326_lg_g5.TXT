LENGTH: 165 words





[THE INVESTOR] LG Electronics' upcoming new smartphone V20 will get a big boost

as Bang & Olufsen is coming on board to add premium audio capabilities to the

phone.



The V20, succeeding the V10, will be the first smartphone to employ 32-bit Quad

DAC, or Digital to Analogue Converter, audio chips that the company said

delivers "a crisp and clear sound that comes closest to a live performance,"

with 50 percent reduction in ambient noise.



This is the second collaboration between LG and B&O Play, the fastest-growing

unit of the Swedish luxury audio company that concentrates on portable audio.



The two firms jointly developed the LG Hifi Plus, an accessory DAC module to

upgrade audio functions of the LG G5, the world's first modular smartphone.



LG said they are also developing premium headsets bundled with the V20.



The V20, the first smartphone featuring Nougat, the latest version of Google's

Android operating system, will make its global debut Sept. 7 in New York and

Seoul.
