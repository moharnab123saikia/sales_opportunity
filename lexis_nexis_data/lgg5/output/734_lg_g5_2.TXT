City, night life is hopping

If Chairman Mao Zedong, in the giant portrait that dominates Tiananmen, the Gate

of Heavenly Peace, were just able to sneak a little glance to his left, he could

almost see the turning that takes you to Tiandi Yijia.



The stylish restaurant, which combines minimalist designs with a discreet hint

of wealth, reflects some of the changes in China in a similar way to the sleek

automobiles that are successors to the clunky Hongqi stretch limos that were

symbols of power in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution.



In those days, ordinary people considered themselves lucky if they had a Flying

Pigeon bicycle. Now, they crowd the road in cars or hop into a taxi. While few

of the drivers speak English, they are happy to carry foreigners with addresses

written in Chinese and they don't expect tips.



Tiandi -- the name means Heaven and Earth -- is a few minutes' walk from the

Forbidden City, and it's a good option if you are sightseeing, especially as

it's no tourist venue. Most of the customers are Chinese and the waitresses

aren't fluent in English. It occupies a beautiful courtyard house, where

spotlights may pick out ancient paintings or modern tableware.



The food is as modern and eclectic as the look, by the designer Yu Qing Shan.

There are dishes from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, with fresh flavours and

lighter sauces than you might expect in north China. Judging by the limousines

outside and the 14 discreet private rooms, it's a place for plutocrats.



In the main dining room of Yellow Parasols, about 50 yellow parasols crowd the

ceiling and there is a grand central table surrounded by a little lake of its

own. Putting aside the indignity of dining alone in China, I sat close to a

couple where the man spent most of the evening on the phone.



The menu features the usual luxury Chinese options such as abalone and bird's

nest, but it's the attention to detail in simple dishes such as Jiaozi (pork

dumplings) that is impressive. These are delicately flavoured and nicely

presented for a Beijing staple. More exotically, a starter of goose liver has

plenty of flavour and finesse. The cold meat is served atop a bed of crunchy

beans sprinkled with sake. This costs 68 yuan ($9.73), which is expensive for

China yet would be a steal back in Europe.



Each dish is prepared and presented with care: The sauces are not as heavy as

you might expect, yet there is no loss of authenticity. Indeed, the lightness of

the cooking brings out the flavours. This is some of the best food I have tried

in Beijing. The only part of the formula I'd want to change is the lighting,

which lacks warmth.



If Tiandi came as a very pleasant surprise, the popular Lan Club was a crashing

disappointment. This Philippe



Starck-designed bar-restaurant "celebrates Chinese and Western cuisine and pairs

it masterfully with wines from around the world." If I may translate that: You

pay through the nose for everyday wines and indifferent food. I should have been

suspicious when I spotted mission statements from no fewer than three chefs on

the menu.



They'd have been amusing to quote, only a surly supervisor first told me I

couldn't have a copy of the menu and then told me to stop making notes from it.



At Fatty Meat, luckily, I did manage to make a note of one dish. Sauteed

Australian beef with black peppers came with two onion rings and a sauce that

might have been at home in the Cafe de Coral fast-food chain in Hong Kong. The

meat was fatty and lukewarm and there wasn't much of it. The cost? It was 680

yuan. When I heard this, I asked if they hadn't added a zero by mistake. A cod

dish was so dried out and overcooked, it was barely recognizable as fish. The

bill for three came to more than 3,000 yuan, or $429.



For all that, Lan can be a fun place to go drinking, as I found a couple of

nights later when I visited with a couple of dot-com entrepreneurs I had run

into in my hotel bar. The designs are beyond fabulous, especially the washrooms,

where the cubicles are luxuriously furnished, each the size of my living room.



We ended that night at Mix, a hip-hop club in the grounds of the Workers'

Stadium, and Vics, a dance club next door. Both were loud, crowded and a lot of

fun. Beijing's nightlife is hopping.
