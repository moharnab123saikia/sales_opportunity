OnePlus 3 does not have an official release date, but we do know that it will

sport 6GB of RAM, and that is a ton of memory in a smartphone



OnePlus has developed a liking for releasing more than one flagship model, and

this approach was taken with the company's OnePlus 2. Now, it appears that the

same business model is going to be used in releasing OnePlus 3, which is the

name expected to be present on the company's next flagship phone. According to

the latest images leak, OnePlus 3 is going to sport 6GB of RAM, and just to

break it down for you, flagship phones like Galaxy S7 and several others still

feature 4GB of RAM, so looking at a Chinese company releasing something like

this will definitely give us goosebumps and get us excited too.



Since all OnePlus smartphones released till now have featured a Qualcomm

chipset, the hardware sheet shows no difference in that trend because OnePlus 3

will most definitely be running a Snapdragon 820. According to The Next Rex,

phones like Xiaomi Mi5 feature a Kryo processor running at different speeds and

as you move up the price bracket, that processor is running at full speeds. We

believe that OnePlus 3 is going to follow the same approach and while most

consumers will not feel a tingle of a performance when it comes to their own

personal experience, there are those who want the best possible scores from

benchmarking applications.



However, having 6GB of RAM might be useful for a variety of different

applications, it will also be a battery guzzler, so we sincerely hope that

OnePlus has kept this drawback in mind and have made a list of plans to counter

it, and we hope that on the top of their list will be a huge battery capacity.

While no pricing details have been made available at this point, OnePlus 3 will

definitely be an affordable product in comparison to the likes of Galaxy S7, LG

G5 and HTC 10.



Unfortunately, we neither know when it is officially going to be announced, but

we should be looking at the third quarter of this year. Who knows, perhaps

OnePlus might even release a less performing model later down the road as it did

with its OnePlus X.
