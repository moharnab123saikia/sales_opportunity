Phones and social media will deliver virtual reality technology to the masses,

writes Hannah Francis.



Barcelona: No matter where you turned your head at the epic Mobile World

Congress this week, there seemed to be somebody lolling theirs around in a

virtual reality headset.



Samsung had a pop-up VR theatre smack bang in the middle of town at Placa de

Catalunya - opposite the Apple store. Members of the public could wait to board

a virtual roller coaster ride as the seats rocked from side to side for a fully

immersive experience.



For a conference that has traditionally been about mobile networks and phones,

virtual reality had stolen the show.



It's phones of course, that will deliver virtual reality technology to the

masses, pushing it beyond the realms of technology enthusiasts and gamers.



Phones, and social media too, according to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.



Facebook, which owns virtual reality company Oculus, is ramping up its

investment in the technology - and its interest in bring VR to its network.



Zuckerberg says VR will be "the most social platform", and that its uptake will

be driven by consumers themselves as they swap still selfies for immersive

video. "I think about my baby daughter and the way I want to remember her when

she takes her first steps," Zuckerberg told a rapt audience during a Samsung

press event. "I want to capture the whole scene ... That way, even if my parents

and my family aren't there to experience it in person, they can feel like

they're right there with us."



360-degree video viewing - which can be experienced on a normal screen by

clicking and dragging video around in its frame, or as a fully immersive

experience through a VR headset - has been available on Facebook since last

year, as it has on YouTube.



With social platforms now backing the trend, the tools to create, share and view

VR content will increasingly be in the hands of consumers in coming months.



VR headsets and 360-degree cameras are quickly becoming the must-have accessory

for new release mobiles. Samsung unveiled its Gear 360 camera, which captures

both video and stills. Footage can be both stitched together and shared to

social platforms right from a smartphone app.



Samsung is also giving away its Gear VR headsets for free with every pre-order

of its new Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge phones, available in coming weeks.



LG meanwhile unveiled its 360 VR goggles and camera - alongside a slew of other

accessories - to go with its latest G5 phone. Sony had a 360-degree camera as

well.



And the packaging of Alcatel's Idol 4s phone - also unveiled at the Congress -

doubles as a VR viewer.



There are dozens more 360-degree cameras aimed at consumers that are coming on

to the market. "One day soon all of us are going to have the power to broadcast

live so all of our friends and family can experience it like they're right there

with us," Zuckerberg said.



Forrester Research analyst Julie Ask believes Zuckerberg's vision of where VR

will take social media is compelling, calling the combination "the killer app".

Hardware manufacturers like Samsung, meanwhile, may increasingly need to rely on

these types of partnerships to sell their devices, she said.



Other analysts are much more sceptical that the VR fad will take off in a big

way, with a lack of compelling content continuing to be a barrier - at least in

the short term.



But while user-generated VR may be in its infancy, professionally produced VR

content is ramping up too. Nokia had its new OZO 360 video camera on display in

Barcelona. It will retail for a cool $US60,000 ($83,000).



The OZO sports eight lenses and microphones for high-definition video and

surround sound capture.



What's new with this technology is the OZO can stream what it captures live to

audiences, opening up the potential for broadcasting live entertainment such as

sporting matches and concerts in high definition virtual reality.
