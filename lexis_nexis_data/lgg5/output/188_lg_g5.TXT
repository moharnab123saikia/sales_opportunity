Battery handles always-on clock screen well;

LG G5 phone

BATTERY life:The LG G5 will get through a full day easily, even with the

always-on clock screen. During that day you can expect the phone to perform well

and at speed, as well as do all the things that are the bare minimum for a phone

- you know, making phone calls with good audio quality and decent signal

reception.



Always-on screen:Like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, the G5 has an always-on

display that shows the time on an otherwise black screen. This saves you from

waking the phone whenever you just want to know the time. As with Samsung, it's

very low in its power draw - less than 1% of the battery per hour.



Power button and fingerprint sensor:LG has previously limited its buttons to one

- a power switch and volume rocker in the middle of the phone's back. That's

almost the case here - though the volume control is now on the left edge.



The power button is also the fingerprint sensor. To turn on the phone you just

rest the finger on it, rather than pressing.- INM
