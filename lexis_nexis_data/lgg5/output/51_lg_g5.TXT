According to media reports, the company's next flagship LG G5 will sport a
unibody metal build.

This will make G5 the company's first metal-bodied smartphone and it reportedly
will take a "major step forward" on design front with the smartphone. The South
Korean giant recently launched V10 with metal trims on sides. Its current
flagship G4 has a variant with leather back.

LG is expected to launch G5 during Mobile World Congress early next year. This
means the smartphone will be launched almost at the same time as Samsung Galaxy
S7. Reports also suggest that LG is planning to make G5 available soon after its
launch.

LG Electronics recently reported a steep drop in net profit for the September
quarter on weak smartphone sales. The company's net profit for the third quarter
dipped 38% as the mobile unit continued to lose against low-cost Chinese brands
as well as against Apple and Samsung in the premium segment. LG reported 45%
drop in net profit for the March-June quarter.
