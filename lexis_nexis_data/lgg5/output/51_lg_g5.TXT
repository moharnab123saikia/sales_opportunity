LG seems all geared to launch an all-metal design smartphone with G5 in 2016.

According to media reports, the company's next flagship LG G5 will sport a

unibody metal build.



This will make G5 the company's first metal-bodied smartphone and it reportedly

will take a "major step forward" on design front with the smartphone. The South

Korean giant recently launched V10 with metal trims on sides. Its current

flagship G4 has a variant with leather back.



LG is expected to launch G5 during Mobile World Congress early next year. This

means the smartphone will be launched almost at the same time as Samsung Galaxy

S7. Reports also suggest that LG is planning to make G5 available soon after its

launch.



LG Electronics recently reported a steep drop in net profit for the September

quarter on weak smartphone sales. The company's net profit for the third quarter

dipped 38% as the mobile unit continued to lose against low-cost Chinese brands

as well as against Apple and Samsung in the premium segment. LG reported 45%

drop in net profit for the March-June quarter.
