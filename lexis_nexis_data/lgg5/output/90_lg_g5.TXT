LG has been gearing up to launch its LG Pay service this MWC along with its new
LG G5 flagship and mid range smartphones. However, LG has now pushed the launch
date back into the second quarter of the year to ensure maximum exposure for its
upcoming G5 smartphone.

According to an LG official, "LG Electronics has delayed the official launch of
LG Pay to the second quarter of this year to help the new LG flagship
smartphone, G5, receive more media attention." LG has been preparing to launch
its mobile payment service since late last year, while also partnering up with a
number of card companies. Â One of LG's affiliates also suggested that the
company is concerned about flagship smartphone sales, and is hoping that G5 will
be the handset to lift the company's mobile business.

LG's mobile payment system would be going up against the Apple and Samsung Pay
platforms, which have already established themselves in the market. However,
instead of relying only on mobile devices, LG Pay would make good use of a new
feature called the White Card, that can be tied to existing bank accounts and
cards. The card appears to make use of a small display and navigational buttons,
to allow consumers to pick between associated cards.

LG has reportedly already signed up a number of Korean card companies, but
recent rumors suggest that LG might take a while to sign on major companies in
the international market. However, an LG official denied that this claim has
anything to do with the launch delay.
