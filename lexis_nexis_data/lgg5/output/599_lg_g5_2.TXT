

With rumors of a new high-end smartphone and a two-in-one tablet PC aimed at
business users, Chinese manufacturer Huawei is hoping to make its mark on the
2016 Mobile World Congress, which runs February 22-25 in Barcelona, Spain.

Data from Gartner now puts Huawei as the world's third largest smartphone
seller, behind Samsung and Apple. The firm is expected to unveil the Huawei P9
-- set to replace the P8 launched in spring 2015 -- as a new flagship handset
for 2016.

A power-packed smartphone

Leaks and rumors on various tech websites suggest that the firm's new smartphone
could have a slightly curved 5.2-inch screen (1080p). The smartphone will no
doubt run Android 6.0 (Marshmallow), and reportedly uses a latest-generation
2.3GHz Kirin processor and 4GB of RAM.

Like the rumored Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 smartphones, the Huawei P9 could
also come with dual rear cameras. Although it's expected to debut at the
Barcelona event, the Huawei P9 may not launch in Europe or the US until sometime
this spring.

An alternative to Microsoft's Surface Pro

Another flagship Huawei product rumored for MWC is a hybrid tablet aimed at
business users. This "Matebook" device could run Windows 10, lining it up as a
rival for Microsoft's own Surface Pro 4.

This two-in-one tablet reportedly comes with a mechanical keyboard and a stylus
for quick, easy transformation into a hybrid PC -- like the Google Pixel C,
which runs Android instead of Windows. There's even a chance that Huawei's
device could support both OS.

Tech fans will have to wait until Huawei's pre-MWC event on February 21 to find
out what's in store.
