While everyone is busy running behind the Samsung Galaxy S7 or the LG G5, a new

leak for a Sony Xperia phone is out.



Thanks to leakster Evan Blass, aka @evleaks, Sony might be working on a new

Xperia phone, called the PP10. It is to be confirmed if PP10 is its actual name,

as Evan suggests that it could be a codename or retail branding. Evan leaked a

photo, in which we can see that the Xperia PP10 comes with a metallic looking

black body, that could be either metal or plastic with a metallic finish, and

average camera and LED flashlight and a likely fingerprint sensor under the

power button, similar to the Z5.



Tipped as the "Xperia PP10"
