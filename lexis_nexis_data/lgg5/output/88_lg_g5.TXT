Hollywood action star Jason Statham is promoting LG's new G5 smartphone.



The English actor, 48, features in teaser videos of the device's ads that show

him playing with the phone, which has detachable hardware modules.



The teasers feature the actor as 10 characters, including a waiter, a security

guard and even a fashionable female diner in a restaurant coyly taking a picture

with the phone.



The diversity of his roles signifies that the smartphone can be different

gadgets -like a digital camera or audio amplifier - depending on the module the

user attaches. The phone's battery has an inscription that reads: 'Life's better

when you play more.'



'Statham, whose acting breadth ranges from hardcore action to comedy, seemed to

fit with the G5,' Chosun Ilbo quoted an LG Electronics insider as saying.



LG will release the G5 worldwide, starting with Korea on Thursday. Statham's ads

will air in 20 countries at the same time, as well as online, including YouTube

and Facebook.
