Hollywood action star Jason Statham is promoting LG's new G5 smartphone.

The English actor, 48, features in teaser videos of the device's ads that show
him playing with the phone, which has detachable hardware modules.

The teasers feature the actor as 10 characters, including a waiter, a security
guard and even a fashionable female diner in a restaurant coyly taking a picture
with the phone.

The diversity of his roles signifies that the smartphone can be different
gadgets -like a digital camera or audio amplifier - depending on the module the
user attaches. The phone's battery has an inscription that reads: 'Life's better
when you play more.'

'Statham, whose acting breadth ranges from hardcore action to comedy, seemed to
fit with the G5,' Chosun Ilbo quoted an LG Electronics insider as saying.

LG will release the G5 worldwide, starting with Korea on Thursday. Statham's ads
will air in 20 countries at the same time, as well as online, including YouTube
and Facebook.
