The LG Hi-Fi Plus was developed in conjunction with B&O Play, the portable audio

arm of high-end Danish brand Bang and Olufsen, and it does justice to the

latter's considerable pedigree.



While audiophiles who wanted a digital-to- analog converter (DAC) used to have

to rely on external modules, the Hi-Fi Plus is an elegantly integrated solution.



The sleek, black unit adds just a little length to the G5, and is unobtrusive

enough to be left in permanently.



The module can support up to 32-bit music, versus the G5's already-decent

default 24-bit, and is powered by ESS Technology's well-regarded Sabre chipset.



It can also be used as a standalone DAC, thanks to a USB-C port housed in the

unit.



When you plug a device into the unit, a "Preparing Hi-Fi Plus" message appears

for a few seconds, and then you are good to go.



Audio processed by the Hi-Fi Plus is nicely detailed, and it uncovers plenty of

texture and range that is lost with the G5's default treatment.



While the Cam Plus does not add much functionality to the G5, it is the add-ons

such as the Hi-Fi Plus that really make the G5 stand out from the competition.



Â·Price: Module bundle (both the Cam Plus and the Hi-Fi Plus), $274

GRAPHIC: The Hi-Fi Plus adds just a little length to the G5 and can support up

to 32-bit music.
