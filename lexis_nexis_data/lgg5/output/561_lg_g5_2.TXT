The Energea Alupac10200 QC3 packs a capacity of 10,200mAh and features

Qualcomm's Quick Charge (QC) 3 technology.



It automatically detects QC3- compatible mobile devices for optimum charging,

and can reach up to 80 per cent battery level in 35min. Unfortunately, only a

handful of smartphones, like LG G5, currently support QC3.



But iPhone 6s Plus is not one of them. It took a rather long 1hr 24min to charge

the iPhone from 50 per cent battery level to full using the 2.4A output port.



On the plus side, the Alupac10200 has a small footprint - at only slightly

larger than your credit card. It comes in a sleek aluminium shell. Holding the

power bank with the iPhone should not cause any aching of your arm.



On its top is a power button, a micro-USB charging port and two USB output ports

that are sited close to each other. This proximity might be an issue when you

want to insert and pull out the USB cables connected to both.

Â·Verdict: If you own QC3-support smartphones, you need to buy the Energea

Alupac10200 QC3. Even if you don't, you can future-proof yourself.

How we tested



The Straits Times tests seven high-capacity - 10,000mAh or above - power banks

to see which one gives the best bang for the buck.



Each power bank is used to charge an Apple iPhone 6s Plus from 50 per cent to

full using the Energea NylonTough Lightning Cable, while running 11 apps in the

background and playing Pokemon Go.
