

? WE can't make up our minds if LG's new G5 smartphone is simply bonkers or
utterly brilliant.

One thing we do know is that it's certainly different.

? As well as a new all-metal finish and two rear cameras, the G5 has a unique
modular design which allows users to add and remove companion products,
including a camera kit, more battery power and even a posh audio player from
Bang & Olufsen.

Other features include a 5.3in Quad HD IPS Quantum display and a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 processor.

? Prices and release date have yet to be announced by LG.
