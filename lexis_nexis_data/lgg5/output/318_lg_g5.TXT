? WE can't make up our minds if LG's new G5 smartphone is simply bonkers or

utterly brilliant.



One thing we do know is that it's certainly different.



? As well as a new all-metal finish and two rear cameras, the G5 has a unique

modular design which allows users to add and remove companion products,

including a camera kit, more battery power and even a posh audio player from

Bang & Olufsen.



Other features include a 5.3in Quad HD IPS Quantum display and a Qualcomm

Snapdragon 820 processor.



? Prices and release date have yet to be announced by LG.
