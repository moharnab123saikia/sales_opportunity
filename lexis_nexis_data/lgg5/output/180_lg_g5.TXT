Substandard products have remained a clog in Nigeria's bid for industrialisation
and the housing sector appears to be the worst hit. This is because substandard
building materials are still flooding the market. The damage this has done to
Nigerian industrialisation is better imagined than experienced considering the
quantum of destruction witnessed by those using them.


Whether the menace would continue or abate is a matter of conjecture as
Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) seems handicapped by the various lapses
that hinder its drive to stamp  the scourge out of the system.
The SON has the mandate to support and regulate made-in-Nigeria goods as a way
of developing the economy and at the same time check imported goods.
Nigerian producers have three major disadvantages because they are operating in
a disadvantaged infrastructural environment and naturally the costs of their
products are higher than those of their competitors overseas. But even more
important is the fact that these products are competing with substandard
products and menace of dumping. Every nation must protect its industries such
that others would not come and bring products and sell below the normal price
such a product should go for considering all the cost elements.
SON has been complaining that absence of its personnel at the nation's borders
has made it difficult to prevent the influx of substandard foreign products into
the country. Despite the challenges posed by porous borders, it said it is
devising a mechanism to effectively monitor the borders.
oPorous boarders: SON lamented that out of the 155 entry borders in the country,
only five are monitored by operatives of the organisation. There is, therefore,
need for Nigerians to assist the agency in its efforts to eradicate sub-standard
products in the country and one of the ways to do this is to patronise products
that have the Nigeria Industrial Standard (NIS) certification mark in the case
of locally made products and SON mark for foreign products. The danger posed by
the consumption of substandard goods to the health of the nation cannot be
overemphasised. The implication is that the boarders are not properly guarded by
both the Customs and Immigration officials.
oIllegal vessel discharge: The fact that the boarders are not properly
monitored, means that vessels carrying all sorts of goods are not checked but
are allowed to dump things that ordinarily would be regulated out into the
country.
oCompromise on the part of law enforcement agents: It is clear that most of the
illegal dumps pass through regulated ports. Many of the substandard goods that
pass through the Nigerian boarders were certified by law enforcement agents.
When these goods come into the country, what the owners do is just tip the law
enforcement agents at the boarders and they are allowed in to the detriment of
the country. oForeign collaborators: If foreign suppliers check what goes out of
their ports, they would be able to check the continued production of substandard
goods. Since they have failed to do that, the owners would have passed the first
hurdles and the moment the Nigerian boarders are also permeated, the goods would
eventually find their way into the market.
oPoor policy implementation: Most times, policy summersault results in the
manufacture of goods that do not meet the local standard. This forces some of
the goods earlier banned but are lying in the ports to be allowed into the
country.
oGlut of foreign goods: Most Nigerians craving for foreign goods do anything to
discourage the made-in-Nigeria goods. Some government officials, while on
official trips overseas, use the opportunity to bring in all those things that
are banned in the country. And because the security agents do eye service, and
do not check their luggage.
oPoor economy: Due to poverty, some security agents collect tips from importers
to let go these substandard products only for their colleagues to chase the
goods down to the market or the consumers homes.
oBusiness environment: The Nigerian environment is not so regulated because very
few Nigerians can be patriotic enough to help the security agents. This is why
there is influx of small arms in the country. If the business environment does
not suit it, it can't thrive.
oGlitch: Technology has remained the greatest of problems in various boarders in
the country. Most officials that check and test these foreign goods do not have
the matching equipment to measure them and so they are bamboozled into accepting
substandard products as quality standards.
oHigh level of ignorance on the dangers of substandard goods: Most of those who
deal on and patronise these substandard goods cannot trace their origin and are
unaware of the danger they pose to their health. In the case of the second hand
goods termed okirika, they don't know where they were picked from but only that
the designs suit them.
oPoor sensitisation: The fact that government is not doing enough to educate the
public on all these, the public would continue to fall victim. Many times some
sicknesses that are alien to our environment are brought in through such means
while government looks elsewhere.
Some time ago, SON lamented that some of the companies it regulates are yet to
key into its Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) for local
manufacturers even as there is no evidence of SON's Conformity Assessment
Programme (SONCAP) certification for their raw materials importation.  According
to the Acting Director General, SON,  Dr. Paul Angya, "when our Inspectorate and
Compliance team visited some steel pipes companies recently, it was rather
amazing that some of them were not even aware of the applicable industrial
standards. Some of the companies were even manufacturing according to the
specifications given to them by particular clients.
"The situation cannot be tolerated in an organised economy. We have discovered
the level of pipes in circulation  without any identification  marks for
traceability of the pipes to particular manufacturers in line with the
requirement of NIS 324:1997 and NIS 198:1984, non-compliant  gauges, early
corrosion  as well as short length.
We are determined to reduce the level of substandard products in circulation to
the barest minimum."
you are therefore offered this opportunity to embark on immediate house cleaning
and serve your customers well. The time to begin is now and SON will do the best

 possible to protect those unsuspecting consumers. As a facilitating agency, we
are giving you three months from today to address these issues effectively or
face sanctions.
"SON will immediately shut down the operations of anyone caught as an economic
saboteur. We therefore called this meeting to enable all hollow pipes
manufacturing companies to know the right things to do and carry them out. As it

 is our style, immediate enforcement begins after this forum while we give a
guided grace period of 90 days for those who want to tidy up their
non-conforming operations before we carry out wholesome raiding, seizure and
evacuation of all sub- standard pipes in warehouses and firms as well as
prosecution of offenders."

SON pegs 5-yr jail term, N5m for substandard goods dealers

The weather may soon become hotter for dealers in substandard goods if the
warning by the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) to jail defaulters for
five years without any option of fine is anything to go by.
The SON recently said that it is poised to deal with any company bent on feeding
the Nigerian public with substandard goods. It made the revelation during the
SON/Steel Pipes Stakeholders' Consultative Forum held at the African Sun Hotel,
Ikeja, Lagos, recently where about seven steel pipes manufacturers were in
attendance.
Speaking at the forum, the Acting Director General of SON, Dr. Paul Angya, said
after the SON team inspected the manufacturing processes of some hollow steel
pipes manufacturing companies to ascertain their level of compliance to the
current Nigeria Industrial Standards (NIS), it was found that they were not
complying with the rules.
Angya stated that henceforth, any company still dealing in substandard goods
would be regarded as an economic saboteur to the country and would not be
treated kindly. He said there is five-year jail term for manufacturers of
substandard goods without option of fine, adding that if the presiding judge is
lenient, he could fine the company N5 million in addition to being shut down.
"The present SON under my watch will not condone shortchanging of consumers'
value for money or flooding the markets with substandard products," he said.
"SON will immediately shut down the operations of anyone caught as an economic
saboteur. We therefore called this meeting to enable all hollow pipes
manufacturing companies to know the right things to do and carry them out. As it
is our style, immediate enforcement begins after this forum while we give a
guided grace period of 90 days for those who want to tidy up their
non-conforming operations before we carry out wholesome raid, seizure and
evacuation of all substandard pipes in warehouses and firms as well as
prosecution of offenders," he said.
Angya noted that there was need to confirm the manufacturing processes in line
with applicable standard, quality control and quality assurance and factors
responsible for non-compliant products in circulation as well as take
appropriate action.

Device to download 5-6 apps a day berths in Lagos with LG G5

A new flagship mobile device, the LG G5, created to unleash people's desire to
play around with its environment has berthed in Lagos. It is a device that
captures the excitement of what a smartphone is meant to be.
According to the Managing Director, LG, Mr. S. H. Kim, when smartphones were
first introduced, the public were so fascinated that they could download five to
six apps a day. He stated that these days, the public do not see much excitement
anymore even when a new smartphone is released.
He therefore asked, "Does that mean people's appetite for fun has disappeared?
Of course not. Today's consumers are just looking elsewhere, such as action
cameras or drones. Does that mean the era of smartphones is over? At LG, we
think smartphones' best days are still ahead. The LG G5 is not the only device
we'd like to introduce to the public this time."
Kim stated that the device, LG G5, comes with "Friends" - extensive companion
devices that enhance the user experience in dynamic ways. He explained that
these "Friends" have been optimised to play with the LG G5.
He further explained: "At LG, we believe that 'Life's good when you play more'
and we actually have enjoyed every step of creating the G5 and Friends, dreaming
to reignite your instinct to play. The future of smartphones is still full of
possibilities and the LG G5 and Friends are just the beginning."
He said, as a transformative, modular design, the new LG G5 is made to help the
user get the most out of life. "It is a forward-thinking modular design that
lets you use companion devices for enhanced camera capabilities. The slide-out
battery can be swapped in a flash to help the user stay connected.
"Designed with compromise, the LG G5's sleek, light weight and colourful. The 3D
arc glass of the phone gives the display a gentle curve on the top of the device
for a seamless look. With a balance of form and function, the LG G5's modular
design lets you customise your phone features based on your needs. Simply slide
the battery out and replace it with LG Friend, when it comes to features," he
concluded.
If this is so, then why settle when you can have it all," he concluded.

FG urged to develop grazing reserves in North

From Theresa Egba, Abuja

Fulani herdsmen, under the umbrella of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders
Association, have called on the Federal Government to focus more in developing
grazing reserves in the North following the crisis between herdsmen and farmers
in the country.
The National Secretary of the group, Baba Othman Ngelzarma, made the call in an
interview at a retreat on Livestock and Dairy Development in Abuja, yesterday,
with the theme, "Setting an Agenda for Commercialising Livestock and Dairy in
Nigeria."
According to him, grazing reserve, which was proposed by the Federal Government
should be immediately looked into while ranching should be done in due process.
"Ranching should be planned for but they should focus more on the grazing
reserve. We have 415 grazing areas in Nigeria, 141 areas are gazetted and are
mostly located in the North. Three to four are located in Oyo and Ogun states.
The Federal Government is the owner of these lands while the state governments
are only custodians.
"Cattle breeders are willing to accept this plan set aside for them because we
are already sensitising them. They too are tired, they have lost their
properties and families in the course of the crisis," he said.
The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, while
delivering his keynote address, [#x200e]assured that steps are being taken for
cattle improvement programme, which will be aggressively pursued using
artificial insemination.
According to him, steps are being taken to improve the quality and quantity of
milk as well as beef quality in Nigeria, including "establishment of clusters of
diary farmers, which would be equipped with milk collection facilities,
establishment of ranches to be planted with high quality improved tropical grass
varieties and quality waters. Some of the grass seed would be imported to
Nigeria.
"Capacity building for dairy farmers, among others development of livestock and
dairy industry occupies a prime position in the agricultural roadmap of the
current administration. The intention is to develop a sustainable livestock and
dairy industry," he said.
Earlier, Food Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)
representative, Dr. Louise L. Setshwaelo, proffered that to address the long
standing and long term challenges, the livestock sector needs to prioritise a
few critical areas that would ultimately make tangible impact to its
productivity, liavelihoods and competitiveness.
