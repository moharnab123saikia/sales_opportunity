Got gadgets on your mind this Christmas? Most of us do, trend and marketing

analysts say, and we'll spend almost twice what we did last year on them.



Although high-definition televisions will be high on many wish lists this year,

portability still rules when consumers choose technology. Consequently, most of

us will want to see smaller devices under the tree, such as laptop computers,

digital cameras and mobile phones.



But which one? The variety of gift-giving possibilities is broad, and the

differences between devices can be hard to distinguish, at first glance.



So, before you bundle up to brave the cold, the traffic and the long lines,

check out this list of good deals on small and medium-size technology this

holiday season. Price ranges are approximate:



* Apple iMac G5 -- Simply the best compact desktop computer around. All but the

keyboard and mouse fits neatly behind the viewing screen. And now it comes with

a remote control, so you can browse files from across the room. Upgrades -- such

as adding more memory -- can be problematic, but if you replace your computer

every two years, as most people do, they may not matter. ($1,300-$1,700;

* Averatec 4200 Series laptop -- It's both attractive and functional. The white

polymer finish contrasts nicely with a screen lid that comes in several colors.

The 4200 is not only light on your pocketbook, but at 4.5 pounds it also is

light enough to carry in a small book bag. Perhaps the biggest plus is the

multi-format DVD burner -- rare for portables in this price range. ($950-$1,400;

* Verizon LG VX9800 -- It's a phone; it's a multimedia center. Flip open the

clamshell lid and you'll find a full QWERTY keypad, dual sound speakers and an

extra wide viewing screen, the better to see V CAST -- video-on-demand

programming downsized to fit on a mobile phone. V CAST is available through

Verizon's new high-speed cellular service. ($100-$250;

* Casio Exilim EX-S500 -- A good choice for traveling light. Among its best

features, the Exilim has an "anti-shake" control that minimizes photo blur. The

slim body is thinner than a stack of credit cards, but, fortunately, you don't

need a stack to buy one. ($279-$400; http://www.exilim.casio.com/)



* Apple iPod nano -- So what if it scratches easily? Get a carrying case. If you

look past the cosmetic appeal, you'll find a sturdy device that sets the

standard for future portable music players, including other iPods. The

larger-storage model holds about 1,000 songs or 25,000 photos. Best of all, its

solid-state design means songs won't skip no matter how hard you work or play.

($200-$250; http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/)



* Global Pet Finder -- Maybe your home is where the buffalo roam, but you still

don't want Fido straying too far. The Pet Finder employs both two-way wireless

and satellite-mapping technologies to keep your loved one on a leash, of a sort.

It slips onto your pet's collar and transmits locator signals to your computer

or mobile phone, telling you where your furry wanderer is at all times. ($350;
