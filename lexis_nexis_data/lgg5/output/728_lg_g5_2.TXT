The iPod started the trend for gadgets in white and now it has overtaken black

as the coolest colour for everything from phones to keyboards - even the

Blackberry has gone all virginal. This week, BONNIE ESTRIDGE finds the best ones

around



BEST GIRLIE E-MAILER White Blackberry Pearl, free on contract.



Stockists: 0845 412 2401/www.t-mobile. co. uk This new white version comes

complete with glowing "pearl" (actually a rollerball for navigating the menu).

Has an MP3 player and camera and although the QWERTY keyboard is small and

fiddly, this is a must-have for fashionistas who want to show off their

e-mailer.



BEST POCKET SAT-NAV Mio H610, GBP 300.



Stockists: 08453 45 42 45/www. mio-tech. be Pretty pocket-sized satnav with an

MP3 player, photo viewer and games. Has good, clear mapping and preloaded speed

camera warnings with free updates for one year. Small and slightly fiddly with a

2.7in display, its trendy white, interchangeable bezel makes a change from the

usual sober style.



BEST LOVELY LAPTOP MacBook G5, GBP 749.



Stockists: 0800 039 1010/ www. apple. com/uk Great price for a cool laptop with

all the features of its more expensive rivals - and it looks terrific too. The

13.3in widescreen basic version has 512MB memory, 60GB hard drive, a speedy

Intel Core 2 Duo processor and some great software - making it an excellent buy.



BEST COOL KEYBOARD Logitech S 530 Cordless Desktop for Mac, GBP 69.99.



Stockists: 020 7309 0127/ www. logitech. co. uk This slim, flat wireless

keyboard with matching mouse has been especially designed for Apple Macs.



Good-looking and extremely comfortable to use, the keyboard has one-touch

buttons for instant access to iTunes, iPhoto and other functions as well as an

integrated wrist support.



BEST KITCHEN RADIO Pure One Digital Radio, GBP 49.50. Stockists:



M & S Home, 0845 603 1603/ www. marksandspencer. com Shiny DAB radio perfect for

the kitchen as it has a clock with a cooking timer. It is easy to set up and use

with scrolling text display and 20 station pre-sets. The radio can be mains or

battery operated and also has an FM tuner for when it is out of range of the

digital signal.



BEST IPOD RIVAL Creative Zen Vision M, GBP 189.99.



Stockists: 0800 376 7954/ www. creative.



com This sleek, 30GB MP3 player poses a real threat to the iPod, with its

capacity to store 15,000 songs. As well as playing videos, it also stores tens

of thousands of photos which can be viewed with "zoom-in" function on the bright

2.1in colour display. Easy to use with neat vertical touch-pad.



BEST DESKTOP DISTRACTION LaCie Stack & Play Brick Mobile Hard Drive, GBP 85.90.



Stockists: 020 7017 0040/www. lacie. com Is it a Lego brick? No, it's a 120GB

hard drive but the 5.1 x 4.4in bricks stack so you can expand the capacity by

adding more in different colours.



BEST FOR TEENAGE DJs Hercules Mobile DJ MP3, GBP 59.



Stockists: 020 7556 7843/www. amazon. co. uk Wannabee "bedroom" DJs and

composers will love this tiny mixer which transmits tracks from a computer to

the 6.8 x 6in console and then back to the computer for burning CDs. It has two

decks, a good-sized display and can be used for live mixes at parties with a

laptop.



BEST TASTY PHONE LG White Chocolate, from free on contract, and payas-you-go

from GBP 119.95.



Stockists: Carphone Warehouse, 0800 925 925/ www. carphonewarehouse. com Who

knows what chocolate has to do with this phone, except that it looks delicious.

This is a wafer-thin slider phone with touch-sensitive keys that glow when they

are being used and fade into the background when they're not needed. Has an MP3

player, 1.3 megapixel camera, games and all the usual functions.



BEST VALUE DIGICAM Fuji FinePix Z2 Zoom Digital Camera, GBP 129.99. Stockists:



0845 800 1020/ www. play. com Attractive 5.1 megapixel digicam has 3 x optical

zoom, plenty of shooting modes and a free 128MB XD memory card.



Also takes short video clips and has a sliding lens cover.



This is not Fuji's latest model and is bulkier than some digital cameras but is

a very good little camera at a great price.
