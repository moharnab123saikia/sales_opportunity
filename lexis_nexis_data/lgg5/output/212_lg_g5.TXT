The handset features a dual screen and dual camera setup.



Announced in September, the LG V20 is rolling out in global markets. After the

G5's lacklustre reception, LG clearly wants to take on the Galaxy S7 and iPhone

7 with its new phone. In fact, the Korean company is all set to launch its

latest flagship in India. According to gadgets.ndtv.com, the V20 will be pegged

at Rs 49,990.



Departing from the gimmicky modular design of the G5, the V20 embraces a

streamlined premium look. It phone features a backplate that provides access to

a 3200 mAh battery. It's impressive how LG has retained the swappable battery

without compromising on the design.



Much like its predecessor, the LG V20 sports two screens. The primary one is a

5.7-incher with 2560x1440 pixels. The 2.1-inch secondary display with pixel

dimensions of 160x1040 sits above the main screen. It is basically used for

pushing notifications and alerts.



In addition to the dual screens, the phone sports a dual-camera setup. The

primary camera comprises of a 16-megapixel OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation)

module coupled with an 8-megapixel depth sensor. This should provide some neat

features to play with the depth of field in photos. For selfies, you have to

settle for a 5-megapixel snapper.



The handset is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 chipset. Thanks to a 4 GB

RAM, multitasking won't be an issue at all. The V20 comes with 64 GB internal

storage and microSd card slot that supports up to 2 TB of additional space.

Other features include a fingerprint sensor, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 LE,

A-GPS, NFC, USB Type-C port, and 3200 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0.
