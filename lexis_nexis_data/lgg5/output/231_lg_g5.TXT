LG G5 Price: (EURO)700 unlocked from www.Expansys.ie Rating: ????? HHHHH

Remember when you could add things to phones other than Hello Kitty protective

cases? Back in the day, what made a phone cool was the way it slotted into

something (or something slotted into it). LG's new flagship 5.3-inch G5 phone

pays homage to this idea with its 'modular' design.



You can literally remove the bottom of the phone and add in different physical

bits of hardware. It could just be a replacement battery. But there are also

camera grips, VR sets and digital DAC music players that are compatible with it.

The phone has some other interesting specs, too. LG has put two cameras on the

back of the phone, a main 16-megapixel snapper and a second, wide-angle,

8-megapixel lens.



It adds a lot to the type of photo you can shoot on this handset.
