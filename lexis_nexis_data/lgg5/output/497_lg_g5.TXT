 ZTE Senior Director of Mobile Devices Waiman Lam said in an interview at the
Mobile World Congress that the company is cautiously targeting growth of around
60 million units, which would mark a 7 percent rise in unit sales from 2015.
 The higher end of its target range, 70 million units, would represent around 20
percent growth over 2015.
 ZTE unveiled two new models in its high-volume, value-priced line and unveiled
a new sports marketing partnership with Spanish football club Seville, taking a
page from a strategy that has turned ZTE into the 4th largest U.S. smartphone
vendor.

 A slightly larger Blade V7 sports a 5.2-inch screen in a metallic case for
single-hand use and both front and rear 13-megapixel cameras. Instead of
fingerprint security, it offers ZTE's retinal eye-scan feature and goes on sale
in summer.
