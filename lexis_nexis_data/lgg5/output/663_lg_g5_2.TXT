A full charge takes only 73 minutes.



It's all wham bam in the smartphone industry with the release of the OnePlus

latest offering-The OnePlus 3. But amongst the aura of this 3rd flagship killer

from the not so new company lies a amazing technology known as Dash charging.



What exactly is Dash Charge?



Dash Charge is a new quick-charge technology from OnePlus. It promises to

provide 60% of a full charge in just 30 minutes of charging.



While it's not something which already doesn't exist in the market under the

name of Quick charge 3.0 which boasts that it could charge upto 80% in 35

minutes.This tech is present I the rivals like S7 egde.



How exactly is the Dash Charge better than Qualcomm Quick charge 3.0?



Unike Quick Charge 3.0, Dash charge produces a larger electrical current (this

time 5V/4A for 20W) rather than increasing the pressure, which results in a more

stable and consistent charge.



This means that the charging process remains fast even though you're using your

phone or putting it to sweat by playing high-intensity gaming. This also rules

out the possibility of Overheating while charging also.



So how fast does the dash charge charge the OnePlus 3?



15 minutes-20% charge (charge started from 0%)



30 minutes-62% charge



60 minutes-94% charge



73 minutes-100% charge



This is till now the best charging time from 0 to 100% when compared to the

second best the LG G5 which took 77 minutes. The S7 takes 89 minutes to charge

fully.



Although the battery life is not great but the Dash charging technology has got

it all covered up with a quick battery refill in just 30 minutes.
