LG recently confirmed that the LG G5, the latest flagship, will be launched on

the February 21 in Barcelona. However, it might not just be the G5.



It wasn't much of a surprise when LG announced the date, mainly because of the

"save the date" notice that LG sent out three weeks back. LG has managed to keep

the G5 behind locked doors for a while, but a few leaks have sprung. The phone

is rumored to be coming with a full metal body, dual cameras, USB Type-C, rear

mounted fingerprint sensor and a volume rocker which has been moved back to the

side of the phone. It will also come with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the

box.



LG also shared an image as part of the invite which reads "Come meet new friends

on the playground", which according to the writers at TechRadar seems to be

implying a new VR system from LG. The three characters on the invite are a

robot, biplane and a wizard goldfish, however, it is highly unlikely that LG has

been working on something with robotics. We know that LG will be releasing two

flagships this year, but both together might not be a smart move.
