smartphone next month. And to build up anticipation for the same, the
manufacturer has now revealed new details about the audio system of the device.
LG announced that it has partnered with premium audio products maker B&O Play
for the V20. Not only will the upcoming smartphone feature audio system
developed in partnership with B&O Play, it'll also come with B&O Play earphones.

Speaking about the same, Juno Cho, president of LG Electronics and Mobile
Communications, said, "I'm pleased about our close partnership with B&O Play
which started earlier this year with Hi-Fi Plus with B&O Play and continues
today with the V20. A growing number of consumers expect a better audio
experience from their smartphones than what has been available in the past and
I'm confident that the V20 delivers on these expectations."Recently, LG posted
some images on its official US Instagram account, claiming to have clicked them
with the V20. The images offered details about the camera setup of the device.
The successor to the V10, the LG V20 is expected to come with a dual camera
setup. This would comprise a wide angle lens and a normal lens, pretty much the
same as that of the G5. One of the images posted by the company clearly
indicates that it has been taken using a wide angle lens. A GIF was also posted
to the Instagram account. It seems that users will be able to select specific
parts of the images to animate, while keeping others static.
