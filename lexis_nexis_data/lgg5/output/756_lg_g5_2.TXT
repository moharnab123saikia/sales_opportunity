Every year around this time Samsung and other smartphone makers launch their

flagship devices. This year too, many including Samsung have started to roll out

the flagship devices. One of the first to come to India is the Samsung Galaxy S7

Edge. This is one of the most awaited phones of early 2016 and we got our hands

on it for a review. Let's take a closer look and see if this smartphone is worth

the shiny penny.



Design and display



Let's admit it; the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a gorgeous device. The curve on

the back panel has been borrowed from the successful Samsung Note 5 from last

year. The front screen panel curves into the aluminium frame not just on the

sides but at the top and bottom as well. This gives the phone a seamless

ergonomic body which sits perfect in the hand. Last year's Samsung Galaxy S6

Edge had only one design flaw, which was the edges cutting into the palms of the

person holding it for a while. This has been fixed in the Samsung Galaxy S7

Edge, as the edges are smoother than before.



Moving further the phone's curved Gorilla Glass 4 is held together by space

grade aluminium, which enables the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge to privode an IP68

rating. Simply put, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is waterproof and dust-proof.

Samsung has brought back the expandable storage option in this smartphone, too.

The credit for pushing Samsung to re-introduce the expandable storage goes to

the people who made the company feel just how important a feature it is for a

flagship mobile to have.



On the flipside, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge can hold just one sim card and a

memory card or two sim cards. One can't have both sim cards and the SD card on

at the same time. Samsung has decided to retain the single button design below

the display, which again serves as the fingerprint scanner.



The Samsung Galaxy S7 fingerprint scanner has seen some major improvements and

can now be considered the fastest fingerprint scanner on any smartphone. We

tested it out and yes it is quite fast to react.



The placement of the sim slot, 3.5 mm audio-jack, USB connector and the volume

and the power buttons are the same as seen on the S6. The Samsung Galaxy S7

Edge's now sits almost flat on a table with the significantly reduced camera

module at the back.



The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge's excels in the display department. The screen is

absolutely stunning and displays lively colours. The quad-HD screen with a

resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixel density reproduces brilliant hues using the

super AMOLED technology. The best part of the screen is that it can be viewed

from the most difficult angles without any distortion of the image, and this

cannot be said for some of the best LED TV's in the market right now.



Camera and performance



Samsung has scaled down the megapixels for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and now

uses a 12 MP rear camera. This just proves that a high megapixel is no longer a

relevant criterion for a good camera. Instead they are now employing a new Dual

Pixel technology with a bigger aperture size of f/1.7 and larger pixel sensors.

The larger pixels enable lightning fast focussing on the target. The Dual Pixel

technology makes all the pixels a possible sensor for focussing and not just

certain pixels.



The camera app now launches even faster than before and the shutter speeds on

auto are very impressive. The 'pro' mode in the camera app now has support for

controlling the shutter speed and an even greater ISO range. Ofcourse you cannot

get a DLSR like shot from the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, however Samsung has got a

sure winner when it comes to picture quality (indoors and outdoors) and low

light shots.



The front 5MP camera is as impressive as the rear one and now boasts a

wide-angle lens, which simply means more faces can fit in your selfies. This

time Samsung borrowed the front screen flash from Apple and has incorporated it

to the Galaxy S7 Edge.



Samsung's own Exynos 7420 processor was a hit last year with their Galaxy S6

phones in India and topped the benchmarking tests while other phones with the

Snapdragon 810 came second. This time Samsung has used the Snapdragon 820 in

some regions and their own Exynos 8890 processor in the rest. The phones in

India will feature the Exynos 8890 variant and comes with an internal storage of

32GB.



The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge processor runs eight-cores, with four of them running

at 2.6GHz and the other four at 1.59GHz. This works in tandem with a Mali T880

GPU and 4GB DDR4 RAM to demolish any app or game lag. It aced the benchmarking

tests and scored a blazing 1,14,575 on AnTuTu benchmark leaving every other

device biting the dust.



Even though Samsung is now using liquid cooling technology in the Galaxy S7

Edge, it does heat up while installing apps or charging. The speakers are at the

bottom like the last phone and are loud enough to be heard while walking on the

street with the phone in your pocket. An area where Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has

seen a big improvement is the battery life. It now sports a bigger 3,600mAh

battery that lasts almost 24 hours under nominal-extensive use.



We could not try out the Samsung Pay as it is not available in India yet, but

the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge now offers concierge services in its 'My Galaxy' app

with special discounts and services like an assistant, cabs, grocery, recharge,

phone pick-up and drop services, et al. Samsung has also added a new method

where the app drawer can be eliminated altogether and the apps can be brought

out to the main screen. This can be accessed in a section called 'Galaxy Labs'

in the settings.



Inside the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is the custom TouchWiz user interface, which

is almost identical to the S6 Edge (that just received the Marshmallow update).

The Edge screens now have a variety of accessibility and apps ready. This does

help locate important apps quickly, but the double rows mean that the look is

slightly cluttered. There have been some new additions to the Edge screens too

with Yahoo news, weather, scale, compass, etc.



Verdict



The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has taken a leap ahead of all the other flagships

this year and the closest to it in specs is the LG G5. We gave this phone a nice

bath as well and it survived the dip. When it comes to the purchase, it is a

gorgeous phone that is worth buying if you do not mind spending the extra penny.



The Galaxy S6 Edge with the Marshmallow update has almost similar user interface

features now and is retailing for much lower than what the Samsung Galaxy S7

Edge is at. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge launched at a gap of 11 months from the

last Galaxy phone and shows little promise in terms of a rapid upgrade. But, it

is a great buy for a first time Galaxy user. The new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is

available for Rs 56,900 and is a worthy competitor to phones like the Apple

iPhone 6S Plus.
