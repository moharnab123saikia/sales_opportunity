By tbreak Staff -



The LG G5 is all set to launch at the MWC 2016, and although we still haven't

seen any official images of it, a new official Quick Cover case has emerged, and

it does look pretty.



The new form-fitting case wraps the G5 phone in a semitransparent mesh metal,

which leaves tiny openings through which to see incoming call notifications.

Similar to the LG K10 Quick Cover View, calls can be answered by swiping on the

cover itself, without having to flip open the protective cover. The phone will

respond to touch even when it is closed.



From the image of the cover, we can see that there is a huge cutout at the top

for the newly announced LG G5 always on display, that will act as a second

screen. This second screen will display time, date and up to four notification

icons.



According to an official press release the Quick Cover case uses a unique film

and glossy metallic finish for a smooth and luxurious look to complement the LG

G5, tipping that the phone might be made of metal, as opposed to the G4, which

was made of plastic with a metallic finish.



Price and availability of the Quick Cover case is yet to be revealed.
