Silicon giant Qualcomm is enabling three of the big announcements at the annual

Mobile World Congress (MWC) this year, including the much anticipated Samsung

Galaxy S7, the modular LG G5 and the enterprise oriented HP Elite X3. These

devices are all powered by the new Snapdraon 820 processor, which Qualcomm

claims will usher in never before seen efficiencies in how data ecosystems and

speeds.



Steve Mollenkopf, chief executive officer of Qualcomm Incorporated, said

smartphone technologies were already spilling over into other fields and 5G will

be taking 4G to scale with a strong product perspective.



Cristiano Amon, executive vice president of Qualcomm Technologies and president

of Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), said with Snapdragon 820 VR use cases will

become very real and future versions will even enable desktop scenarios. "The

importance of timing the audio and visual is very high in VR," added Mollenkopf.



Qualcomm is also ushing in the Snapdragon X16 Modem, which will for the first

time usher in Gigabit speed LTE, in the second half of this year. Peter Carson,

senior director of marketing, says while the first products will be Wi-Fi

routers by the end of this year, smartphones can be expected to run the modem in

the near future. "That is tougher because of the form factor and thermal

footprint," he says, adding that competitors are clearly playing catch up with

Qualcomm on LTE.



Meanwhile, Sony surprised everyone by announcing a bunch of new phones, the

Xperia X, Xperia X Performance, Xperia X Premium and Xperia XA. The Xperia XA

runs a MediaTek processor and might come to India as a budget offering, while

the Xperia X Premium apparently runs a Snapdragon 820.



The showstoppers clearly are the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 launched on Sunday.

The most crowds are lining up to see these two new phone. The LG G5 is clearly

the more innovative of the two ushering in the option of adding modular

appendages improve audio quality, camera results and battery life.



Lenovo, meanwhile, showcased the Vibe K5 and Vibe K5 Plus which can be expected

to hit the Indian market soon. The company is already the third largest

smartphone manufacturer in India along with Motorola and is expected to

strengthen its offering in the $150-range with these new phones.



One little-known device that could have a lot of promise is the Ozo 360-degree

camera from Nokia which will be the first professional grade VR camera. Price

upwards of $60,000, the cameras could find widespread use in the movie industry,

according to the Finnish technology company which is exploring new avenues since

selling its smartphone business to Microsoft. Given that Samsung beamed its

Galaxy S7 launch event on Sunday in VR, we can now assume that VR has finally

gone mainstream.
