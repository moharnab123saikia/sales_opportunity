HTC Desire EYE, £184 at one www.digitals.co.uk



The Eye has a 13MP camera on the back and another on the front. What's more,

both cameras have a dualcolour LED flash and sensors that work well in low

light. Clever settings let you take a selfie by just speaking. Say "Cheese" for

a photo and "Action" to shoot video, all handsfree. And before I forget, it's

waterproof, too.



LG G5, free on contract at www.ee.co.uk, or £449 (no contract) at carphone

www.warehouse.com



LG's latest flagship has a clever auto shot for selfies. Some front cameras

shoot when they spot you smiling, others when you wave. This one shoots when it

recognises and focuses on your face (or several faces for a group selfie). It's

automatic. Not the shot you wanted? Keep framing and it will keep snapping,

roughly every two seconds.



Apple iPhone 6s, from £539 at www.apple.com/uk



Apple's frontfacing camera is just 5MP but it has a clever extra feature that

many other phones don't. Instead of a dedicated flash like the HTC, the iPhone

works out what colour light would help the shot best, and flashes the screen at

a greater brightness than the display can usually manage. The result is the best

selfies the iPhone has ever taken. See it to believe it.
