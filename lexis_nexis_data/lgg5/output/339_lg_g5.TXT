and the Samsung Gear VR was made available last year. So where does that leave
other mobile companies? If you're LG, it leaves you developing your own headset.
The LG 360 VR headset is part Gear, part Vive inspired. On the one hand, it uses
the smartphone for VR content, similar to the Gear; but like the Vive, it has
its own display, making it a more lightweight offering than the Gear. That's
where things end though and the LG 360 goes its own way. It's a much more
compact headset than any of the ones being offered, which has the advantage of
make it more lightweight but the downside to that is that it doesn't feel quite
as effective at sealing off the real world.

It works with the LG G5, tethering it to the phone through a USB-C cable,
meaning you'll need to invest in LG's brand new phone, too.
