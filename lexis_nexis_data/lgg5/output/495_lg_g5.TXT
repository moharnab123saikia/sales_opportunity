After months of leaks and speculation, Samsung officially launched its flagship

Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge handsets, right, at the event in Barcelona.



Looking almost identical to last year's models, arguably its key "new" feature

is the return of an old one, with the inclusion of an expandable memory slot.



There are also improvements on water resistance, an "always on display" function

for notifications, while the souped-up rear camera should focus quicker and work

better in low light. More a refinement than anything revolutionary, expect a

full review in the coming week.



Far more radical was LG's new G5 Android smartphone, which uses a modular design

allowing it to gain extra functions via add-on parts. The plug-in set available

at launch for the phone, left, includes a digital to analogue converter made by

Bang & Olufsen, allowing the handset to play back hi-res audio, while a camera

attachment brings manual dial controls for zoom and focusing.



Samsung's Gear VR and LG's VR 360 both got their moment in the spotlight, but

amongst all of the virtual reality headsets being showcased in Barcelona, HTC

Vive impressed the most.



Developed alongside games maker Valve it appears more advanced than its nearest

rival, Facebook's Oculus Rift, with better bespoke hand controllers and a camera

system that allows the wearer to see real objects, helping them to avoid bumping

into furniture (pressing a button on the controller allows objects to appear in

ghost form, superimposed onto the virtual reality environment). The downside is

a pretty hefty asking price (a $799 price tag was confirmed at the show) and the

need for a fairly powerful PC to pair it with.



Elsewhere, the tech powering the FLIR thermal imaging camera add-on for iPhones

we reviewed a few weeks ago comes built-in with a new smartphone by dumper truck

maker Caterpillar, right. Named the CAT S60, among its other ultra-rugged

features is its ability to function underwater for about an hour at a depth of

16 feet.



The main standout from Sony's stand at the show was an earpiece that offers an

audible virtual assistant. Not dissimilar to Scarlett Johansson's computerised

PA in the film Her, Sony's Ear links up to your Android smartphone, offering

location and time-based prompts about the weather, missed calls and

appointments, as well as responding to voice commands. Elsewhere, the Japanese

company introduced its new Xperia X line of mid-range Android handsets that all

boast smart new battery technology that should extend their life and cut

charging times in a big way.



All of the above should hit the shelves within the next few months, but the show

also played host to a number of concept devices that provided a glimpse into

technology's future.



Pick of the show was the FlexEnable Smartwatch prototype, below, featuring a

super-flexible LCD display that wraps around your wrist, hinting at where

wearable tech may be heading.
