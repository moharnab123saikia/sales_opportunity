There was a time not too long ago when Apple routinely accused the makers of

competing smartphones - most notably Samsung - of copying its technology and

designs.



The release this past week of the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus show how far the

pendulum has swung in the opposite direction. These beautiful, powerful devices

are almost certainly, as Apple boasted at the launch, the best iPhones ever. But

every key feature that makes them so is cribbed from another smartphone.



Water and dust resistance? Sony's offered this for years with it's flagship

Xperia Z line and Samsung, more recently, with its Galaxy S5 and S7 phones.



Dual rear cameras on the 7 Plus? LG's G5 and X Cam as well as Huawei's P9

already have them.



Even the most controversial and widely predicted aspect, the removal of the

venerable 3.5mm headphone jack, doesn't break any new ground. Lenovo's Moto Z

and Moto Z Force and China's LeEco have gone there already.



So you could be forgiven for writing off the new iPhones as cobbled together

copycat devices. But you'd be wrong.



Apple has a long history of borrowing existing technologies and making them its

own. Before the first iPhone arrived there had been other touchscreen

smartphones. They weren't very good, though, and Apple improved on the

technology and packaged it in a device that was so well made and cleverly

marketed that it sparked off the touchscreen revolution.



Things have changed a lot since 2007 and the features Apple's copying today are

not crude and immature like the pre-iPhone touchscreens. But Apple's still a

master of combining a variety of existing technologies into a whole that's

greater than the sum of its parts.



Take the removal of the headphone jack. Cynics will say this paves the way for

Apple to up-sell a $159 (R2â[#x20ac][0/00]200) pair of wireless earbuds to

iPhone 7 owners - although they will supply a free adaptor that will let you

connect old-school wired headphones to the phones.



But dispensing with that port also allowed them to make the new iPhones

appreciably slimmer than their predecessors as well as simplifying the process

of waterproofing them.



Speaking of those pricey earbuds, they provide another example of Apple's

improving on pre-existing technology. Current versions of wireless earbuds have

two big disadvantages: Short battery life and patchy sound quality due to

connectivity issues.



Apple says it's solved both problems with its AirPods. Their claimed battery

life of five hours is impressive if it lives up to that, and can be boosted by

as much as 24 hours more by their charger-cum-carry case.



They also incorporate a new W1 chip that Apple says will deliver a "magical

experience" without the usual schlep that accompanies BlueTooth pairing and

unpairing.



Ditching the headphone jack also frees up more space for a bigger battery and

more data storage. Apple says the the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have "the

longest battery life ever" in an iPhone, with the iPhone 7 lasting two hours

more than the 6S.



Both new iPhones will be available in 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB models, marking a

welcome, if belated, realisation from Apple that 16GB is laughably inadequate

for any high-end smartphone.



The "new" feature I'm most interested in trying out is the dual lens camera.

It's only available on the bigger 7 Plus model, which packs both a telephoto and

a wide-angle lens. This, says Apple, will allow for 2x optical zoom as well as

up to 10x software zoom.



"This is the best camera ever made in any smartphone," said Apple's global

marketing honcho Phil Schiller at the launch, a boast I look forward to putting

to the test.



Apple also unveiled the next generation of its smartwatch. The Series 2 Apple

Watch has a significantly beefed-up processor and a brighter display. They're

waterproof down to 50m and have a built-in GPS so you don't need to have your

iPhone on you to track your workout.



As with the original Apple watch, the Series 2 will come in swanky Hermes

models. Another model, the Apple Watch Nike+ is aimed at runners and was

developed in partnership with Nike.



Apple watch owners will now also be able to use their devices to play PokÃ©mon

GO, including spinning PokÃ©Stops and tracking nearby PokÃ©mon, although they'll

still have to haul out their iPhones to catch them when they do appear.



Prices for the iPhone 7 start at $649 and the iPhone 7 Plus at $769 for the 32GB

models, climbing to $849 and $969 for the respective 256GB models.



The new Apple Watch, as with the previous version, is available in two case

sizes, 38mm and 42mm. Prices will start at $369, soaring to $1â[#x20ac][0/00]149

for the Hermes-branded model. The original Apple watch with an improved

dual-core chip will remain on sale from $269.



US pre-orders for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus opened on Friday, and they start

shipping there on September 16. Local iPhone fans will have to wait quite a bit

longer for it as South Africa is not on the list of countries due to receive it

within the next two months.



Still, going on previous launches, I predict it'll probably be here by

mid-October and almost certainly before year's end.



As for the price, that depends on just how battered the rand will be when the

new iPhone does land, but don't expect to pick one up for under R15 000, with

the high-end versions almost certainly setting you back well over R20 000.



Now, cheaper is a feature I wouldn't mind Apple copying. I'm not holding my

breath.
