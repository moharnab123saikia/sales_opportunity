LG's offering is easy to use and easy on the pocket

At just 25mm thick, and around half the height and breadth of an iPhone 6s Plus,

the LG 360 Cam is the smallest and lightest camera in this roundup. It is also

the cheapest here.



The 360 Cam looks like a smaller Ricoh Theta, but it comes with a protective

cover. You can remove this cover and slide it under the camera as a grip during

use.



And I recommend using the cover as a grip. Otherwise, the camera is too small to

handle.



The 360 Cam has only two buttons - a power button on the side and a shutter

release button in front (where the LG logo is sited). I found the placement of

the power button niggling though, as I tend to inadvertently press on it each

time I put back the cover.



At the bottom of the camera is a tripod mount with a microSD card slot and a

USB-C charging port protected by a small flap door.



I think having the more common micro-USB charging port would have been better.



You press and hold the power button to toggle between a 180-degree and a

360-degree image capture. Do the same for the shutter release button to switch

between photo and video capture.



If you want to see what you are shooting, you need to pair the camera with the

360 Cam Manager app (available for Android and iOS) on your smartphone.



But if you want to see what you are shooting, you need to pair the camera with

the 360 Cam Manager app (available for Android and iOS) on your smartphone.



The app also gives you more manual controls such as adjusting shooting modes,

ISO, shutter speed and white balance settings. For example, you can set white

balance within a range between 2,300 Kelvins and 7,500 Kelvins.



You can download the pictures and videos into your phone using the app, to share

them on your social-media accounts.



You need to insert the microSD card before you can take a picture, as the camera

has no internal memory. While you can see a live preview through the virtual

viewfinder, the app does not let you shoot and store images directly to your

smartphone.

The LG 360 Cam uses two 13- megapixel cameras with a 200- degree wide-angle lens

each, to deliver 16-megapixel still images and videos with resolutions of up to

2,704 x 1,440 pixels.



The still images are crisp in bright lighting conditions. But there is visible

image noise in low lighting conditions. In addition, the stitching lines can

sometimes be seen quite clearly.



Videos display some fuzziness, even in bright lighting conditions.

Verdict: The LG 360 Cam might not have the best image quality, but it is

compact, easy to use and relatively cheap. Plus, it works with both Android and

iOS devices.
