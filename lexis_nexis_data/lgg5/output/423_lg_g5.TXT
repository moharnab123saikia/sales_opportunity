It's been a busy week of unveilings in the world of tech. On top of Apple taking

the wraps off its new iPhone 7 on Wednesday and Sony at last confirming the

existence of the PlayStation 4 Pro the same evening, last weekend also saw the

annual buttons and bratwurst fest that is IFA take place in Berlin. Here's my

pick of the new gear shown off at Europe's biggest tech expo.



MOTO Z PLAY



LG may have only had modest success with the mix-and-match G5 handset, and

Google this week killed off its Project Ara concept, but Motorola nevertheless

used IFA to throw its weight behind modular mobile phones.



Much like the G5, the Z Play is a pretty solid high-end smartphone in its own

right that has interchangeable back plates.



These allow you to clip on different attachments called Moto Mods, with the

Lenovo-owned firm showing off a smartlooking lens add-on with a 10x optical zoom

built by German optics specialist Hasselblad.



WELT SMART BELT



First unveiled at CES in Las Vegas in January, Samsung spin-off firm Welt used

IFA to announce a kickstarter campaign for its waistline-tracking smart belt.



Pledge $119 and, just in time for those post-Christmas diets, you should get

your hands on the discreet wearable which also tracks your eating habits, step

counts and the time you spend sitting.



TOMTOM TOUCH



With dedicated satnavs being increasingly eclipsed by smartphone apps, Dutch

specialist TomTom has been moving towards making fitness trackers. Its latest is

the Touch, which has the USP of being able to display body fat calculations.

Pressing a touch-sensitive button sends a small electrical current through your

body which lets the wearable measure the balance between muscle mass and fat.



While we are yet to see how accurate and reliable these stats are, the

innovative feature certainly one-ups rivals such as Fitbit.



SONY XPERIA XZ



Sony rustled up a fair bit of excitement from phone fans by giving a debut to

its new flagship handset at IFA. With a greater focus on its photography

features than predecessor the Xperia X, the Xperia XZ has a 23mp sensor and

improved white balance performance. It also has fancy five-axis image

stabilisation technology which will help stop blurry videos, is fully waterproof

and has the added promise of an early update to Google's latest Android Nougat

operating system.



RAZOR STARGAZER WEBCAM



You may wonder what a seemingly humble webcam is doing in our top 10 picks, but

this gamer-focused piece of kit was a major talking point at the show.



Able to shoot at 720p at 60fps or 1080p at 30fps, it features Intel's RealSense

technology, allowing you to remove and switch backgrounds without the need for a

green screen. On top of that it can also work as a 3D scanner, allowing you to,

amongst other things, scan your face and directly port it into game worlds. It

also boasts built-in noise cancellation as well as Kinect-style gesture/facial

recognition.



SONY ACER PREDATOR 21 X



If you were to make an ultimate wish list for stuff you wanted from a top-spec

gaming laptop, it'd probably read like the Acer Predator 21 X's spec sheet.



It's the most insane laptop we've seen.



For starters, it has a 21-inch curved display, while inside it's packing not

one, but two top-of-the-line Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 desktop-class graphics

cards. Add a transforming numberpad/ touchpad and you've got the ultimate gaming

laptop on your hands - and it will likely cost the world when it launches in

2017.



PHILIPS OLED 901F



Philips's first foray into OLED TV territory is a blinder. A rich 4K panel for

ultra-high definition movie playback, it has a sleek design that lets this

55-inch screen slip into surroundings.



That is, until you turn it on, at which point your living room bursts into

colour.



That's because Philips has packed its Ambilight technology into the display,

projecting colours matching the on-screen action onto the walls behind to fully

immerse the viewer in the action.



Throw in Android TV smart functionality and it's a winner.



LENOVO YOGA BOOK



It's hard to find anything truly unique in the world of consumer tech these days

but Lenovo's Yoga Book certainly is.



The hybrid laptop/tablet taken to its logical conclusion, it swaps out the

physical keyboard for another capacitive touch display, essentially leaving you

with a dual-screened device.



While full-size touch keys with haptic feedback may take some getting used to

for traditional keyboard warriors, Lenovo is also throwing in a top-notch stylus

too, making this as much a digital notepad or art device as a spreadsheet

smasher.



Rumours suggest the Yoga Book will launch (in both Windows 10 and Android

flavours) at a more affordable price than you may think.



SAMSUNG GEAR S3 CLASSIC



The smartwatch revolution still isn't in full swing, but that's not stopping

Samsung from trying.



Running the company's own Tizen OS, the 1.3-inch screen Gear S3 Classic offers

an always-on look at the watch face through a Super AMOLED screen.



A rotating bezel lets you dive into app options, while a speedometer and

altimeter join the fitness-tracking sensors.



Samsung's also made the Gear S3 Frontier with a rugged build and LTE

connectivity for smartphone-free watch smarts.



PANASONIC DMP-UB700 4K BLU-RAY PLAYER



It may not be much to look at but the DMPUB700 has a killer feature - its price

tag.



Panasonic's latest 4K Blu-ray player costs a relatively affordable Â£400, putting

4K disc playback within reach of even the casual movie fan.



Future-proofed by conforming to the new "Ultra HD Premium" specification, it has

twin HDMI ports for audio passthrough, and online connectivity for streaming in

the latest HDR shows and movies from Netflix.
