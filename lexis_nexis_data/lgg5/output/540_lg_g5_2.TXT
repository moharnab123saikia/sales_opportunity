smartphone. Can it make a difference?

HTC seems to be on its toes for its latest flagship smartphone the HTC 10. The
Taiwanese company has scheduled a launch event for its HTC 10 smartphone in
India on 26 May. HTC has sent invites to the media and possibly the smartphones
should arrive in stores very soon.

While other smartphones giants like LG started pre-order its G5 flagship, so it
makes a lot of "sense" if HTC steps in quickly and launches its M10 in a
hardware craving market. Chinese smartphone makers like Xiaomi already has an
edge by launching its Qualcomm Snapdragon 820-powered Mi 5.

The HTC 10 comes with some powerful and up to date hardware. Powered with a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset, it is paired with 4GB RAM and 32GB or 64GB
internal storage options, augmented with expandable storage up to 2TB via a
microSD card slot.

The HTC 10 packs in 12MP (UltraPixel) primary camera unit with extensive
features like an f/1.8 aperture, laser AF and IOS along with a dual LED flash.
On the front, we have a 5MP camera unit that also comes with an f/1.8 aperture,
AF, including IOS. HTC 10 also has a screen flash feature for selfies shot in
the low light. Boom sound is slightly improved and on the audio part, a woofer
and tweeter system is included.

Overall the device is one of the best in class. Pricing and availability will be
revealed at the event, but the only thing known is that the HTC 10 is making its
way to India on 26th May and will come around a price bracket of INR 55,000.
