HTC is back with top notch hardware packaged in a beautifully designed flagship

smartphone. Can it make a difference?



HTC seems to be on its toes for its latest flagship smartphone the HTC 10. The

Taiwanese company has scheduled a launch event for its HTC 10 smartphone in

India on 26 May. HTC has sent invites to the media and possibly the smartphones

should arrive in stores very soon.



While other smartphones giants like LG started pre-order its G5 flagship, so it

makes a lot of "sense" if HTC steps in quickly and launches its M10 in a

hardware craving market. Chinese smartphone makers like Xiaomi already has an

edge by launching its Qualcomm Snapdragon 820-powered Mi 5.



The HTC 10 comes with some powerful and up to date hardware. Powered with a

Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset, it is paired with 4GB RAM and 32GB or 64GB

internal storage options, augmented with expandable storage up to 2TB via a

microSD card slot.



The HTC 10 packs in 12MP (UltraPixel) primary camera unit with extensive

features like an f/1.8 aperture, laser AF and IOS along with a dual LED flash.

On the front, we have a 5MP camera unit that also comes with an f/1.8 aperture,

AF, including IOS. HTC 10 also has a screen flash feature for selfies shot in

the low light. Boom sound is slightly improved and on the audio part, a woofer

and tweeter system is included.



Overall the device is one of the best in class. Pricing and availability will be

revealed at the event, but the only thing known is that the HTC 10 is making its

way to India on 26th May and will come around a price bracket of INR 55,000.
