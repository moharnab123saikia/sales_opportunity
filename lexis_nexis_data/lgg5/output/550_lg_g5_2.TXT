Qualcomm's Quick Charge technology came as a savior for charging or daily
devices, and the latest edition, Quick Charge 3.0, is debuting with some of the
latest phones. While phones like the LG G5 with a Snapdragon 820 supports Quick
Charge 3.0, Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge fans may not be so lucky.

Samsung's latest Fast Charging capabilities on its flagships S7 and S7 Edge are
maxed out at Quick Charge 2.0 speeds, which is just the same as the earlier
generation of Galaxy phones, as they are all built with the same charging specs.
The main reason behind it the fact that Samsung is using two different
processors in the Samsung S7 and S7 Edge around the world, which does not have
the same charging capacities. While the Galaxy S7 models sold in few regions
like the US come with the Snapdragon 820 which is capable of Quick Charge 3.0, a
majority of the regions run on the proprietary Exynos 8 processor, which does
not support Quick Charge 3.0. Therefore, to keep it consistent, all the phones
are kept on the same speed of Quick Charge 2.0.

However, Quick Charge 2.0 is not all that slow as compared to the Quick Charge
3.0. You can still charge a good amount to the battery within 15 minutes with
the right charger or power bank, or get even faster charging by using one of
Samsung's Fast Charge Qi wireless chargers. So, to be honest, Samsung S7 users
are not missing out on much.
