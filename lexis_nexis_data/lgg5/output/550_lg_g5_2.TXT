Samsung S7 and S7 Edge will not support Quick Charging 3.0

Qualcomm's Quick Charge technology came as a savior for charging or daily

devices, and the latest edition, Quick Charge 3.0, is debuting with some of the

latest phones. While phones like the LG G5 with a Snapdragon 820 supports Quick

Charge 3.0, Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge fans may not be so lucky.



Samsung's latest Fast Charging capabilities on its flagships S7 and S7 Edge are

maxed out at Quick Charge 2.0 speeds, which is just the same as the earlier

generation of Galaxy phones, as they are all built with the same charging specs.

The main reason behind it the fact that Samsung is using two different

processors in the Samsung S7 and S7 Edge around the world, which does not have

the same charging capacities. While the Galaxy S7 models sold in few regions

like the US come with the Snapdragon 820 which is capable of Quick Charge 3.0, a

majority of the regions run on the proprietary Exynos 8 processor, which does

not support Quick Charge 3.0. Therefore, to keep it consistent, all the phones

are kept on the same speed of Quick Charge 2.0.



However, Quick Charge 2.0 is not all that slow as compared to the Quick Charge

3.0. You can still charge a good amount to the battery within 15 minutes with

the right charger or power bank, or get even faster charging by using one of

Samsung's Fast Charge Qi wireless chargers. So, to be honest, Samsung S7 users

are not missing out on much.
