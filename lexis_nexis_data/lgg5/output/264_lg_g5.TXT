LG To Say Goodbye For Modular Accessories For G6?

Doing so may result in losing customersa trust, especially those who bought G5

for love of modular accessories!



In a very unlikely decision, the South Korean company LG seems to have bid a

farewell to the modular accessories for its upcoming flagship smartphone, the

G6, which is expected to be launched in 2017. The decision comes with a fact

that the recently launched smartphone, G5's modular accessories couldn't enter

the hearts of its customers.



The reason may be simple - people may not be interested in such gimmicks and are

looking for best features inside a smartphone itself, rather than adding on

expensive accessories to them.



We all know that G5 has not actually been as successful as the company had

guessed it would be. And, this may be a sole responsibility of the modular

system that was not pretty much of a click-n-go type! Users had to, in-fact,

remove the smartphone's battery when ever they had to connect an accessory. This

in-fact forced users to restart their phone every time they had to plus in a

mod!



Having said this, a source also cites that the company is internally worried

from withdrawing the strategy within just a year since its implementation. With

modular accessories going off-route soon, the company may even lose its

customers' trust, especially those who bought the G5 simply because of the

modular accessories.



However, the report also claims to soon expect the exact outline of G6

smartphone, which may give us a better understanding.
