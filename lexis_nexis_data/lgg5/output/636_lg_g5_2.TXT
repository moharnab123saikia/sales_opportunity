3D Touch to come to many other Android phones

It is pretty common to see that when one phone maker comes out with an

innovative feature that is quite the success, other phone makers will follow,

and this time it's the 3D Touch feature seen from the latest iPhones.



According to a report on GizmoChina, many China based Android phone makers are

reportedly working on their own iteration of the of the famed 3D Touch feature.

Phone makers such as Xiaomi, Meizum, Oppo and Vivo all have their own versions

of the technology in the pipelines for their upcoming devices. It is rumored

that the next Google Nexus phone, which will be made by HTC will also have a

similar pressure sensitive display.



The pressure sensitive display was one of the key features seen on the latest

iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which allows users to press harder on the screen to

access extra functions. The technology has already been mimicked on the Huawei

Mate S.



Variable force sensing technology is already available to phone manufacturers at

the moment, however it is a question of how quickly they can implement this into

their devices, while still staying within a reasonable price bracket. The 3D

Touch style technology hasn't made its way to the new Samsung Galaxy S7 or LG

G5, however, once the Chinese manufacturers get it done it would not be

surprising if other major companies follow suit.
