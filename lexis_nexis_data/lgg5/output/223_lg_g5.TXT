NEW DELHI: The wholly-owned Indian subsidiary of South Korea's LG Electronics

has launched its latest smartphone, LG X Cam in India. Priced at INR 19,990, the

X Cam has a dual camera similar to LG G5, which has a 120-degree wide angle lens

to complement the standard lens. The 13MP standard angle lens and the 5MP wide

angle camera on the rear of the X cam delivers as wide a field of view similar

to the human eye, i.e. it can capture 53% more area than the traditional cameras

on the smartphones.



The X cam offers Pop-out-Picture feature, which combines the two images taken

with the standard and wide angle lenses to create a picture-in-a-frame effect.

Additionally, the panorama view automatically scrolls a wide image instead of a

static image and this feature also allows users to add a caption or a byline

after taking a photo.



Commenting on this launch, Amit Gujral, Marketing Head - Mobiles, LG India said,

"With X Cam, we are giving consumers a dual camera smartphone at a reasonable

price point. We are sure that the Indian consumers will like the very rare in

smartphones, 'wide angle' feature, something that has been inherited from our

premium smartphone LG G5. This 'wide angle' photography would be a unique

experience in this segment and consumers shall surely embrace this new

experience, which otherwise is possible only with nature gifted eyes."
