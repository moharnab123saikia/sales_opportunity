NEW DELHI: Recently, it was found that a bug named QuadRooter puts almost 1

billion Android handsets at risk. The vulnerability, discovered by security

company Check Point, is said to give hackers access to user's personal

information by remotely rooting the smartphones. According to the company, the

security bug affects devices with Qualcomm chips, which are installed into

devices during the manufacturing process.



The flaw includes four vulnerabilities, any of which can be used by hackers to

take control of a smartphone. Now, Google has reportedly given its stance on the

matter claiming that the threat is not as serious as it has been projected.



The search giant, as reported by Tech Insider, has said that out of the

aforementioned four vulnerabilities it has fixed three issues as a part of the

August Android OS security update. The fourth vulnerability will be fixed in

September's security update.



Although Google is already sending out fixes for the bug, it still remains

unlikely that all the 900 million smartphones would receive the update. Google

adds that its 'Verify Apps' feature would also be ruling out the malicious apps.

The feature will scan the apps before installing them on the handset. Verify

Apps is switched on by default.



However, those users who have older versions of Android OS running on their

handsets (older than Jelly Bean) would have to manually activate the 'Verify

Apps' feature.



The QuadRooter vulnerability affects smartphone drivers which control

communication between the various chipset components. Check Point recommends

users to download and install the latest Android updates as soon as they become

available, avoid side-loading apk files, read app permission requests carefully

while installing apps and more.



Some of the latest smartphones that are said to be vulnerable to QuadRooter are

Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge , OnePlus 3, Google Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus

6P, LG G4, LG G5 , LG V10, OnePlus One, OnePlus 2, OnePlus 3 and more.
