With LG having major leaks of the G5 weeks ahead of the MWC 2016, you would
think that LG is out of things to announce.

LG recently announced two brand new phones, the LG X Cam and LG X Screen, which
represent a new design for its mid-range handsets. The new phones come with
relatively large displays of around 5 inches and a couple of signature features
from the LG flagship phones. The X Cam will come with dual cameras on the back,
similar to the G5, and a 5.2 inch screen with 3D Bending Glass and a curved
finish.

The X Screen, bears more of a resemblance to the LG V10, with a second screen at
the top of the phone. This 1.76 inch always on display expands on the 4.93 inch
HD screen, which makes it easy to make shortcuts to frequent apps, and always
see the time, date and notifications, without coming in the way of the main
display.

There is still more to be announced of the cheaper LG phones, such as its price
and other features. We can expect more as LG referred to these phones as
"premium features without the premium price." These phones will be there at MWC
2016, but there is still no word on its official release date.
