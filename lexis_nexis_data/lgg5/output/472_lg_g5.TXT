S. Korean, Chinese smartphones to clash at MWC '



LENGTH: 189 words





Desperate to expand their global presence, South Korean and Chinese smartphone

makers are likely to fight a pitched battle to steal the show at the world's

largest tech exhibition in Spain next week, industry watchers said Tuesday.



The four-day Mobile World Congress (MWC) is slated to kick off in Barcelona next

Monday, showcasing the latest mobile gadgets and next-generation technologies,

and bringing together some 100,000 CEOs and officials from nearly 2,000 tech

companies across the globe.



LG Electronics Inc. will be the first to introduce a new flagship smartphone,

the G5, which is expected to come with an improved design and a second-display

feature as introduced in the V10 model last year.



The device is also anticipated to be slightly smaller by having a 5.3-inch

display, compared with its 5.5-inch predecessor, although others say that the

second display will make it comparatively bigger.



Samsung Electronics Co. also plans to showcase the presumed Galaxy S7 hours

later, which is widely expected to come with improved features, including a

pressure-sensitive display, similar to "3D Touch" promoted by Apple Inc.
