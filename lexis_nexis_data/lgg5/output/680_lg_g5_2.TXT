a mere 30 minute charge.

HTC's M10 is the first out in Ireland to make use of so-called Quick Charge 3
technology that lets it suck up power fast and also use less.

Users can get the battery half full - enough for a day - in half an hour. It
fully charges for two days use in 90 minutes.

Stuart Miles, founder of technology website www.Pocket-lint.co.uk, said:
"Battery life is really important for many users but improvements in battery
efficiency are slower than most of us would like.

"So companies are saying if you cannot make it last longer lets make it charge
quicker.

"Most of us have access to a power socket at some point in the day and if it
only takes half an hour for a day's charge that's a really appealing selling
point."

A giant battery and clever "power management" that shuts off power hungry apps
when not needed help keep it going longer too.

The handset is the latest refresh of the big phone firms' flagship devices - as
they try to catch up with Apple's iPhone.

All are coming up with new features to stand out. HTC's M10, costing around
(EURO)629 or about (EURO)45 a month on contract, was unveiled on Tuesday and
goes on sale early May. Huawei's P9 was revealed last Wednesday and has two
lenses for better pics.

Samsung's Galaxy S7 - with a curved screen and waterproof feature - hit shops in
mid-March.

And LG's "modular" G5 - where users can replace parts for specific purposes -
went on sale on Friday.
