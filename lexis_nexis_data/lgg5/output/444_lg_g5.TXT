LENGTH: 267 words





LG Electronics said Tuesday its car parts business division swung to a profit in

the fourth quarter for the first time since it started releasing its separate

earnings last year.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]The company said the Vehicle Component division, which produces

parts for automotive infotainment systems, posted 520.4 billion won ($432

million) in sales and 9.7 billion won in operating profits in the

October-December period.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]LG established the division in 2013 to tap deeper into the

lucrative market for futuristic vehicles such as full-electric vehicles and

self-driving cars. Its local rival Samsung launched a similar team in December.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]The Korean tech giant restored profitability across its

business divisions. Its fourth-quarter profits surged 26.8 percent to 349

billion won from a year ago. Sales stood at 14.5 trillion won, down 4.7 percent

on-year.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Largely buoyed by increased sales of more profitable organic

light emitting diode or OLED TVs, the Home Entertainment business division's

operating profits soared to 109.2 billion won from last year's 2.1 billion won.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]The mobile business division, which suffered 77.6 billion

profit losses in the third quarter, swung to a profit of 68.1 billion won in the

fourth quarter.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]LG sold 15.3 million smartphones in the quarter, of which LTE

phones made up a record 10.8 million units.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]In Tuesday's conference call, the company said it will launch

two premium smartphones this year, including its flagship G5 in March, while

diversifying budget phone lineups.
