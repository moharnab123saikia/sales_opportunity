As we move into the unveiling of HTC 10, here is a roundup of things that you

should know before the smartphone gets announced, along with what the company

must do in order for it to succeed



LENGTH: 830  words





HTC 10 has a lot of hype being created about it, and rightly so, since it will

take the top spot against LG G5 and Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 edge as one of

the reigning Android smartphones of 2016. There are several features the device

is expected to come shipped with, and while we have knowledge regarding the

hardware specifications, we want to dive further into how HTC could make this

smartphone one of 2016's most desired ones.



HTC 10 hardware specification breakdown first



The thing with smartphones is that with a small number of high-end chipset

makers, it is relatively easy to tell what is going to be present inside

upcoming flagships like HTC 10. We know majority of manufacturers will opt for

Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820. While Exynos 8890 is also a viable option, we have

never seen HTC create a partnership with Samsung for its mobile SoCs and we do

not end up seeing that in the foreseeable future as well.



Chipset and processor



That being said, HTC 10 will come with a Snapdragon 820. Processed under the

advanced 14nm FinFET technology, Snapdragon 820 might only feature a quad-core

processor, but Apple's dual-core chipsets are the perfect example why the number

of cores are not sufficient enough to justify a performance boost.



Snapdragon 820 will come running the following quad-core based on Qualcomm's

custom developed Kyro processor:



Dual-core 2.15GHz and dual-core 1.6GHz



Unlike some smartphone models out there (most notably Xiaomi Mi5), we do not

believe that HTC 10 will come in different processor models, because let us

honest, it confuses the average consumer and HTC will have a ton of unsold

inventory if it decides to release different models of the same handset.

Besides, the company is in a spot of bother right now, so upping its smartphone

sales would be the best course of action, which we believe would be to release a

single model running the processor at its highest possible frequency.



RAM and internal storage options



Complementing the processor is 4GB of RAM. This amount has become quite common

in expensive Android flagships, and HTC 10 will be looking to equal the amount

present in both Galaxy S6 and LG G5. While the software ultimately determines

how much RAM should be allocated to applications, having more of it eventually

leads to more freedom of control from your smartphone. You obviously want to

fire up apps constantly without feeling that the handset has slowed down due to

high RAM usage. For now, 4GB RAM is definitely the sweet spot for mobile devices

out there but optimizing the custom interface is also not a bad idea, which is a

topic we will get to right at the end.



With One M9, HTC limited the internal storage to 32GB, but it did feature a

microSD card slot with a capacity limit of 200GB. With the upcoming 10, internal

storage could be provided in two separate models; a 32GB one and a 64GB one,

while an external storage feature could be retained up to 200GB. This smartphone

could use the UFS 2.0 as being the standard for its internal storage. Universal

Flash Storage 2.0, or UFS 2.0, is faster than the eMMC (embedded memory card)

standard that was present in devices like Huawei Mate 8, and the image given

below properly summarizes the speed differences between the two standards.



In short, HTC 10's internal storage could be packing faster data transfer speeds

under its belt, but storage flexibility in a smartphone is a very important

feature that companies overlook often and for HTC's sake, we hope that they do

not lock the device down.



Screen size, resolution, battery capacity and other features



For the longest time ever, HTC has never gone beyond the 1080p mark in its

phones, but it is possible that with the announcement of 10, it could all change

very soon. HTC 10 could come with a 5.2 inch screen and a 1440p display. The

results would equal a very crisp display with a high PPI value that will look

absolutely stunning, if not for one major disadvantage, the battery life. QHD

displays rapidly decrease battery life and it is up to HTC to pack in a larger

battery inside its hood. Battery technology has not improved ever since the

introduction of lithium ion and polymer cells so the only ace up HTC's sleeve is

to pack in a larger cell for increased 'screen on' time.



With One M9 coming with a 2,840mAh battery, we are obviously expecting HTC to

deliver well on this front. Before we point this out, all the nay-sayers who

believe that decreasing the smartphone's overall thickness cannot possibly allow

the phone to house a larger battery. Well, to remove your doubt, Samsung did it

with its Galaxy S7. The high-end mobile phone features a 3,000mAh battery and is

400mAh higher than Galaxy S6, while being 1mm thinner. So if Samsung can make

these adjustments, then so can HTC.
