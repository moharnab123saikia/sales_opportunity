ZOOMLITE SET OF FOUR PACKING CUBES



$49.95. Zoomlite has released their handy packing cube set in a bright shade of

pink. Ideal for compressing bulky garments, grouping smalls or sectioning off a

suitcase, these cubes feature breathable mesh for visibility and can be just

picked up out of luggage and put in hotel room drawers for easy unpacking.

primary rear camera has a 16MP 78-degree lens, with Optical Image Stabilisation,

and a 135-degree rear wide angle camera with a 135-degree field of view. See lg.
