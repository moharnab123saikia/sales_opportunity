One of the handsets which grabbed the spotlight at the Mobile World Congress

(MWC) 2016 trade show in Barcelona, Spain, on Sunday, was South Korean device

maker LG's new flagship handset --- G5.



The LG G5 was, by far, the most innovative new flagship device to be introduced

at the trade show this year. The G5 handset features a complete redesign of the

current LG flagship, the G4. Boasting an all-metal design, the newly-unveiled G5

is 159-gram handset which measures 149.4 x 73.9 x 7.7 mm.



The LG G5 is scheduled to hit the US markets in April; and will be available

from Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and Best Buy. LG will offer four color options for

the handset --- Silver, Gold, Titan, and Pink.



Some of its most impressive specifications include a 5.3-inch IPS LCD QHD

'Always-On' display with 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution; Qualcomm's newest

Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor; 4GB of RAM; a removable 2,800 mAh battery;

and 32GB of onboard storage capacity, which can be expanded to 200GB via a

microUSB card. The handset runs the Android OS 6.0 'Marshmallow' version; and is

equipped with a 16-megapixel main rear camera; and an 8-megapixel front-facing

camera.



The most distinguishing feature of the G5 is that it enables users to benefit

from different 'modules' which can be used for the handset by sliding out its

battery. Among the modules available for use in G5, one of the modules adds a

bigger battery and camera controls; while another one offers better sound

quality.
