Meet the processor that's going to power many of this year's flagship mobile

devices



Qualcomm has unveiled the successor to the Snapdragon 820--the Snapdragon 821.

This new mobile platform is said to deliver faster speed, improved power

savings, and greater multitasking performance.



Currently, the Snapdragon 820 powers some of the most feature-rich smartphones

including Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, Xiaomi Mi 5, LG G5, HTC 10,

LeEco LeMax 2, and Sony Xperia X.



Qualcomm mentioned, "We're excited to tell you more about just how the

Snapdragon 821 will help set a new bar for smartphones, tablets, mobile VR head

mounted displays and other new devices. You can expect commercial devices

powered by the 821 in the second half of 2016."



The company states that the Snapdragon 821 is engineered to deliver a 10 percent

performance increase over its predecessor, and continues to be based on their

Kryo quad-core CPU that can now reach clock speeds of up to 2.4GHz. Also the 821

contains a slightly faster Adreno 530 GPU compared to the 820--from 624MHz to

650MHz, promising better graphics ability.



The speed of the chips used in various implementations of the 821 across devices

will differ, based on the strategies of the respective manufacturers--some will

be clocked lower for better battery life while others that are skewed toward

gaming may be set to run at their full potential. Also, the company stated that

the 820 will continue to be used in upcoming phones, alongside its successor.



The Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe will be the first smartphone to be based on Snapdragon

821 platform, and Google's upcoming flagship Nexus is rumored to be based on it

as well.
