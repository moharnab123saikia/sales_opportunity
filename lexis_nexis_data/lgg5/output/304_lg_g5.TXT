A premium smartphone is not easy to do, and it's even harder to win in this

price-band. The reigning smartphone vendors for the last two years have been

Apple and Samsung. And unlike Samsung's wide portfolio, Apple is all about

premium phones.



For users who are willing to pay above $500 or R40,000+ for a smartphone,

there's now a standard set of expectations: exceptional camera, a great-design,

battery that lasts all day, and yes performance and consistency that few can

match. There are very few players that can tick all the right boxes, especially

that last bit and maybe even give you something extra. HTC, which used to be one

of the top smartphone players in the world, seems to be refocusing on the

premium segment where it had some grip earlier. The latest flagship is HTC 10,

which on paper ticks all the right boxes that a premium phone should. At

R52,990, HTC makes its clear: This flagship will take on S7 edge, LG G5 and the

Apple iPhone 6s. But will HTC 10 be the company's saviour? Here's our review.



What is good?



Design in a premium smartphone matters and as I have pointed out HTC 10 delivers

on this front. What helps the HTC 10 is the



5.2-inch 2K display, which is quite bright and crisp. You should not have any

trouble using this one in bright sunlight either. HTC also gone for a cleaner

UI, which is closer to stock Android. Personally, I was never fond of HTC Sense

UI, and this pared down version works better for me. All those extra apps are

now gone.



BlinkFeed is still accessible when you swipe right on the screen and you can

customise the content you want to receive there. However, Android M features

like Permissions, Google Now on Tap, etc are easily accessible, and it's good to

see HTC has not decided to hide them somewhere else. Google Photos is the

default Gallery app on this one.



The overall performance of the phone is smooth and flawless. In my tests, HTC 10

came in the top ten in Antutu Benchmarks scoring 132082, putting it just below

S7 edge, iPhone 6s, and above the G5. In GeekBench it scored 4953 in multi-core

comparison. Benchmarks aside, the HTC 10 doesn't stutter or lag and can handle

pretty much anything you throw at it.



Camera is where HTC 10 really shines, because this one delivers some stunning

shots. Low-light shots or whether you are out shooting during the day, HTC 10's

camera is top-notch. It is fast, there's no shutter lag and really delivers on

the promise of what a premium smartphone's camera should offer.



HTC 10's battery is another strong suit of this phone and should last 10-12

hours with heavy to moderate usage. At one particular event, HTC 10 was down to

15% with 4G on and I still used it to tweet, take pictures till the battery was

at 4%.



HTC's BoomSound technology makes audio on this phone quite an experience. I

listen to a lot of music on my phone, pretty much all the time and often I tend

to put the volume quite high, which is not really ideal. With HTC 10, I felt I

could keep the volume levels at minimal and it still sounds loud enough. On the

4G, connectivity front I faced no issues either.



What is not so good?



The major problem I had with HTC 10 was over-heating. It got really warm,

especially when I was using the camera outside, and that resulted in the battery

draining faster. At one point it was too hot to hold or even put inside my jeans

pocket. HTC might have pared down HTC Sense, but this one still requires you to

download Google Keyboard. The native Sangam IME keyboard was quite a pain to use

and didn't do much for my accuracy.



Verdict



We know HTC is struggling in the premium smartphone market. It wants to regain

the lost space, and HTC 10 is as good a bet as any to do that. But I felt what's

missing was that extra factor to give this phone the edge, to justify the

R50,000 plus price tag. HTC 10 doesn't disappoint on any crucial aspect. But the

problem for HTC is there are other options in the market, offering a similar

experience that comes very close.



For HTC 10 the challenge is not convincing users it is a great phone, the

challenge is the pricing.
