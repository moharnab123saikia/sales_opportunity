New Delhi, July 28 -- LG Electronics Inc. says its second-quarter net income

jumped 19 percent thanks to strong sales of high-end TVs and home appliances

that outweighed another quarterly loss in its handset business.



The South Korean company said Thursday its April-June earnings came in at 268.51

billion won ($238.59 million), on sales of 14 trillion won ($12.44 billion).



LG said its TV and home appliance divisions reported the strongest results in

the company's history.



But its mobile phone division was in the red for a fifth straight quarter

despite the company's ambitious launch of the G5 smartphones.



Initially, the G5 received positive reviews with its modular designs that

feature a bottom that pops out and can be swapped in with other hardware. But LG

failed to increase sales of flagship phones.
