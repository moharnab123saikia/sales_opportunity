NEW DELHI: Intel Security has announced McAfee Mobile Security will be

pre-installed on the latest smartphone from LG Electronics, the LG G5, to enable

users to connect with more confidence.



This extends an existing agreement whereby LG Electronics selected McAfee Mobile

Security to help protect against security threats and provide theft protection

for its G4 smartphone. With the pre-installed application, LG G5 users will

enjoy antivirus and anti-theft benefits as well as enhanced privacy settings,

enabling them to experience the mobile world with greater confidence.



"As we become increasingly connected, mobile devices are the tip of the spear

for new hacking methods. Intel Security's Mobile Threat Report recently found

that three million mobile devices were affected by malware solely through mobile

app stores over the past six months," the statement said.



Additionally, Intel Security found that in Q4 2015 mobile malware samples

increased 24 percent compared to Q3 2015, reinforcing the need for consumers to

have appropriate protection to help protect their devices and digital lives.



"McAfee Mobile Security offers award-winning protection for mobile devices, so

it's no surprise that smartphone manufacturer LG chose it to help protect its G4

and now G5 smartphones," said John Giamatteo, corporate vice president at Intel

Security.



"As LG's customers turn to mobile devices and mobile applications to enrich

their lives, we will offer them innovative solutions to help protect their

devices, their digital lives and allow them to connect to the Internet more

securely and with confidence," said Giamatteo.
