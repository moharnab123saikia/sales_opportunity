recorded its biggest public finance surplus for January since 2008.

The Office for National Statistics said the Government managed to raise £11.2
billion more than it spent in January, as it rode high on strong tax receipts.

The improved performance means Government borrowing was £66.5 billion for the
financial year between April 2015 and January, down £10.6 billion over the same
period before.

The Government counts on January as a strong month for tax receipts, as it is
when many companies and individuals pay their taxes.

But despite the boost, Chancellor George Osborne remains under pressure to meet
his borrowing targets.
