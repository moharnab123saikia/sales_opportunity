iPhone 7 battery fail: Apple's latest handset finishes LAST in independent

battery life test;

Apple claims the iPhone 7 lasts two hours longer than the iPhone 6s - but is it

long enough?

Apple may claim that its iPhone 7 has "the best battery life ever on an iPhone",

but sometimes your best just isn't good enough.



According to tests by consumer watchdog Which? , the battery on the iPhone 7

doesn't last anywhere near as long as its three major Android rivals - the

Samsung Galaxy S7, HTC 10 and LG G5.



All four phones were put through their paces, first making a continuous call

over 3G until the battery ran out, and then accessing a regularly updating web

page over 3G.



In the interest of fairness, Which? ensured that the signal strength on each

phone was consistent, the screen brightness was set at the same level, and each

phone had been fully discharged and then charged before testing.



On the call test, the iPhone 7's battery reportedly lasted 712 minutes - less

than half the amount of time as the Samsung Galaxy S7, which lasted 1,492

minutes. The LG G5 lasted 1,579 minutes, and the HTC 10 lasted an incredible

1,859 minutes.



When it came to internet browsing time, the results were a lot closer - but the

iPhone 7 still came bottom.



The 615 minutes of battery life offered by the iPhone 7 is 25 minutes less than

its nearest rival, the LG G5, and 175 minutes less than the top-performing HTC

10.



In fact, the HTC 10's 3G internet browsing time was even longer than the iPhone

7's 3G call time... It doesn't make for pretty reading for Apple.



Which? said the main reason for the iPhone 7's poor battery life was its

comparatively tiny battery cell - measured in milliampere hours (mAh).



"The iPhone 7 has a 1,960mAh battery, whilst the HTC 10 has a 3,000mAh battery:

it should hardly be surprising that one battery nearly half the size of another

offers roughly half as much charge," it said.



This is likely to offer little solace to people who have forked out Â£599 and up

for a brand spanking new iPhone 7.



However, as Which? points out, battery life isn't everything when it comes to

picking the best phone. You can read our full review of the iPhone 7 here .
