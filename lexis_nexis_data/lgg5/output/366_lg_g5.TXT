NEW DELHI: LG is confirmed to launch its V20 smartphone in September. While

there is nothing much known about the specifications of the smartphone, final

renders of the LG V20 were revealed by Android Authority. The smartphone will

house dual-rear cameras with dual-tone LED Flash.



The renders reveal that rear panel of the LG V20 will be similar to the flagship

LG G5 and will also house fingerprint scanner.This smartphone will reportedly be

LG's first handset to run the latest Android Nougat operating system. LG will

most likely power the handset with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. The V20

will succeed the V10.To recall, the LG V10 was launched last year in October. It

features another screen above the main 5.7-inch display. The second display can

stay on to display weather, time and date when the main display is turned off.

the main screen to watch a video.Some of the features included in the V10 are

Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, 16MP rear

camera, 5MP front-facing camera, and 3,000mAh battery.The company had recently

launched its X Screen smartphone in India at a price of Rs 12,990. And as the

name suggests, LG X screen seems to have screen as its 'special' feature. LG X

Screen boasts of dual-display. The handset has a 4.93-inch primary display and a

secondary 'Always-on' screen measuring 1.76-inch, similar to the one in LG's
