Sure the Samsung Note7 is no longer in the market, but looks like some of its
features may make it to other devices. This time it is the iris scanner feature,
which might be seen in the upcoming LG G6.

Recent rumors suggest that LG's upcoming flagship, the LG G6 might come with a
built in iris scanner. Reports suggest that LG Innotek, the components wing of
LG, is currently working on an iris recognition module. Although this does not
mean the feature could come to the G6, the chances are high especially since the
G5 didnt have it and this would be a way to one-up the predecessor.

The function might be the same, but the module might be a bit different when
compared to the module seen on the Note7. The one on the Note7 packed an iris
scanner that relied on a dedicated camera to cast a gaze over the user's eyes as
well a separate selfie snapper. On the other hand LG's design will fuse two
components into one, with a filter calling up one function over the other, thus
saving space resulting in a slimmer, sleek phone.

We still dont know when the LG G6 will come out to customers, but a launch in
April 2017 is a safe bet. There are chances it can be priced around $650.
