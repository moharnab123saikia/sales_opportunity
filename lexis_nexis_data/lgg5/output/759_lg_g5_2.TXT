The standout products of 2005



STEPHEN FENECH highlights the standout gadgets and must-have products of 2005.



IT'S been quite a year. And although 2005 seems to have gone by in the blink of

an eye, a year is a long time in the technology industry. There have been many

rapid developments and improvements, across all categories from home

entertainment and computers to digital imaging, mobile telephones and even

gaming.



Digital Life has been fortunate enough to take a look at most of these devices

and we were impressed by a number of products.



Here's a look at some of the products which caught our eye in 2005.





Home entertainment



The home theatre available today is vastly different to that of 12 months ago.

Prices have continued to drop while the quality and features have improved.



There aren't too many industries which boast a similar movement in their

respective markets.



The standout products in this category have been the display devices.



Plasma has still kept its nose ahead of LCD, but it is the latter that has made

more ground in picture quality and pricing in the past 12 months.



Pioneer's 109cm (43-inch) and 127cm sixth?generation plasmas have raised the bar

as far as the picture quality is concerned.



While the fifth-generation plasma is exceptional, Pioneer has managed to improve

on it even further and, the best part is, the price remains the same.



However, in the LCD arena there has been plenty of movement, especially in the

80cm?100cm bracket.



Plasma has established itself as the display of choice in sizes of 106cm and

above.



And until recently, an 94cm LCD TV was more expensive than a 106cm plasma.



But the price-per-square-inch for LCD has undergone marked improvement with many

94cm models coming in at the $3000 mark.



Two LCD TVs caught our eye this year.



The first is BenQ's 94cm DV3750, a high definition display which is bundled with

a HD set-top box to bring out the best possible picture.



The other is Sony's new 100cm Bravia.



The Bravia was released late in the year and, from what Digital Life has seen,

it really has taken LCD right up to the next level entirely.



On the speaker side we were also very impressed with LG's wireless home theatre

system, which allowed users to set up the rear speakers without having to snake

inconvenient speaker cable all the way to the back of the room.



Next year, keep an eye out for even better quality plasma and LCD screens, which

will be equal in size, price and quality.





Mobiles



This is one of the fastest-developing areas of technology, with literally

hundreds of handsets released this year.



Users are changing their phones more often and there is no shortage of choice to

suit a wide range of needs.



The networks have also improved, with all major operators now offering 3G

services such as music and video downloads, and video calling.



Music is a big factor in handset design this year with some interesting results.



At the same time, built-in cameras were also improving and it became the year

the handset became a credible camera and MP3 player.



Nokia's new N Series of handsets, or devices, as they are now labelled,

illustrate this point well (pictured above). The N90 has a two megapixel camera

which uses Carl Zeiss optics. And the soon-to-be-released N91 contains a 4GB

hardrive to let you store literally hundreds of songs, as you would on your

iPod.



Nokia also turned plenty of heads with its stylish 8800. This stainless steel

handset was elegantly designed and positioned as a product for the top end of

town.



Sony Ericsson made significant ground in 2005 with two handsets that drew a line

in the sand in terms of picture and sound quality.



The K750i handset (pictured left) features a two?megapixel camera which captures

quality shots to share via Bluetooth with other users, or to your computer or

printer.



On the music front, Sony Ericsson unleashed its Walkman brand on the W800i and

the result was a library full of songs in your pocket.



The distinctive orange handset also contained a two-megapixel camera as well, so

it really was a winner all round.



In 2006, get ready for more handsets to hit the three megapixel mark, and to

contain larger flash memory storage capacity allowing them to store more than

1000 songs with ease. 3G will also start to take off, with more of your music

content downloaded directly to your phone.



Digital imaging



There were almost as many new digital cameras released in 2005 as there were

sunrises.



The entry point has moved up from 3.2 megapixel resolution up to five megapixel

and beyond. And 2005 was year that high definition was put into the hands of the

consumer, with Sony's HC-1 camcorder.



This video camera can capture your memories so you can relive them in all their

glory on the growing number of HD-ready display devices consumers are snapping

up.



On the still camera side, Kodak steps up to the next level with its Easy Share

One camera. What sets this apart from the competition is its ability to connect

to a wireless network to share photos via email right out of the camera.



As far as photo printers go, HP's 3310 is particularly impressive, with an

ability to print out 15cmx10cm (6x4s) pictures in an amazing 14 seconds. The

3310 was also wi-fi capable and could receive photos and documents and print

them without cables.



In 2006, expect even greater resolution from the new models, as well as wider

adoption of wireless capabilities.





Digital music



One word can be used to describe the highlight of 2005: iPod.



Mobile handset manufacturers have tried to cut into the market but products

tagged as "iPod killers'' promptly crashed and burned.



They got lost in the twisting wake of Apple's ubiquitous digital music player,

which was offered in three new forms this year.



There was the iPod Shuffle (pictured top left), the incredibly small iPod Nano,

as well as the fifth-generation regular iPod.



This not only got thinner, but also gained the ability to play videos. The video

iPod has been the stand-out product and offers a bigger, sharper screen with a

cover in a choice of traditional white or the now popular black.



Our own iTunes online music store finally opened in October, allowing

Australia's iPod owners to legally download the latest tracks.





Computers and software



Laptops have become the computer of choice for more people, so there is no

shortage of new models. It's standing out in the crowd takes something special.



What did impress is Acer's Ferarri notebook computer with its distinct carbon

fibre design and unmistakable prancing stallion logo.



And Asus is a company which has come a long way in a short time in Australia.

Apart from being a powerful computer, the Asus A5 notebook is a mobile

entertainment system complete with digital TV tuner and an FM radio.



In the desktop area, Apple once again caught the eye with its G5 iMac (pictured

right). This latest version features a built-in iSight camera as well as Front

Row, an application which allows you to view digital content and control it all

from across the room with a tiny remote.







Gaming



It is not every day that a new gaming system is released, but this year the

PlayStation Portable finally hit the market in September.



What makes the PSP such a hot item is the fact that it can not only play great

games but also allow users to watch DVD quality movies, listen to music, view

photos and even get on the internet.
