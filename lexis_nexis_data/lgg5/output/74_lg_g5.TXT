BARCELONA // With the new G5, LG may well have come up with the defining

smartphone of this year's MWC. Not necessarily the best - the Samsung Galaxy S7

Edge is probably the lead contender right now - but the G5 is the boldest

flagship smartphone from a manufacturer in years.



Billed as the world's first modular smartphone (a few Kickstarter inventors

might be consulting lawyers), the G5 enables the user to remove the bottom of

the device via a surprisingly smooth mechanism, and fit in a number of

interchangeable modules, or "friends" as LG describes them. LG has already shown

us the LG Cam Plus, an enlarged camera grip with additional controls and more

battery power, as well as the LG Hi-Fi Plus, a high-resolution audio module

developed in conjunction with Bang & Olufsen.



And in an age of tweaks and upgrades, these "friends" have game-changing

potential.



It would be a mistake, however, to describe the G5 as just "the module phone".

The neat lines of the G4 and G3 have been transformed and replaced with a

beautifully crafted minimalist look with soft curved edges, putting the G5 in

the same league as the HTC M9 and the iPhone 6 in terms of design.



The G4's superb 16MP camera is once again present and has been joined on the

rear of the phone by a 135-degree wide-angle 8-megapixel camera.



The 5.3 inch display is a touch smaller than the G4's, but sports a higher pixel

density, with images and videos as pleasing as on their predecessor. And at long

last, a rear-mounted fingerprint reader is also thrown in.



The G5 is expected to hit the shelves from the beginning of April, with no word

on price so far. But however expensive it is, it will be near the top of our

wish lists in the next couple of months.
