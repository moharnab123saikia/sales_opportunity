With the launch of the LG G5 right around the corner, we are starting to see
more about the accessories for the LG G5. Aptly called the LG G5 Friends lineup,
this series of accessories also include various modular accessories.

This new video shows some of the LG 360 CAM's features and options. The video is
essentially a run throigh of the initial set up of the camera as well as using
it. It also looks at the LG G5 companion software, and the Friends Manager App,
which apart from managing the settings for various accessories, lets the user to
use the G5 as a viewfinder for the external camera.

LG is banking on accessories this year with the G5. Other accessories seen in
the G5 lineup include the he LG CAM Plus modular grip accessory, the B&O Hi-Fi
audio module, a Rolling Bot home security robot, and the LG 360 VR headset.
Other third party components may appear later on.

The LG 360 CAM is currently available to pre-order from B&H Photo for $199.
