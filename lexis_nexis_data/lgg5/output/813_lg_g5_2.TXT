A SPORTING SURPRISE

Two and a half years of work, of planning and training public officers and
volunteers, came down to two weeks of the SEA Games. I was overwhelmed by how
Singaporeans reacted to it. You wonder if people will turn up to watch the
Games. Even if they don't, will they generally be supportive of it? I didn't
expect the kind of reception we got from Singaporeans from all walks of life -
attending the Games, watching it on television and online. It was quite
heartening. What I found inspiring were people who took seven days of leave to
contribute to the Games- not just one or two, but about 100 people. I will also
never forget the Asean Para Games. It is a unique platform for people with
disabilities to pursue sports. What struck me was the power of the human spirit
I saw there: how they can strive to overcome disadvantages.

MR MUHAMMAD ROSTAM, 48, was in charge of planning manpower roles for the SEA
Games, which involved some 17,000 volunteers, and for the Asean Para Games last
year.

IMPARTING CRUCIAL INFORMATION

A witty and humorous persona is a wonderful way to draw in and impact the
netizens, while imparting important public education and fire advisory messages.
Somehow, people remember you more from your creative posts as opposed to
straight forward narratives. However, we should be mindful that humour is
subjective and we should consider all angles, perspectives and possible nuances
before deciding to publish a post. Our lean social media team comprises only six
officers. Our decision on the best approach to achieve our online objectives is
always achieved through our informal and swift deliberation via our WhatsApp
chat group.

LT-COL LESLIE WILLIAMS, 50, spearheads the SCDF's social media team, which has
built up a reputation for being witty and accessible, while disseminating
serious information to the public.

SEE THE PERSON BEHIND THE ILLNESS

Individuals with mental health issues are stereotyped and commonly referred to
as 'mad people' or 'xiao lang' (in Hokkien). They are judged, cast aside and
undermined. They are more than their mental illness.What has saddened me the
most from my experiences is how often we forget to see the person behind the
mental health condition and, thus, fail to truly care for and understand our
fellow human being. I've even come across cases in
 which community health workers themselves propose permanent
institutionalisation for patients who are still capable of living as 'normally'
as possible with some support. We are so ready to turn to the easier option of
'hiding' and casting them aside when we could do more to support and accept them
into the community.
