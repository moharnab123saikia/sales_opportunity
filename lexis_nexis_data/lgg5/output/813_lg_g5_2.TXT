A SPORTING SURPRISE



Two and a half years of work, of planning and training public officers and

volunteers, came down to two weeks of the SEA Games. I was overwhelmed by how

Singaporeans reacted to it. You wonder if people will turn up to watch the

Games. Even if they don't, will they generally be supportive of it? I didn't

expect the kind of reception we got from Singaporeans from all walks of life -

attending the Games, watching it on television and online. It was quite

heartening. What I found inspiring were people who took seven days of leave to

contribute to the Games- not just one or two, but about 100 people. I will also

never forget the Asean Para Games. It is a unique platform for people with

disabilities to pursue sports. What struck me was the power of the human spirit

I saw there: how they can strive to overcome disadvantages.



MR MUHAMMAD ROSTAM, 48, was in charge of planning manpower roles for the SEA

Games, which involved some 17,000 volunteers, and for the Asean Para Games last

year.

IMPARTING CRUCIAL INFORMATION



A witty and humorous persona is a wonderful way to draw in and impact the

netizens, while imparting important public education and fire advisory messages.

Somehow, people remember you more from your creative posts as opposed to

straight forward narratives. However, we should be mindful that humour is

subjective and we should consider all angles, perspectives and possible nuances

before deciding to publish a post. Our lean social media team comprises only six

officers. Our decision on the best approach to achieve our online objectives is

always achieved through our informal and swift deliberation via our WhatsApp

chat group.



LT-COL LESLIE WILLIAMS, 50, spearheads the SCDF's social media team, which has

built up a reputation for being witty and accessible, while disseminating

serious information to the public.

SEE THE PERSON BEHIND THE ILLNESS



Individuals with mental health issues are stereotyped and commonly referred to

as 'mad people' or 'xiao lang' (in Hokkien). They are judged, cast aside and

undermined. They are more than their mental illness.What has saddened me the

most from my experiences is how often we forget to see the person behind the

mental health condition and, thus, fail to truly care for and understand our

fellow human being. I've even come across cases in

 which community health workers themselves propose permanent

institutionalisation for patients who are still capable of living as 'normally'

as possible with some support. We are so ready to turn to the easier option of

'hiding' and casting them aside when we could do more to support and accept them

into the community.
