NEW DELHI: Samsung has launched its Galaxy Note 7 phablet with a bunch of new

security features including the iris scanner. The phablet packs high-end

specifications and is also optimised to work with the next-gen Gear VR headset,

which also launched alongside the Note 7. Samsung calls its new phablet to be

the 'world's most intelligent smartphone'. Although the company has not yet

mentioned the India price of the Galaxy Note 7, the device would definitely be

competing with the flagship devices in the market. To see where the Galaxy Note

7 stands against other high-end handsets in the market, here is a comparison of
