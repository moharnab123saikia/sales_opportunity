 ZTE Senior Director of Mobile Devices Waiman Lam said in an interview at the

Mobile World Congress that the company is cautiously targeting growth of around

60 million units, which would mark a 7 percent rise in unit sales from 2015.

 The higher end of its target range, 70 million units, would represent around 20

percent growth over 2015.

 ZTE unveiled two new models in its high-volume, value-priced line and unveiled

a new sports marketing partnership with Spanish football club Seville, taking a

page from a strategy that has turned ZTE into the 4th largest U.S. smartphone

vendor.

 The Blade V7 Lite offers a 5-inch screen that can be operated with one hand and

a fingerprint scanner for users to sign on to the phone. It will initially be

sold in Russia and in coming months in markets including Mexico, Spain, Germany

and Thailand.

 A slightly larger Blade V7 sports a 5.2-inch screen in a metallic case for

single-hand use and both front and rear 13-megapixel cameras. Instead of

fingerprint security, it offers ZTE's retinal eye-scan feature and goes on sale

in summer.
