NEW DELHI: Google is working on a new operating system, codenamed 'Fuchsia'. The

OS was found as a part of a developer code on GitHub and Google's own code

repository website. The OS is said to be focussed on IoT (Internet of Things)

and does not run on Linux unlike Android and Chrome OS.First spotted by Android

Police, the OS is based on Magenta, which is a "medium-sized microkernel" that

itself is based on a project called as LittleKernel. The platform is said to be

designed for embedded systems for instance a PC that doesn't use the regular OS,

GPS devices or car dashboards.On further finding, the GitHub website titled

"Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System)" adds that the Google Fuchsia

OS is for "modern phones and modern personal computers" that are based on "fast

processors" and use "trivial amounts of RAM."As per multiple reports, the Google

Fuchsia OS might become the ultimate OS as it may unify Chrome OS, Android and

the IoT platform, Brillo.



This means it would take just one OS to run from desktops to smartphones,

tablets, and everything else.The Fuchsia OS's kernel includes OS features like

user modes and a capability-based security model. Although Google is yet to give

details on the project and on which device will we see it first, a Google

engineer named Travis Geiselbrecht has said it would arrive on Raspberry Pi 3

soon, reports Y Combinator news website.Talking about OSes, Google has started

rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat previews to Sony Xperia X Performance and LG G5

smartphones.
