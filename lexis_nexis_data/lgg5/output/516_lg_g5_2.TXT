The high street staple that keeps on rolling

River Island started life as Lewis, opened by Bernard Lewis in Hackney, London,
in 1948. The store transmogrified into Chelsea Girl in the Sixties and was
joined, in the early Eighties, by Concept Man. In 1988 the company was rebranded
as River Island. To mark the 20th anniversary of YMC, River Island is bringing
15 of the British label's archive pieces back to life including this pocket
T-shirt, £25 (left), rib collar shirt, £45 (far left and above left) and, above
right, shoulder bag, £50 (www.riverisland.com).

Pitch perfect

As the Euros reach the knockout stage, lifestyle store Yoox has invited
designers from around the world to interpret their team for a capsule
collection, #Yooxsoccercouture. Paul Smith turns out for England, with a design
that nods to the uniting aspects of sport. The sweater is £112, and the T-shirt
is £64 (www.yoox.com).

MARIO'S WORLD

Rome-based eyewear brand LGR has teamed up with photographer Mario Testino for a
limited-edition sunglasses collection. Featuring lenses that selectively filter
colour as well as UV rays, the sunglasses are handmade in Italy and cost £290,
with 25 per cent of proceeds donated to Testino's non-profit centre for Peruvian
culture, MATE (www.lgrworld.com).

5 reasons why we love...

LG G5 H850 Titan

1. Its newly developed popout feature gives pictures taken by the standard and
wide-angle lens a frame effect so every snap is Instagram worthy.

2. It boasts a slick 5.3in screen with rich colours.

3. It's ultra-thin and weighs only 159g.

4. The home screen is always "on" so you'll always know the time and date.

streaming is always possible (£499, www.lg.com/uk; £32 per month on a Red 1GB
