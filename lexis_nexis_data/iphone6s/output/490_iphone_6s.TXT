In a first, Apple has decided to offer discount on its latest iPhones in less

than a month of its launch, with the Cupertino-based company initiating a

buyback offer on iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, giving consumers discount of up to '.

34,000 to boost sales.



This is also the first instance when Apple and its distributors are going to buy

back old models under the scheme to ensure that all transactions are genuine and

reduce the burden of the retailer who can push sales further, three senior trade

partners of Apple in India said.



The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were launched last month in India at ' '92,000 de .

62,000-.pending on memory and



model, but sales were down 15-20% over last year as iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which

hit the market last year, were . 8,500-9,000.cheaper by ' Ingram Micro, one of

Apple's four iPhone distributors, has just rolled out the buyback scheme in a

handful of Apple stores and multi-brand cellphone retail



chains in South India, which will be subsequently tak



en national.The other three distributors will also follow suit since the US



low suit since the US company wants to achieve its target of trebling sales

during the October-December quarter compared with the same period last year.



"This is the first time a company and its distributors are closely monitoring

buyback



at the retail end to track sales, showing how desperate Apple is to increase

sales in India since it did not expect such a weak launch for the new iPhones,"

a senior executive with one of the leading trade partners said."Earlier

companies offering buyback used to give indirect subsidy to retailers to com

pensate and it was



the retailer's headache to sell the old phone, but this time



the entire process is driven by Apple," he said.



The buyback price of



. 34,000 on the new iPhones is ' against iPhone 6. The company has informed

trade that it will also buy back select highend handsets of rival Samsung. Apple

has also created a separate website for retailers



have to upload details of old handsets against which the new models will be

bought.



The buyback offer comes at a time when the latest iPhones are getting sold at

711% discount since last week in ecommerce marketplaces such as Flipkart,

Snapdeal and Amazon.



Snapdeal's vice-president (category management) Rahul Taneja said various

promotional offers have led to great traction for the new iPhones. "We are

getting orders for iPhone 6s not only from metros, but also from Tier-II

cities," he said. .



Last month, during an analyst conference call, the Apple management had

acknowledged that the higher pricing of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in India and some

other markets due to foreign exchange fluctuations has had an impact on their

sales.
