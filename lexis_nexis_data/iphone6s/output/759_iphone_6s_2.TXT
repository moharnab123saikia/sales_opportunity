has appeared on Chinese social media website Weibo.



The alleged leak confirms 'iPhone SE' as the name of the upcoming Apple

smartphone and a version with 16GB onboard storage. The leaked image also shows

According to earlier reports, iPhone 4SE's rear camera will support 4K videos

and is tipped to sport 8MP camera setup (similar to iPhone 6's).



The company's iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S plus models, launched last year, also

offer support for 4K videos. The small-screen iPhone is said to be powered by

the current flagship's A9 chipset. It will also support features like Apple Pay

and Live Photos but not 3D Touch, which will remain exclusive to iPhone 6S and

6S Plus for now.



iPhone 4SE is speculated to come in silver, space grey, gold and rose gold

colour options.
