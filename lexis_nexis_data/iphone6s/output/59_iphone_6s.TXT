There's just 10 more sleeps until the latest iPhone is released in Ireland.



Apple's latest offerings - the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus - are due to hit

Irish shores on October 9, but they're going to set you back a bit.



The iPhone 6S starts at (EURO)759 for the 16GB model, while the 64GB one will

set you back (EURO)869 and the 128GB model will cost (EURO)979.



Meanwhile the iPhone 6S Plus will cost (EURO)869, (EURO)979 and (EURO)1,089 for

the three different sizes.



While the handsets might look similar, the 6S Plus features a number of

improvements - including Apple's faster A9 processor, a 12 megapixel camera, and

a Force Touch display.



The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus went on sale in selected countries on September

25 - setting a new first-weekend sales record with 13 million units sold.



Irish customers will be able to get their hands on the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S

Plus beginning October 9.



Vodafone confirmed that customers will be able to pre-order their handsets from

October 2.
