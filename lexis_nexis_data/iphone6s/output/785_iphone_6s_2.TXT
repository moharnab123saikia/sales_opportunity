 Kansas: Sprint Corporation has issued the following Press release:




 At $60/month, Sprint offers the lowest rate among national carriers for an
unlimited high-speed data, talk and text plan. T-Mobile&rsquo;s Simple Choice
unlimited talk, text and high-speed data plan is $80/month. AT&T and Verizon no
longer offer unlimited data plans. Simple, easy, affordable &ndash; the Sprint
$60 Unlimited Plan is available to new and existing Sprint customers through
Oct. 15, 2015. Beginning Oct. 16, the $60 Unlimited Plan will increase to
$70/month.
 &ldquo;At Sprint, we give customers what they want &ndash; and they want the
option of unlimited data,&rdquo; Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said. &rdquo;At $70 a
month, Sprint still beats the competition. Rather than increase the price
without warning, we want to give customers one last chance to take advantage of
the $60 rate.&rdquo;
 For customers who are tired of worrying about monthly data overage charges and
who want an unlimited plan for the best value, this is a great time to make the
switch to Sprint. To qualify for the plan, customers must purchase their device
through iPhone Forever, Sprint Lease, Sprint Easy Pay, pay full retail price or
bring their own compatible device. And for customers who are stuck with another
carrier, Sprint will pay off their current contract or phone balance to cover
costs to switch &ndash; after online registration via American Express Reward
Card1.
 Mobile data usage is skyrocketing. Between 2010 and 2014, mobile data traffic
in the United States increased 947 percent2. Sprint wants to keep offering
unlimited data at a great value, allowing customers the ability to use their
phone in all the ways they want. Sprint&rsquo;s Unlimited Plan ensures customers
are getting the best data experience, whether they are checking emails, watching
videos, sending pictures, or managing their business and personal lives. All
while on the Sprint network.3

 Get the iPhone 6s 16GB and Unlimited Data for $61/month
 For a limited time, you can combine the best unlimited plan with the
world&rsquo;s best offer for iPhone 6s&hellip;$61/month for iPhone 6s 16GB and
unlimited talk, text and data. Through iPhone Forever, Sprint is offering the
iPhone 6s 16GB for $1/month and the iPhone 6s Plus for $5/month with the
trade-in of an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus that the customer owns in full.
Included in the price, Sprint customers can always upgrade to the latest iPhone.

 Qualified Sprint customers can also get iPhone 6s 16GB for $15/month and iPhone
6s Plus 16GB for $19/month when they turn in a working smartphone, making it the
most affordable way to get the new iPhones on Sprint.
 Through Dec. 31, 2015, customers who switch to Sprint or existing Sprint
customers who are upgrade-eligible and turn in any other smartphone will get a
promotional rate of $15/month on iPhone 6s 16GB, regularly $22/month without a
trade-in, or $19/ month on the iPhone 6s Plus 16GB, regularly $26/month without
a trade-in4.
 Current Sprint customers on the Sprint $60 Unlimited Plan will not be impacted
by the change
 Current Sprint customers already on the Sprint $60 Unlimited Plan will be able
to remain on the plan at the $60/month rate when the new price comes into effect
Oct. 16. Those customers also may activate a new phone and remain on the $60
Unlimited Plan as long as they still meet the plan requirements and are
purchasing a phone option and financing option that is compatible with the plan.
