DATELINE: Lahore







 Kansas: Sprint Corporation has issued the following Press release:









 At $60/month, Sprint offers the lowest rate among national carriers for an

unlimited high-speed data, talk and text plan. T-Mobile&rsquo;s Simple Choice

unlimited talk, text and high-speed data plan is $80/month. AT&T and Verizon no

longer offer unlimited data plans. Simple, easy, affordable &ndash; the Sprint

$60 Unlimited Plan is available to new and existing Sprint customers through

Oct. 15, 2015. Beginning Oct. 16, the $60 Unlimited Plan will increase to

$70/month.

 &ldquo;At Sprint, we give customers what they want &ndash; and they want the

option of unlimited data,&rdquo; Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said. &rdquo;At $70 a

month, Sprint still beats the competition. Rather than increase the price

without warning, we want to give customers one last chance to take advantage of

the $60 rate.&rdquo;

 For customers who are tired of worrying about monthly data overage charges and

who want an unlimited plan for the best value, this is a great time to make the

switch to Sprint. To qualify for the plan, customers must purchase their device

through iPhone Forever, Sprint Lease, Sprint Easy Pay, pay full retail price or

bring their own compatible device. And for customers who are stuck with another

carrier, Sprint will pay off their current contract or phone balance to cover

costs to switch &ndash; after online registration via American Express Reward

Card1.

 Mobile data usage is skyrocketing. Between 2010 and 2014, mobile data traffic

in the United States increased 947 percent2. Sprint wants to keep offering

unlimited data at a great value, allowing customers the ability to use their

phone in all the ways they want. Sprint&rsquo;s Unlimited Plan ensures customers

are getting the best data experience, whether they are checking emails, watching

videos, sending pictures, or managing their business and personal lives. All

while on the Sprint network.3

 Get the iPhone 6s 16GB and Unlimited Data for $61/month

 For a limited time, you can combine the best unlimited plan with the

world&rsquo;s best offer for iPhone 6s&hellip;$61/month for iPhone 6s 16GB and

unlimited talk, text and data. Through iPhone Forever, Sprint is offering the

iPhone 6s 16GB for $1/month and the iPhone 6s Plus for $5/month with the

trade-in of an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus that the customer owns in full.

Included in the price, Sprint customers can always upgrade to the latest iPhone.



 Qualified Sprint customers can also get iPhone 6s 16GB for $15/month and iPhone

6s Plus 16GB for $19/month when they turn in a working smartphone, making it the

most affordable way to get the new iPhones on Sprint.

 Through Dec. 31, 2015, customers who switch to Sprint or existing Sprint

customers who are upgrade-eligible and turn in any other smartphone will get a

promotional rate of $15/month on iPhone 6s 16GB, regularly $22/month without a

trade-in, or $19/ month on the iPhone 6s Plus 16GB, regularly $26/month without

a trade-in4.

 Current Sprint customers on the Sprint $60 Unlimited Plan will not be impacted

by the change

 Current Sprint customers already on the Sprint $60 Unlimited Plan will be able

to remain on the plan at the $60/month rate when the new price comes into effect

Oct. 16. Those customers also may activate a new phone and remain on the $60

Unlimited Plan as long as they still meet the plan requirements and are

purchasing a phone option and financing option that is compatible with the plan.
