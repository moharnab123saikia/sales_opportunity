On Sunday, tech giant Apple released three new star-studded commercials -- two

short ads; and one proper minute-long commercial -- for its iPhone 6S handset.



The two new iPhone 6S ads released by Apple feature Jamie Foxx showing off the

company's Siri virtual personal assistant; while the one-minute commercial

features a brief sequence starring Golden State Warriors cager Steph Curry, the

2015 NBA MVP and two-time NBA All-Star.



Both Foxx and Curry feature in the new iPhone 6S commercial in cameo parts.



In one of the two new short ads for iPhone 6S, Foxx can be seen in interaction

with the Apple Siri virtual personal assistant with the help of the new 'Hey

Siri' feature. The new feature underscores an always-on hands-free technology

which has been made possible by the M9 motion coprocessor in iPhone 6S handset.



The other short ad featuring Foxx demonstrates Siri's capability to process

conversational interactions, which have now been augmented by Apple through the

'Hey Siri' hands-free technology.



A one-minute, narrated commercial for iPhone 6S basically highlights the iSight

and FaceTime HD cameras of the handset. The ad essentially marks Apple's return

to the "only thing that's changed is everything" theme of iPhone 6S, drawing

attention to some of the handset's upgraded specifications like 4K video

recording, and high-definition slo-mo, among others.
