New Delhi, Sept. 30 -- Zee Media Bureau
 All the ardent Apple fans who can't wait for the official launch of iPhone 6S
and iPhone 6S Plus on October 16, there is a piece of news which might interest
you.


 The customs officials at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport have
seized over 180 iPhones, all to be sold in the grey market, according to news
reports.
 Smuggled iPhone 6S handsets are already on sale at Gaffar Market in Karol Bagh
(New Delhi), the largest grey market for phones in north India and are available
at a price of over Rs 1 lakh.
 The over-the-roof price for the new iPhones comes from the demand of hardcore
iPhone fans, who are willing to spend a fortune just to get the handset before
it is officially released in the market.
 The iPhones go on sale in India on October 16 and while there is no official
word on pricing, many websites that offer to ship the devices after buying them
in other countries are showing a starting price of over Rs 60,000 for the base
variant.
