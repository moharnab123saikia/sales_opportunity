Apple iPhone 6S, 6S Plus in India: 10 things to know

LENGTH: 660 words





Apple's latest smartphones -- iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus -- are finally here!

Launched in India within a month of their global rollout for the first time, the

new iPhones look pretty similar to last year's models, but sport for a lot of

new features, like 3D Touch and better camera



But these are not the only new thing to look forward to. Here are 10 things you

need to know about Apple's new iPhone 6S:



3D Touch



Most smartphone users are accustomed to 'multi-touch' -- the ability for phones

to recognize touches from multiple fingers, enabling such capabilities as

pinching to zoom. With the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, Apple brings in 3D Touch.



Pressing down hard on the new iPhones will launch additional capabilities. For

example, you can get quick access to tasks such as taking a selfie or getting

directions home. From a message, 3D Touch will give you a preview of a web link

without launching the browser. Similarly, press for a few seconds on a document

icon, and a preview pops out. Press on an address in an email, and a map opens

up. On some video apps, the pressure determines how quickly you forward or

rewind.



12MP rear camera



After being stuck with an 8MP camera sensor since iPhone 4S, the iPhone range

has finally received a substantial megapixel upgrade. iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S

Plus sport a 12MP rear camera, with 50% more focus pixels to ensure faster

autofocus.



Apple says that the new iPhones' camera will deliver more detailed photos than

ever before. It can also capture panorama shots in 63MP resolution and capture

videos in 4K (movie hall quality) resolution.



5MP selfie camera



The selfie camera has also got an upgrade this year, jumping from 1.2MP in

iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to 5MP in iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.



Though it is not backed by a front-facing LED flash, Apple has used a technology

called Retina Flash to deliver brighter selfies. This feature increases the

brightness of the screen by three times, which Apple claims is comparable to

that of its rear dual-LED flash.



The front camera also gets an upgrade. It'll be 5MP FaceTime HD camera that uses

the phone's Retina display for a flash for "detailed selfies." Apple claims that

the new capabilities will now let the display light up 3-times brighter for a

flash that's comparable to that of the TrueTone flash on the back.



Live Photos



Apple has also debuted a feature called Live Photos in the camera app, which

will capture a 1.5-second video before and after you click the shutter in order

to create animated GIFs. Facebook has already added support for Live Photos,

while others may follow suit soon.



A new colour



The new iPhone 6S Plus will also come in a rose gold colour, as well as the

standard silver, gold and space gray hues.



More durable body



Though the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus look the same as their respective predecessors,

they are made of stronger material. Apple has used aircraft-grade 7000 aluminium

alloy, which is less dense and lighter than standard metals used in smartphones,

but is up to 60% stronger.



Apple has also said that the glass used in the touchscreen this time is stronger

than ever before.



Faster processor



The new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus pack the new 64-bit A9 chip with integrated M9

motion coprocessor under the hood, which processes apps 70% faster and graphics

90% faster according to Apple.



Faster fingerprint sensor



Apple says that the TouchID fingerprint sensor used in iPhone 6S and 6S Plus is

twice as fast as the one used in previous iPhones and iPads.



Improved 4G and Wi-Fi performance



Apple has upgraded the wireless chips in iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus too, which

can download/upload data twice as fast compared to last year's models.



The two iPhones now support up to 23 4G LTE bands.



Price



Apple has priced the 16, 64 and 128GB variants of iPhone 6S at Rs 62,000, Rs

72,000 and Rs 82,000, respectively.



Likewise, the 16, 64 and 128GB versions of iPhone 6S Plus cost Rs 72,000, Rs

82,000 and Rs 92,000, respectively.
