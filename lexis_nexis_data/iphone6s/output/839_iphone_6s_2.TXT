Apple has bucked the bigger-is-better phone trend and released a revamped

version of its 4in iPhone 5S, the new iPhone SE.



It will be the smallest smartphone in Apple's current lineup and the first

smartphone to be released with a screen smaller than 4.7in since the iPhone 6

was released in September 2014.



Greg Joswiak, VP of product marketing for Apple said: "Some people simply love

smaller phones. And the 4in phone is often their first iPhone. Some people asked

and pleaded with us. So we're calling it, the iPhone SE. Our most powerful "



The iPhone SE - possibly harking back in name to the Macintosh SE computer,

which was released in 1987 - has a similar form-factor to 2013's iPhone 5S. It

has a metal body, 4in screen, Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a flush camera

lens, unlike Apple's most recent iPhones. The phone will be available in black,

white, gold and rose gold.



The outside of the device resembles an iPhone 5S but the inside will be similar

to the iPhone 6S, using Apple's A9 processor, an NFC chip with support for Apple

Pay and a better 12-megapixel camera, in line with Apple's 2015 iPhones.



The iPhone SE has double the processing power and four times the graphics

performance of the iPhone 5S, as well as longer battery life.



Apple hopes that the smaller smartphone will convince those still using an

iPhone 5, 5S or 5C that do not want a larger phone of the size of the 4.7in

iPhone 6S or 5.5in 6S Plus to upgrade. Cook estimates that 60% of those using

Apple's smaller iPhones have not yet upgraded to an iPhone 6 or newer, meaning

there is a large potential market waiting to be tapped.



Larger smartphone screens have proved popular and have allowed manufacturers to

add more features supported by larger batteries, Apple's iPhone with its 4.7in

screen is remained one of the smallest.



As a smaller, premium smartphone the new iPhone SE has little in the way of

competition. Only Sony produces a widely available flagship smartphone with a

smaller screen with the 4.6in Xperia Z5 Compact. Other smaller phones made by

Motorola, HTC and Samsung are cut-down, cheaper versions with poorer components

that target a more budget-conscious section of the market.



Whether there is still demand for a smaller premium-priced smartphone remains to

be seen. The downward pressure on price has meant decent smartphones now cost as

little as £130 with features similar to top-end models costing four times their

price.



For Apple, the iPhone SE represents a way to target a more cost-sensitive market

without stooping to budget levels. In the past the company has used older models

of the iPhone, maintaining the 2012 iPhone 4S for sale until the release of the

iPhone 6 in 2014, and previous models before that. But selling older smartphones

concurrently with new models has added to the company's burden to maintain

smartphone updates for longer, which it typically does for at least three years

after release.



The iPhone SE, with internals similar to an iPhone 6S at a lower price, is

easier to cater for with software updates because it reduces the number of

hardware variants Apple has to support.



The iPhone SE will be released on 31 March with pre-orders starting 24 March

costing from $399 in the US, or £359 in the UK, for 16GB of storage, $499 in the

US, or £439 in the UK, with 64GB of storage in the US.
