Should you fork over $650 or more to upgrade to the new iPhone?



It's a question many folks are asking  after Apple gave a sneak peek of new

editions at a media event here. The improved specs for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus

editions are overwhelming: better battery performance, a more powerful chip,

water-resistant body, more storage and a camera that has geeks like me drooling.



But if you've got an iPhone 6 or 6S, do you really need any of that?



Re-selling your old phone, trading it in, getting a new contract or paying full

price for the device is costly and an ordeal for many.



Buy the new one or stick with an old iPhone?



If you have the iPhone 5S or earlier, it's a no brainer. You want to have the

latest technology, not a phone from 2013.



If you've got a more recent model, such as the iPhone 6 or 6S, and are happy

with it, then by all means hold onto it. The phone still works, you've got an

always-on connection to the Internet, and the 6 and 6S runs the latest apps,

just like the 7.



And for that matter, the entry level model, the SE, which sells for $399, gives

you all the cool stuff you'll find on the iPhone 6S and 6 Plus but at a lower

price and a smaller 4-inch screen.



Two of the coolest new features being touted in the ads for the iPhone 7 are

software enhancements, and they'll work on older phones as well, as part of the

iOS 10 mobile operating system upgrade.



Siri, the personal digital assistant, will now work with many of your favorite

apps, including LinkedIn, Uber and Square Cash. iMessages also gets a new,

visual coat of paint. Your texts will have bigger fonts, and you'll have access

to funny stickers and new tools like being able to draw pictures directly onto

texts.



More storage is a big deal



For many of you, the biggest upgrade of all is the extra storage on the new

phones. Many people who get a 16 GB entry-level phone download some apps, take

some photos and videos, and within weeks, they're already out of room.



The new editions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and the previous models, the 6S and

6S Plus, all start at 32 GB, which is twice the storage, and welcome.



There is no way to upgrade your memory without buying a new phone since Apple

doesn't offer expandable storage, like many rivals do.



So if you're out of room, have a cracked screen and your phone is sluggish, I'd

certainly recommend getting the latest and greatest with the iPhone 7.



No headphone jack



This could be a deal-breaker for many of you. The new edition iPhones ditched

the long-standing headphone jack in order to make room and extend the battery

life. Headphones now get connected via the Lightning charging port, or you can

use wireless Bluetooth headphones. (To make it less painful, Apple is loading an

adapter to connect older traditional headphones to the Lightning port.)



Many online have expressed outrage at having to buy new headphones for the new

iPhone and have raised concerns -- how to charge the phone and listen to music

at the same time?



Belkin International to the rescue. The accessories manufacturer announced last

week a new device to do both: charge while listening to music, with the $39.99

Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar, which will be available Oct. 10.



Bottom line



The specs pretty much say it. The iPhone 7 is a slightly lighter phone, with

longer battery life, water resistance, better storage and improved camera.



But if your phone is fine and you're happy with it, by all means, save the money

and stick with what you've got.
