[#x130]STANBUL (C[#x130]HAN)- The iphone 6s will be on sale in Turkey on Oct.

23, a week later than the previously announced date, reportedly due to a bomb

attack in Ankara on Oct. 10 that killed 97 people.





Apple had previously said the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus would be available in

Turkey, India and Malaysia on Oct. 16. However, the release date has now been

changed to Oct. 23, according to the Apple Turkey website.

The postponement was due to the twin bomb attack in Ankara, a report on

appletoolbox.com website said on Wednesday, citing an emailed statement from an

Apple Turkey representative.

The representative was quoted by the website as saying, "We have decided to

postpone iPhone 6s sales due to the tragic attacks last weekend."

A twin bomb attack which had hit the Turkish capital Ankara on Oct. 10 killed 97

and injured more than 500 people. A three day mourning period was declared by

Turkish authorities after the attack, which is the deadliest in Turkey's

history.

Apple's CEO tim cook had said, "Prayers, condolences, and hope for all those

affected by the bombings in Turkey," on his Twitter account after the attack.

The iPhone 6S is expected to cost 3099 TL ($1052) for 16GB in Turkey, according

to the appletoolbox.com. Turkey stands out as the most expensive country to buy

an iPhone, data compiled by the website shows.
