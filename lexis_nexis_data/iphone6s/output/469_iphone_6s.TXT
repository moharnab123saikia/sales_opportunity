Apple TV



Some developers are calling this a game-changer - quite literally, since Apple

is taking a clear run at the game console market with a device that delivers

television, movie and music entertainment but with the added bonus of putting

games on the big screen. This little set top box delivers the power of a game

console like the Xbox 360, but in a smaller package and at a lower price. With

Apple launching an app store for TV apps and encouraging developers to populate

it as they have for iPhones and iPads, expect to see fast-growing choice in

games and other apps for the new Apple TV. The new Apple TV adds Siri voice

control plus a remote control that doubles as a game controller. Siri will

search across multiple content apps to give you various options for viewing. No

word yet on Canadian pricing, but the Apple TV 32GB model will be $149 US, with

the 64GB at $199 US.



iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus



While the new iPhones have kept the same screen size as their predecessors, the

iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6S, they have a number of tweaks and improvements. The

iPhone 6S has the same 12-centimetre screen size as the iPhone 6 and the 6S Plus

at 14 cm is the same as the 6 Plus. However, while they have the same Retina HD

display with 1920 by 1080-pixels for the Plus models and 1334 by 750-pixels for

the 6 and S6, the newest phones have new 3D Touch technology. That's a

pressure-sensitive technology that lets you take a quick look at a photo or

other content with a light touch or a deeper dive with more pressure. Live

Photos on the camera adds sound and action to the photos by automatically

capturing time both at the beginning and end of your photo shot. The new iPhones

deliver 4K video, a first for an iPhone, with a five-megapixel HD camera and a

new screen flash for selfies.



The rear-facing camera is 12 megapixels, up from 8MP on the 6 and 6 Plus.

Pre-orders start Saturday with the new phones due out Sept. 25. The new iPhones

will be available in gold, silver, space grey and a new colour, rose gold.

Pricing for the unlocked phones, which start with a 16GB model, with no contract

is as follows: iPhone 6S (unlocked, no contract) starting at $899 for 16GB,

$1,029 for 64GB and $1,159 for 128GB, and iPhone 6S Plus starting at $1,029 for

16GB, $1,159 for 32GB and $1,289 for 64GB.



iPad Pro



This isn't just another iPad upgrade - it's part of Apple's attempt to push into

the business market with a device that can deliver power and features better

than many notebook computers, but with a form factor that allows for true tablet

use. The iPad Pro has an optional $99 US Apple Pencil, a new stylus that is

geared to artists, designers and anyone else who wants to use the surface of the

iPad for writing or drawing. Apple promises a precision and lag-free performance

unmatched by other styli. There's also the $169 US Smart Keyboard, a combination

cover and keyboard that protects the screen and props the iPad up on a

kickstand, a little like the keyboard covers for Microsoft's Surface line of

tabletnotebook hybrids. The screen resolution is 2732 by 2048 pixels, higher

than any other Apple iOS device to date. The iPad Pro is slim at 6.9 mm, and

lightweight at just over 700 grams. It delivers 1.8 times the processing power

of the iPad Air 2 and double the graphics performance. It has an eightmegapixel

iSight camera and 1080p video recording. A new smart connector carries power and

data and connects magnetically to the keyboard. Canadian pricing hasn't yet been

announced for the iPad Pro, which is due out in November, but it starts at $799

US for the 32GB Wi-Fi model. The 128GB Wi-Fiplus-cellular model is $1,079. It

will come in silver, gold or grey.



Hermes Apple Watch



If you really want to impress an Apple fan on your gift list this year, you can

drop $1,100 US on the newest Apple Watch offering - make that $1,250 if you'd

like the extra-long band that wraps twice around your wrist. Along with the

Hermes Watch, Apple showed demos of the new Watch operating system, OS2, which

is due out Sept. 16.



In demos, the Watch was used for everything from Facebook Messenger to medical

monitoring and along with the highend Hermes edition, there are a number of new

strap colour and fashion options.
