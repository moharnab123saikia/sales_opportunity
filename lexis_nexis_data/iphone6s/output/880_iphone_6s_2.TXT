Dual-cam iPhone 7 Plus is editor's choice;

It is September again - that time of the year when Apple releases new iPhones.

Trevor Tan tests the latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus to see if they are worth your

moolah.

DESIGN - SAME BUT DIFFERENT



Despite being a full upgrade from 6 to 7 without any "S" suffix, the iPhone 7

and 7 Plus look almost like the previous two generations of iPhones.



In fact, both iPhones share the same physical dimensions as their immediate "S"

predecessors. Thickness, length and width are the same, with the same display

size and pixel resolution. However, they are up to 5g lighter than their direct

predecessors.



But both new iPhones are rated at IP67, which means they are dust resistant and

water resistant (they can be immersed in depths of up to 1m for 30min).



You can practically wash the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus after the phones get dirty or

smudgy.



The big news is the phones' lack of a headphone jack. In its place is another

set of speakers (more on the iPhones' audio later).



If you choose one of the two new black models - black or jet black - you can

hardly see the antenna bands.



The other three colours - silver, gold and rose gold - have the familiar white

fronts, while the black models have both their front and back in black.



The back of the black and jet black versions are finished in matte black and

glossy black, respectively. Both finishes picked up a fair share of smudges, but

the jet black model is more susceptible to fingerprints and scratches.



I know I am definitely going for a black iPhone 7 Plus, but I am still undecided

on which one.

NEW HOME BUTTON



Another design change you cannot see but can feel is the new Home button. It is

no longer a physical button but a touch-capacitive button.



Using a new Taptic Engine, the Home button gives haptic feedback when you press

it.



You can customise the strength of the haptic feedback. I put it to the highest

strength.



It takes a little while to get used to it, as you need to press slighty harder

to unlock the phone rather than merely touching the previous Home button. Other

than that, it is still the same Home button you use for Touch ID, Apple Pay,

taking screenshots and Siri.



However, to reboot the iPhone now, you have to press the volume down button

(instead of the Home button) and On/Off button together.



CAMERA AND DUAL-CAMERA



The iPhone is the world's most popular camera, according to photo-sharing site

Flickr. And Apple has improved on the camera of the new iPhones.



Although it has the same 12 megapixels as its predecessors, the iPhone 7's rear

camera now comes with a larger f/1.8 aperture (up from f/2.2) that allows up to

50 per cent more light into the improved image sensor for more details.



Both new iPhones also feature a quad-tone flash, instead of the previous

dual-tone, for more natural skin tones.



Previously, only the iPhone 6s Plus' rear camera had an optical image stabiliser

(OIS). But now, both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus' rear cameras have OIS.



Present in the iPhone 7 Plus only is a dual-camera system, whereby one

12-megapixel camera uses a wide-angle 28mm focal length and the other

12-megapixel camera uses a telephoto 56mm focal length. This translates to a 2x

optical zoom, but the telephoto camera lacks OIS.



Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus deliver sharper images with greater details, even

in the darker image areas, than their predecessors.



Auto white balance is spot on, and the camera does not produce over-vivid and

too-contrasty photos.



Image quality is equally top-notch for the 2x zoom lens.



Selfie lovers will like that the front-facing camera has been upgraded to seven

megapixels from five megapixels previously, and images appear much sharper too.



Using the quad-tone flash under incandescent lighting, I found the skin tones in

the images to be more natural than those of the iPhone 6s Plus.



SPEED



The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are both armed with the new A10 Fusion chip that

features a four-core processor design. It consists of two high-performance cores

and two high-efficiency cores for up to 40 per cent faster performance than the

iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.



The iPhone 7 scored 3,364 (single-core) and 5,314 (multi-core) points in the

GeekBench 4 benchmark test, while the iPhone 7 Plus scored 3,322 (single-core)

and 5,315 (multi-core) points. This is an increase in performance ranging from

25 per cent to 49 per cent, compared to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus respectively.



Graphics-intensive games, such as Implosion and Infinity Blade 3, displayed

great texture and played smoothly without any lag. It will certainly be more

than enough for your Pokemon Go hunts.



In addition, the storage capacities of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have been doubled

from those of their predecessors. So, I can finally get a 256GB iPhone for my

growing photo collection, which is reaching breaking point.



AUDIO



Like the iPad Pro, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus deliver great stereo output from

their built-in stereo speakers. You can easily tell which end of the phone the

sound is emanating from, or when you switch the orientation of the iPhone.



But the headphone jack is gone. I rarely listen to music on my iPhone, as I have

an iPod touch for that purpose. So it is not much of a loss to me.



However, out of the box, you get Apple's EarPods with Lightning connector and a

Lightning-to-3.5mm headphone jack adapter. So, you can still use all of your old

headphones.



Listening to the EarPods with Lightning connector and the old EarPods using the

adapter on an iPhone 7 Plus, I found that the Lightning EarPods have slightly

sharper vocals and a tad more bass.



Unfortunately, the Lightning EarPods do not work with my iPhone 6s Plus and iPod

touch. So do not buy a set thinking you can use it with your current iOS

devices.



Plus, the new iPhones do not support wireless charging. I see that as an issue

with some users who want to charge and listen to music at the same time.



BATTERY LIFE



To stress-test the battery, I looped a 720p video at full brightness and full

volume, and with Wi-Fi on.The iPhone 7 lasted 7hr 40min, while the iPhone 7 Plus

lasted 8hr.



This means that both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus lasted 50min more than their

respective predecessors, which is no mean feat.



Under normal use, which includes regularly checking Facebook updates and

e-mails, both phones should easily last through a full working day - unless you

are playing Pokemon Go all the time.



Â·Verdict: The Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus might not have the bells and whistles or

spanking new design of their competitors, but they are still undoubtedly some of

the best smartphones on the market. Personally, the dual-camera of the iPhone 7

Plus is enough reason for me to upgrade my iPhone 6s Plus. Question is, black or

jet black'
