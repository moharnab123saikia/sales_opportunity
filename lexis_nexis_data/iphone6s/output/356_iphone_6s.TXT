Apple fans on the mainland are over the moon - they'll be able to get hold of

the long-awaited iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models within this year as the

mainland has been included in the first batch of countries and regions to sell

the US tech giant's new next-generation iPhones.



Demand hits fever pitch as the mainland prepares to join the first batch to

market tech giant's latest iPhones



Apple fans on the mainland are over the moon - they'll be able to get hold of

the long-awaited iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models within this year as the

mainland has been included in the first batch of countries and regions to sell

the US tech giant's new next-generation iPhones.



At its annual showcase of new products in San Francisco on Thursday, Apple

offered the two latest models in its iPhone series, both of which are of the

same size as that of the large-screen phones introduced last year.



While the flagship smartphone's external casing has not undergone any change,

internal updates include a new camera and a faster fingerprint reader and

accelerated A9 processor, coupled with the biggest new feature of Apple's "3-D

Touch" - a new way of manipulating the phone depending on how hard you press.



Speaking at the launch event, Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company's iPhone

sales on the Chinese mainland in the last quarter grew by 75 percent

year-over-year - more than double the growth rate in other markets.



With demand for the new iPhones reaching fever pitch on the mainland, Cook said

he expected this market to "represent an unprecedented opportunity" for Apple.



At Shenzhen's Huaqiangbei commercial district - one of the mainland's largest

smartphone gray markets - vendors are set for a sales boom with the launch of

the two latest iPhone models.



According to a vendor surnamed Lin at a Huaqiangbei shop, a 16 GB iPhone 6s

could fetch more than 9,000 yuan ($1,411.7), with prices of a rose gold iPhone

6s handset outstripping those of three other colors.



Another vendor told China Daily that 16 GB iPhones 6s of four different colors

are already going at a single gray-market price of 9,580 yuan - 4,000 yuan more

than the original price.



However, Lin said it's still difficult to estimate the market price for the new

iPhones at the moment due to the heavy fluctuation. It would also depend on

market reaction as was the case when the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models made

their debut last year.



In previous years, iPhones had gone on sale on the mainland much later than

other markets due to difficulties in reaching an agreement over the license

application with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.



The delay, combined with high demand, triggered speculation, with many vendors

attracted by the huge potential profits of reselling the phones smuggled in from

other markets, including Hong Kong.



This time around, however, demand may be short-lived and less than expected, as

the mainland and Hong Kong are both listed among the 12 first-wave countries and

regions for the sale of the latest flagship smartphones.



Preorders will be accepted from Saturday and sales will kick off on Sept 25.



The new iPhones would normally fetch high gray-market prices in Hong Kong before

their official release.



At Sin Tat Plaza in Mong Kok, dealers estimated that the first units of the rose

gold 16 GB iPhone 6s model could cost HK$5,000 or HK$6,000 more than its

original price of HK$5,588. Models of other colors could fetch HK$2,000 or

HK$3,000 more.



The mainland's three largest telecommunication companies rolled out their

preorder services on Thursday.



According to data from China Mobile's website, more than 140,000 mainland

customers had already placed orders for the new iPhones online as of Thursday

evening.
