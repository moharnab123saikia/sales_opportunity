Earlier this month, T-Mobile had announced that it would be offering a special

price of $20 per month for 18 months to its customers for 16 GB iPhone 6s under

the lower-priced Jump On Demand Offerings. But, the latest news from the Company

will shock you as it is now offering iPhone 6s and 6sPlus for just $5 per month

if a customer trades in a working and undamaged Apples iPhones.



Through the company's Jump On Demand program, T-Mobile customers are also

eligible to get larger capacity iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. According to the

new deal by the Company, they will offer 128GB iPhone 6s for $3 per month if the

customer trades in an of an Apple iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+,

Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge or a Galaxy Note 5 smartphone. The Company has also

set the rate of the same 128GB iPhone 6s for $8 per month in trade of an iPhone

5s or a Samsung Note 4 or Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone, which would be $13 per

month on trade of any other phone.



This seems great that the company has decided to pay up to $650 per line in

switching costs and early termination fees for new customers. John Legere,

president and CEO of T-Mobile, said that offering iPhones at just small price

per month is just their way to attract customers to join T-Mobile.



On September 9, Apple has launched its new iPhone 6s featuring 4.7-inch display

covered in a new strong cover glass and built on fastest third-generation 64-bit

A9 chip.
