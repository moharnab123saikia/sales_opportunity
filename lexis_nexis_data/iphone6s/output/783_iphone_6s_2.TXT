iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus devices.

A YouTube video uploaded by the user, videosdebarraquito, has revealed some
serious flaws in the latest iOS 9.3.1 version of Apple. The new bug in the OS
enables anyone to access information like photos and contacts on an iPhone 6s
and iPhone 6s Plus device via bypassing the touch ID and passcode security
mechanisms.

The video showcases as how one first needs to access Siri by pressing the home
button on the device and giving it the command to search any domain name of an
email service provider with @ as a prefix on Twitter.

Once the Siri flashes the list of Tweets after the command, one can long press
the email address on a tweet, till the time the pop up appears and then can
select the option of 'Add new contact' to gain access to photos and also to
contacts in the phone by clicking on 'Add to existing contacts.' The hack is
only possible in 6s and 6s Plus devices due to the presence of the 3D touch
option.

Users, however, can secure their devices from this hack via cutting off Siri's
access to photos in the phone from the Privacy option in the settings menu. The
option of disabling Siri altogether from the device is also on the table, before
Apple comes up with a remedy for this security loophole.
