Apple In Fresh Trouble With New iOS 9 Bug

The new flaw lets anyone access critical information like photos and contacts on

iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus devices.



A YouTube video uploaded by the user, videosdebarraquito, has revealed some

serious flaws in the latest iOS 9.3.1 version of Apple. The new bug in the OS

enables anyone to access information like photos and contacts on an iPhone 6s

and iPhone 6s Plus device via bypassing the touch ID and passcode security

mechanisms.



The video showcases as how one first needs to access Siri by pressing the home

button on the device and giving it the command to search any domain name of an

email service provider with @ as a prefix on Twitter.



Once the Siri flashes the list of Tweets after the command, one can long press

the email address on a tweet, till the time the pop up appears and then can

select the option of 'Add new contact' to gain access to photos and also to

contacts in the phone by clicking on 'Add to existing contacts.' The hack is

only possible in 6s and 6s Plus devices due to the presence of the 3D touch

option.



Users, however, can secure their devices from this hack via cutting off Siri's

access to photos in the phone from the Privacy option in the settings menu. The

option of disabling Siri altogether from the device is also on the table, before

Apple comes up with a remedy for this security loophole.
