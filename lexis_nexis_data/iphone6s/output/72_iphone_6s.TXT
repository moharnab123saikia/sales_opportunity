

Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the company's much-awaited new iPhones - iPhone 6S
and iPhone 6S Plus - at a major product launch event held at the Bill Graham
Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on September 9.

While introducing the new iPhones, Cook said that though the overall look of the
iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus handsets may look "familiar," Apple has "changed
everything" about the two new iPhone models.

Both the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus handsets are powered by a faster A9
processor, speedier fingerprint sensors, and notably improved cameras. The new
iPhones come with a 12-megapixel iSight back camera and a

5-megapixel front-facing camera.

Moreover, the new iPhones also boast a 3D touch screen which has the capability
to recognize new gestures such as pressing and holding, and vibrates to indicate
that it has been pressed. The new handsets will also come with a new 'Live
Photos' feature which allows users to combine photos and videos.

The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus handsets are both made from 7000 series
aluminum; and will be available in four color options --- silver, gold, space
gray, and rose gold. The cost of the iPhone 7S will begin at $650; whereas the
cost of the iPhone 6S Plus will start at $750.
