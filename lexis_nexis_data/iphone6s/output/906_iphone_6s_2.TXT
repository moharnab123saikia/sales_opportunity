Mumbai : Apple's annual event is going to a big bag of goodies for Apple lovers.

The tech giant is all set to make announcements of new launches like the iPhone

6s, 6s Plus, a set top box and a rumoured 13-inch iPad Pro. The new iOS 9 is

also expected to be unveiled today.



The launch of a new iPhone might come as a disappointment to those who have

recently bought iPhone 6. The new iPhone is expected to be launched at same

price tag of iPhone 6. On the specs front, it will feature ForceTouch display,

Apple Watch-like animated wallpapers, faster A9 processor and Qualcomm-built

cellular chips. The camera is said to be completely overhauled. iPhone 6s and 6s

Plus will boost a 12 mega-pixel rear camera and 5 mega-pixel front camera. The

camera will also support 4k recording. Rumours have also hinted at a possible

pink iPhone, apart from Apple's standard slate grey, silver and gold ones.
