A close up look at the 'best iPhones yet'

Being an iOS user for years, "the good" and "the bad" words swarmed into my head

after using and testing the latest iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus for two weeks.



Here are some hands-on insights I want to highlight and the video above will

tell you more about the two devices.

Starting with a simple "touch"



The multi-touch display iPod Touch unveiled by Apple Inc in 2007 triggered a new

trend of human-computer interaction and Chinese consumers really started to

chase trendy technologies since the launch of iPhone 4 in 2010.



This year, Apple has upgraded its next-generation fingerprint recognition

feature, the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, making it easier and faster to unlock

your phone.



Users have been impressed after experiencing the response speed for activating

the function as the single press home button on the new iPhone will

simultaneously light the display and unlock the phone.



Sometimes this high-speed response can even present a problem when you simply

want to check the time or a notification without unlocking the screen.

3D Touch, a new technology introduced by the Cupertino company, allows users to

execute different commands depending on how hard they press the display.



Unlike previous multi-touch technology, which allows users to pinch and zoom, 3D

Touch will let users do what Apple calls 'peek' and 'pop'. Peeking or pressing

lightly on the display means previewing a piece of content and when you "pop" --

press on the screen harder and longer -- this will expand the content, letting

you interact with it.



As Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, pointed out the new feature "cuts out a number of

navigational steps to get where you're going".



Unlike the launch of the first generation Touch ID sensor, Apple said 3D Touch

will support third-party apps from the start.



For example, WeChat and Sina Weibo, two originally Chinese social media

applications, are the early birds that are redesigned to access 3D Touch. Users

can create new chat or new posts when "peeking" the apps.



Some of Apple's original apps, including Photos, Clock, Notes, Maps, Mail and

Messages are also built in the same function while others, such as Health,

Videos, Watch and Stocks are not.



One of the my favorites is that when you activate the function on the "Photos"

app, there's a "One Year Ago" short-cut that will let you skip directly into the

photo collections that you've saved in your phone a year earlier.

According to figures revealed by Apple, the new display assembly weighs twice as

much as the display assembly used in last year's models due to the 3D Touch

technology. In the iPhone 6, the display assembly weighed 12 grams. In the

iPhone 6s, it weighs 29 grams, more than double last year's model.



By comparison with the previous "double click home button" method to active

iPhone's multitasking interface, the iOS 9, Apple's newly launched mobile

operating system brings a distinct change to the features.



Instead of an app icon carousel -- which later became app panes -- that scrolls

from right to left, iOS 9 employs a stacked card interface and switches the

initial scroll direction to jibe with the mechanics of 3D Touch.



To invoke 3D Touch multitasking, start an off-screen swipe from the left screen

edge and press firmly on the screen while performing the left-to-right swipe

action.



Due to the size of iPhone 6s Plus, some people suggest that it's better to use

your left hand rather than the right to active this action and after using the

feature many times, I agree.



Stand out from the crowd



By taking Beijing's subway, massive "phubbers" are seen staring at their

smartphones and given the round home button on the bottom, some are iPhone

users.



An old Internet meme joked that in 2012, after the newly-launched EarPods, a new

designed earphone for Apple devices, started to ship with iPhone 5, cases of

theft on the subway rapidly rose as thieves could easily tell who was carrying

the new phone.



This year, the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have similar designs to the

previous generation. So what will make people quickly realize you are holding a

brand new iPhone? Right, the rose gold finish.



By introducing the new color for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the company

seems have attracted most loyal Chinese customers, especially female users, with

the conspicuous but not dazzling rose gold appearance.



The new color was seen as a hot choice for most buyers who appeared in the Apple

Store in Beijing's Sanlitun Village during the pick-up day for online pre-order

customers on September 25.



Build for the selfie-addict and video shooting lover



Apple made some serious upgrades for the new iPhones' iSight camera. It has

traded in its 8-megapixel rear shooter for a 12-megapixel variant with 1.22µ

pixels, offering 50 percent more than before.



The camera features a five-element lens with f/2.2 aperture and a sapphire lens

cover.



For 4K video shooting, the larger Plus model features optical stabilization as

its predecessor did while the smaller 6S only leaves room for digital

stabilization.



Some people argue that Live Photos, the new feature that allows users to capture

an extra 1.5 seconds of footage at the beginning and the end of the photo to

enable mini animations, is little more than a gimmick as few people will hold

the camera up for a couple of seconds after taking pictures.



In practice, I believe the feature is not designed for all-round photo shooting

circumstances. It's better to shoot with Live Photos mode when moving objects

are the main part of your pictures, such as a lyrical selfie, running pets or

even family parties. Rather than filming a painting or building.



To share the Live Photos is another issue that needs to be considered,

especially to share with a friend using a non-Apple device.



You'd better find an available video to Graphics Interchange Format transferring

app to deal with the matter.



Unbearable weight?



The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus weigh 14 and 20 grams more than their predecessors,

respectively.



The switch to 7000 series alloy aluminum, the same material used to build the

Apple Watch, accounts for just 2 grams of the weight increase of the iPhone 6s

Plus, while the aluminum for the iPhone 6s actually weighs a gram less.



If you are a male user who only carries your smartphone in your pocket, it seems

the iPhone 6s Plus is a bit overweight, while if you are addicted to the 4K

video and longer battery life, the 6s Plus is a nice option.



But then, nothing is perfect.



Apple said the new iPhones would be available in more than 40 additional

countries from October 9, reaching more than 130 by years-end.



Apple relies heavily on sales of the iPhone, which generated nearly two-thirds

of its revenue in the latest quarter, and during the first weekend of

availability in 12 markets, Apple said it had sold more than 13 million iPhone

6s and 6s Pluses, setting a record for its marquee product.
