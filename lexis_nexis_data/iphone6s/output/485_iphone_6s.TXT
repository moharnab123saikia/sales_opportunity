APPLE has enjoyed "phenomenal" sales of the newlylaunched iPhone 6s and iPhone

6s Plus, according to chief executive Tim Cook, selling more than 13 million

units within three days of availability.



The sales figures surpass last year's 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sales

within the same three-day period.



Mr Cook said: "Customers' feedback is incredible and they are loving 3D Touch

and Live Photos, and we can't wait to bring iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to

customers in even more countries on October 9." For the first time, China was

among the first countries to carry the new iPhones from release.



Previously, customers in China had to wait several weeks or months before new

models were approved for sale.



China is estimated to have accounted for between 2 and 2.5 million unit sales,

meaning non-China sales rose by between 5pc and 10pc, according to analysts FBR

& Co.



The new models went on sale in the UK last Friday, prompting fans to queue

overnight outside London's Covent Garden store.



The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are the first models to sport pressure-sensitive

screens, which is utilised through the company's 3D Touch technology, opening

new shortcut menus depending on the pressure applied to the display. Both units'

rear-facing cameras were upgraded from 8MP to 12MP, whilst the front-facing

FaceTime camera was boosted from 1.2MP to 5MP.



Sales completed by last-Saturday will be included in Apple's 2015 fourth quarter

fiscal results, whilst sales from Sunday onwards will be included in the first

2016 quarterly results.
