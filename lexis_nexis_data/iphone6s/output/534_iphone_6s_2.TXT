New Delhi, Sept. 3 -- According to Forbes, a Chinese website with a reliable
track record of Apple leak, has new information on the iPhone 7?s pricing in
China and Hong Kong.

Apparently, Apple will sell its usual three storage models of the iPhone 7 at
5,288 RMB, 6,088 RMB, and 7,088 RMB, and HK$5,588, HK$6,388, HK$7,388. These
prices are comparable to the price of the iPhone 6S.

It is in fact cheaper when you see that Apple has doubled the storage of all
three models. Whereas the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus came in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB
variants, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will ship with 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage.

If the leaks are true, then more consumers will go for the new phone than
choosing to buy a cheaper iPhone 6S.
