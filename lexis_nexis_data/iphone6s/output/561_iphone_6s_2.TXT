Apple announced a slew of new products yesterday including the much leaked

iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. The two new handsets features the new A9 processor

and 3D Touch technology that, like Apple Watch, can gauge the pressure

sensitivity of a tap and accordingly allow you access to new functions. The

camera on the iPhone 6S has also been upgraded to 12MP on the back and 5MP on

the front. While the design looks the same as the iPhone 6, Apple has added a

new Rose Gold colour.



Besides the iPhone 6S, Apple also announced the new iPad Pro which is a addition

to the iPad line-up. Featuring a 12-inch retina display, the iPad Pro can also

accept input from a Stylus which will be sold separately as Apple Pencil. Apple

is also releasing a keyboard for the new iPad Pro. The tablet will feature the

A9X processor and four speakers that can adjust the volume based on how you're

holding the device.



Finally, Apple also updated the Apple TV box with a new remote control and an A8

processor. Apple TV will come with an App Store as well as Siri integration to

allow you to issue voice controls. The remote will also come with a touch

sensitive area to navigate. Apple showcased a few games and apps on the new

Apple TV.



While the Apple Watch wasn't upgraded, Apple will release the sports version in

Gold and Rose Gold colours along with a new set of straps. Apple has worked with

Hermes to create a set of fashionable bands for Apple Watch.



The new Watch OS2 is expected to be released on September 16 which will bring

native apps to the Apple Watch. On the same day, iOS 9 is also expected to be

released for previous generation of devices.
