10 users among them as well). And with the iPhone 6s, and its new features on
both models, Apple is expected to keep the sales momentum going, even if these
were subtle improvements at best.

The iPhone 6s has taken a big leap in terms of hardware as expected. And this
will boost buyer confidence thanks to the new 3D Touch feature, which seems
gimmicky at first, but will attract buyers when combined with the improved
hardware.

For now the prices have been announced for the US market. But that does not keep
us from taking at shot at guessing its estimated prices in India. This is more
so, because it was a similar scenario with the iPhone 6 launch last year.

So here are the estimated iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus prices keeping last
year's announcement and launch differences in mind.

iPhone 6s:

16 GB: US Price : Rs 43,246 : est. India Price: Rs 56,746

64 GB: US Price: Rs 49,909 : est. India Price: Rs 66,409

128 GB: US Price: Rs 56,573 : est. India Price: Rs 76,073

iPhone 6s Plus:

16 GB: US Price: Rs 49,909 : est. India Price: Rs 66,409

64 GB: US Price: Rs 56,573 : est. India Price: Rs 76,073

128 GB: US Price: Rs 63,236 : est. India Price: Rs 85,736

Both models will be available in Space Gray, Silver, Gold and the new Rose Gold
option.

Pre-orders in the US begin from the 12th of September. Currently, the Apple
India website has a 'coming soon' banner posted on its product pages, but expect
things to change in a week or so with an expected launch date.

We expect pre-orders to begin around the 7th of October like last year. This is
expected to happen within a month's time, considering Apple's growing interest

l) in the Indian smartphone market.
