Apple never failed to wow its audiences (and this time there were many Windows

10 users among them as well). And with the iPhone 6s, and its new features on

both models, Apple is expected to keep the sales momentum going, even if these

were subtle improvements at best.



The iPhone 6s has taken a big leap in terms of hardware as expected. And this

will boost buyer confidence thanks to the new 3D Touch feature, which seems

gimmicky at first, but will attract buyers when combined with the improved

hardware.



For now the prices have been announced for the US market. But that does not keep

us from taking at shot at guessing its estimated prices in India. This is more

so, because it was a similar scenario with the iPhone 6 launch last year.



So here are the estimated iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus prices keeping last

year's announcement and launch differences in mind.



iPhone 6s:



16 GB: US Price : Rs 43,246 : est. India Price: Rs 56,746



64 GB: US Price: Rs 49,909 : est. India Price: Rs 66,409



128 GB: US Price: Rs 56,573 : est. India Price: Rs 76,073



iPhone 6s Plus:



16 GB: US Price: Rs 49,909 : est. India Price: Rs 66,409



64 GB: US Price: Rs 56,573 : est. India Price: Rs 76,073



128 GB: US Price: Rs 63,236 : est. India Price: Rs 85,736



Both models will be available in Space Gray, Silver, Gold and the new Rose Gold

option.



Pre-orders in the US begin from the 12th of September. Currently, the Apple

India website has a 'coming soon' banner posted on its product pages, but expect

things to change in a week or so with an expected launch date.



We expect pre-orders to begin around the 7th of October like last year. This is

expected to happen within a month's time, considering Apple's growing interest

l) in the Indian smartphone market.
