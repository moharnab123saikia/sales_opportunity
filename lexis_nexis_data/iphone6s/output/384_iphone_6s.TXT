Introducing Better Way to Always have New iPhone: Verizon's New Annual Upgrade

Plan



LENGTH: 263  words





Sept. 24 -- If you purchase either the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus with

Verizon's Device Payment option beginning Friday, September 25, you'll be

eligible to get a new iPhone every year.  Yes, no more waiting for your contract

to end.  Now you can always have the latest iPhone - on the network that has the

largest 4G LTE coverage in America.



The new program allows you to turn in your phone and upgrade to a new iPhone

every year. If you pre-ordered an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, you're

automatically enrolled in this program if you've elected the Device Payment

option.



If you're not interested in upgrading, you still have the option to pay your

phone off in 24 low monthly payments.  That's a better option than those "lease

plans" offered by other companies, which can include surprise balloon payments

just 18 months into your agreement, or ask you to turn over your phone without

getting anything for it.



Not with Verizon and thinking about joining America's largest and most reliable

4G LTE network? You can get up to $400 when you switch and trade in your old

smartphone. Check out the details here: www.verizonwireless.com/iphone.



Now you can always have the latest iPhone on the network that has the largest 4G

LTE coverage in America.  Because the best deserves the best.



Beginning Friday, September 25, you can buy iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus at

Verizon retail stores and online at www.verizonwireless.com. For complete

details on pricing, please visit www.verizonwireless.com/iphone. For more

information on iPhone, please visit: www.apple.com/iphone.
