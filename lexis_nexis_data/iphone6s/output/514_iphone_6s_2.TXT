Apple unveils an Internet TV system and new iPhone 6S

(AP) -- Apple staked a new claim to the living room as the maker of iPhones and

other hand-held gadgets unveiled an Internet TV system that's designed as a

beachhead for the tech giant's broader ambitions to deliver a wide range of

information, games, music and video to the home.



CEO Tim Cook and other executives also showed off two new iPhone models, a

plus-sized iPad with detachable keyboard and updated software for the Apple

Watch during a two-hour event in San Francisco's Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.



Apple is counting on sales of the new iPhones to maintain its position as one of

the most profitable, and valuable, companies in the world. But it's the new

Apple TV system that some analysts point to as an important step for the company

as Cook attempts to build a business that doesn't rely so heavily on the iPhone.



"Apple is laying the groundwork for a broader living-room strategy" said analyst

Ben Bajarin from the research firm Creative Strategies. Apple wants to make the

already-important TV screen into an essential hub for communication and

entertainment, he said.



"TV plays a huge role in our lives and it occupies an important place in our

homes," Cook said during his presentation. He added that Apple believes "the

future of television is apps" that deliver streaming video, games and other

services.



For now, however, the iPhone is still Apple's most important product. Sales of

the iconic smartphone contributed more than two-thirds of the Cupertino,

California, company's $107 billion in revenue during the first half of 2015.



Apple announced that it will sell two new iPhone models, dubbed the 6s and 6s

Plus, starting Sept. 25. They're roughly the same size and will cost the same as

the record-selling 6 and 6 Plus models introduced last year, which will now sell

for $100 less. The new iPhones will have more memory, faster processors, and a

new 12 mega-pixel camera.



Perhaps the most noticeable upgrade, however, is the addition of "3D Touch," a

feature that uses added screen sensors to detect the difference between a light

tap and extended finger pressure, triggering different menus and functions for

apps made by Apple and outside developers.



Some analysts have questioned how compelling the new features will be. Apple

sold more than 183 million iPhones since the last models were introduced in

2014, which is 40 percent more than it sold in the same period a year earlier.

"That's one big concern about Apple, that it's so dependent on the iPhone," said

Jerry Kim, a Columbia University management professor.



"The smartphone market is headed for a peak, and everyone is going to be feeling

that," said Bob O'Donnell, a veteran consumer tech analyst with Technalysis

Research. "So Apple has got to diversify."



Cook, while insisting there is room for iPhone sales to grow, has begun pushing

into new product categories. In addition to the Apple Watch, introduced earlier

this year, executives spent time showing off the new Apple TV. The new device

has a more powerful processor and updated software for running Internet apps and

games on TVs, along with streaming music and video. It will start at $149 and

will be available in late October.



An integral part of Apple's system is a hand-held remote that can be controlled

with a touch screen and voice commands, allowing users to request information

and search for music, movies or TV shows by using Apple's electronic personal

assistant, Siri.
