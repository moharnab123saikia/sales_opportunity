With just days to go before the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus go on sale,Â both models

are currently sold out on Apple's official website. This of course shouldn't

come as too much of a surprise for two reasons. First, each successive iPhone

model has historically performed better than the model before it. Second, Apple

noted last week that first-weekend sales of its new iPhone models are on pace to

break the 10 million unit record Apple set last year with the iPhone 6 launch.



Set to go on sale this Friday, the iPhone 6s is a compelling upgrade in every

regard. While 'S' upgrades in the refresh cycle may be viewed as incremental in

nature, Apple managed to pack a number of intriguing features into the 6s. Of

course, the most intriguing new feature prospective iPhone users can look

forward to is 3D Touch, a technology which enables the iPhone to detect varying

levels of pressure on the screen.



Other noteworthy features include a 4K camera, an improved rear-facing 12

megapixel camera, improved Touch ID and more.



Come Monday morning, it's a safe bet that Apple will issue a press release

announcing a new iPhone sales record.



As a final point, and speaking to the pent up demand for the iPhone 6s and 6s

Plus, customers in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Oregon, Delaware, New Hampshire, and

Alaska can only purchase the device via a reservation. The aforementioned four

states are singled out because they don't have any statewide sales tax.

Consequently, Apple is trying to prevent enterprising individuals from buying

iPhones in bulk there and then selling them for profit to individuals in other

states.
