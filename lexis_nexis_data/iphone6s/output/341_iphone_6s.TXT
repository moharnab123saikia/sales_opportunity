Donate sperm instead of a kidney for an iPhone 6s



The joke goes that some Chinese people would donate a kidney for an iPhone 6s,

but perhaps something less costly - sperm - might get you one too. A sperm bank

in Central China's Hubei province said it would reward donors with an iPhone 6s

on its official WeChat account on Sept 14, Changjiang Times reported.



By 5:00pm on Monday, the WeChat message had been read 1,379 times. Two more

sperm banks in Shanghai also posted similar advertisements in the following

days, read over 400,000 times. However, the report did not say how many men had

actually provided sperm donations after reading the WeChat posts.



"We are looking for donors aged between 22 to 45. 5,000 yuan ($785) will be paid

for 40 ml sample of semen(the iPhone 6s is priced at 5,288 yuan on the

mainland)," the Hubei Human Sperm Bank posted beneath a photo of an iPhone 6s.

The social media posts have stirred controversy, with some saying sperm donation

is a public welfare undertaking which should not be motivated by commercial

gain, while others think it was a good way to encourage more to donate.



The recruitment of sperm donors has been difficult, said Doctor Zhu, with the

Hubei Sperm Bank, as sperm banks are not allowed to advertise on social media.



China has strict rules on the founding and managing of sperm banks, allowing

only one in each province. Lack of sperm donations has been a major issue at all

18 centers nationwide.

Man invents hair-washing machine



A 38-year-old man in Southwest China has invented an automatic hair-washing

machine and received a national patent after experimenting for 16 years,

breaking 18 motorcycle helmets, Chengdu Business Daily reported.



The hair-washing machine consists of a motorcycle helmet, two water tanks and a

control panel.



The whole process of using the machine takes place in several stages. First,

water and shampoo must be sprayed in the helmets, and at the end hot air is

blown through the helmet to dry the hair.



Cheng Gongke, the inventor, said he had the idea because he wanted to make it

easier for his paralyzed grandma to wash her hair. Though it has taken him more

than a decade, his dream has finally come true.

Eight-ton tofu served in Anhui



Tofu fans had a bite of an eight-ton tofu at an event in Huainan city, East

China's Anhui province on Tuesday.



It took more than 50 workers seven hours to complete the super-large tofu, which

is 3.64 meters long, 3.62 meters wide and 0.4 meters tall.



Huainan city is home to tofu, which was invented in the Western Han Dynasty (206

BC-24AD), though mapo tofu has become a popular Chinese dish at home and abroad.

Drone to deliver goods within one hour after purchase



A logistics company in Shandong has successfully tested a new super-fast

delivery service that uses drones, and will ensure delivery within an hour of

purchase, China Post News reported on Tuesday.



The tested EMS delivery by China Post arrived within an hour via a drone in

front of a dormitory at Shandong Normal University on Sept 2, after the order

was placed on EMS online.



Amazon previously announced a future "Prime Air" delivery service and it seems

that Chinese logistics companies are hot on their heels.
