iPhone 7: UK release date, price, news and rumours - everything about Apple's

next phone;

Apple's iPhone 6s may only be a few months old, but there's already plenty of

speculation on what 2016's model will bring

The Apple iPhone 6s was, as we all expected, a massive hit for the world's most

valuable company.



Apple tinkered and changed a few things for its newest smartphone, introducing

cool new features like 3D touch and Live pictures.



But it doesn't take long for the technology world to start speculating on what

the next iteration will bring.



Mere months after Apple's big event in San Francisco, internet rumours are

already starting to circulate about an upcoming iPhone 7.



We've gathered together all the latest news and rumours into one place and will

continue to update this as we learn more.



Taking Apple's release date history into account, it's likely we'll see the

iPhone 7 officially revealed in September 2016.



Both the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6 were revealed in September and Apple has no

reason to change its strategy.



There's also nothing wrong with taking advantage of Black Friday sales and the

run up to Christmas.



If we had to be specific, we would estimate the announcement date for the iPhone

7 being on a Wednesday or a Thursday in either the first or second week of

September.



The iPhone 6s announcement was held on September 9, 2015 and Apple could plan a

repeat performance.



Apple's iPhone 6s has been a big hit for the technology giant - but it didn't

alter much when it came to design.



That could be about to change as rumours suggest next year's model may drop the

iconic home button on the front of the gadget.



Designers around the world are speculating on what Apple has planned and one

artist, Marek Weidlich, has created an intriguing concept.



Weidlich has turned the entire front of the futuristic smartphone into a screen

- leaving no home button or any visible bezel.



"I focused on simple design language which is very important for Apple,"

Weidlich said.



"I designed a curved display without a bezel, and equipped with a software home

button."



Both Samsung and LG have embraced curvy screens with the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge

and the LG G Flex 2 respectively.



It's unlikely Apple will follow suit but then the world's most valuable company

has frequently had a problem with bending phones.



Screen size is perhaps the most contentious issue.



Apple's last two releases have been with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens. This

covers a broad range and the tech giant could decide to keep things as they are.



Because the new iPhone will likely arrive with Apple's yet-to-be-confirmed iOS

10 software and an upgraded processor, it will offer even more power and better

efficiency.



Likely to be boasting a processor called the A10 chip, the iPhone 7 will surely

boast more power - although it's anyone's guess as to how much this will

translate into actual usage.



At the moment, we don't know what kind of battery the iPhone 7 will use - but at

least there's now a Low Power Mode built into iOS 9 to help it last even longer.

We expect this will continue into an updated version of iOS.



According to Korean site ETNews, Apple is currently in discussion with

arch-rival Samsung over supplying OLED screens for its next phone.



This would shift the display over from the current LED model to a much more

vibrant OLED screen. Such a move would likely make for better colour

reproduction for videos and games, but might hamper battery life.



It's unlikely that Apple's main iPhone 7 will be any easier on the wallet than

past variants.



Most experts reckon the new iPhone will start at £539 for a 16GB model,

effectively taking the place of the current iPhone 6s - which will see an

incremental drop in price.



If true, we could expect other models with larger storage - 64GB and 128GB most

likely - to stick with the £619 and £699 prices.
