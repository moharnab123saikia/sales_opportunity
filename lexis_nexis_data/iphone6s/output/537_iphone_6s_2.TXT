APPLE TAKES ON TV

APPLE yesterday promised a day of "monster" announcements and delivered, with a

giant iPad, a revamped smarter Apple TV and two new -iPhones that are smarter,

faster and tougher than ever.



In one of its biggest days of hardware announcements in recent years, Apple CEO

Tim Cook unveiled the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, the 12-inch iPad Pro and a revamped

Apple TV which, with its own app store, is Apple's push to grab a slice of the

$48.5 billion games market.



In what is likely the last Apple event in a year that began with the Apple

Watch, the launch of two new iPhones also got lost in announcements led by

Apple's promise to bring "innovation" to TVs through a TV app store.



The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus look the same on the outside, with a 4.7-inch screen

for the 6S and a 5.5-inch screen for the bigger phablet.



But under the bonnet the new iPhones have significant improvements, including a

tougher aluminium body and glass to avoid the problems of Bendgate in which some

people reported bending their iPhone 6 Plus smartphones.



The new phones have 3D Touch, which lets you quickly access features of the

phone by applying extra force as you touch the touchscreen, plus a 12-megapixel

camera, a big jump from the 8-megapixel camera in the iPhone 6. Selfie fans will

appreciate an upgrade to the front-facing camera to 5 megapixels plus the

ability to use the glow of the touchscreen as a front-facing flash.



Apple made a push into productivity yesterday with an iPad Pro, a 12-inch tablet

that lets you view apps side-by-side in split-screen, that it hopes is a step

towards reviving a stagnate tablet market.



Potentially the biggest announcement of the event was the launch of a new Apple

TV, with an app store that will allow third-party app makers to transfer popular

games, news, entertainment and lifestyle apps from mobile devices to television

screens.

iPhone The iPhone 6S ($1079-$1370) and iPhone 6S Plus ($1229 to $1529) go on

preorder tomorrow and will be available on 25 September. Features include 3D

Touch, a 12-megapixel camera, ability to shoot 4K video, and a tougher body.



Apple TVApple TV updates the older Apple TV box with a box that looks just a bit

bigger. Inside it's a lot smarter, with Siri for voice control, a smart remote

with a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope for gameplay and it will come with

an app store. Pricing and availability to be announced.
