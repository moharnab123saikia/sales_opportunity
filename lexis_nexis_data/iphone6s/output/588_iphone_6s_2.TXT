Chennai, Sept. 18 -- Apple TV

When Steve Jobs introduced the first Apple TV, he referred to it as a hobby.
Seven years later, it is ready to take a starring role in our living rooms. And
it all comes to down to three things. One is the introduction of an app store
and the ability for app developers to make exciting new apps for the TV. Second
is a completely redesigned remote with a built-in trackpad that makes navigating
through apps on the TV very easy and work as a motion sensor so you can play
games with it. The third and the most important is the deep integration of Siri
into the TV so you can search for content, get weather updates and even rewind
using the virtual assistant. With Siri clever enough to know all the James Bond
movies starring Sean Connery, the inclusion of apps like Apple Music and games
like Asphalt 8, the new Apple TV promises to completely transform TV viewing.
When it is available later this year, the Apple TV will come in 32 and 64 GB
configurations.

iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus

After the success of last year's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, it was obvious that
Apple would this year release the tock version with the names iPhone 6S and the
iPhone 6S Plus. Though the aluminium and its finish looks very similar to
previous iPhones, Apple claims that the new iPhones are made from a stronger
grade of 7000 series aluminium so the phones don't bend. The biggest upgrade is
the inclusion of 3D Touch, which lets users interact with elements on their
iPhone's screen by applying varying degrees of pressure. A simple tap on the
phone icon brings up the phone dailer, a harder press brings up a menu with most
favoured contacts. A harder press on the Facebook app will let users post an
update, a harder touch on a URL in a message will bring up the corresponding
website as a pop-up without having to go out of the messages app.

The camera has been upgraded to 12 MP, capable of taking exquisite photos and
recording 4K video. Other improvements include a faster Touch ID sensor, faster
processor and better wireless connectivity. The iPhone 6S has a 4.7-inch screen
and the iPhone 6S Plus has a 5.5-inch one. Both run on iOS 9 and are available
in 16, 64 and 128 GB configurations.

Apple Watch

The Apple Watch sport is now available in the same gold and rose gold colours as
the iPhones and has also gotten a bevy of new bands in beautiful colours ranging
from blue to vibrant red in collaboration with Bono's Product RED charity. The
steel Apple Watches get some new beautiful leather bands and Apple has also
teamed up with the luxury brand Hermes to produce some unique leather bands as
well as Hermes themed watch faces for the steel Apple Watch.

iPad Pro with Apple Pencil

iPads are becoming very important computing devices in the enterprise and in the
academic worlds. Apple wants to take it to the next level and wants to make sure
that the iPad becomes the de facto laptop replacement for the generations that
grew up with iOS. To the effect, Apple has introduced the iPad Pro. With a
12.9-inch screen packing more than six million pixels it has 78 per cent more
screen area than the iPad Air 2, and processing power that gives most laptop
computers a run for their money. It is unlike any other iPads and is
purposefully built for creating content rather consuming it. It has four new
high-fidelity speakers built into the aluminium unibody so you can edit a 4K
movie, play a game or watch a movie with great sound. Available in space grey,
silver and gold colours, the iPad Pro is super thin, lightweight and runs iOS 9.
This operating system has been tweaked to be most useful on the iPad by allowing
for two apps to run simultaneously side by side and other features like
Pro-active Siri virtual assistant. You can also get a purpose built keyboard
from Apple that easily connects to the iPad using three magnetic connectors or
even a stylus called the Apple Pencil which can sense force and acts just like a
real pencil with zero lag.
