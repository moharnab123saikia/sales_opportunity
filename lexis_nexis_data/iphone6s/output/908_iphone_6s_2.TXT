Ahmedabad: Spending anywhere between Rs60,000 and Rs2 lakh after a smartphone

isn't what every Amdavadi might do! However, there is a bunch of iPhone-loving

Amdavadis for whom splurging huge amounts to get their smart devices

aesthetically customised isn't really a big deal. On the midnight of October 16,

several Amdavadis queued up before mobile phone shops, electronics retailers and

Apple stores across the city to their iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which are priced

from Rs62,000 and goes up to Rs92,000.



A city-based mobile phone dealer, Vaishal Shah, said, "People spend an

additional Rs60,000 apart from the cost of the phone to get their devices

studded with diamonds or get gold plating, rose gold plating, and carbon plating

on the body of the phone."



Shah claims to have sold around 88 iPhone 6s and 6s plus which were

aesthetically customised. Even though these devices are iPhones, they are not

covered under warranty by Apple. Instead, the Swiss company which customizes the

iPhones provides buyers with a year-long warranty.



Shah claims that he is the only dealer of such customised iPhones in Gujarat. He

claims to sell around four to five devices each month.
