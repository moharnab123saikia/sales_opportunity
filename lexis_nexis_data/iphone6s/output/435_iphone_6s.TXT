Apple said Monday it sold 13 million of its new iPhones over the weekend, in a

record-breaking launch for the newest models of its iconic smartphone.

On Monday, the company said the devices will be available in 40 additional

markets October 9 including Italy, Mexico, Russia, Spain and Taiwan.



Sales for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any

previous first weekend sales results in Apple's history," said chief executive

Tim Cook.



Apple has also unveiled new lease and finance terms for US customers, which

analysts said could boost sales and shorten the upgrade cycle, at a time when

carriers are moving away from smartphone subsidies.



The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus have the same overall dimensions as the last version,

with new technologies under the hood.

One of the key new features is called 3D touch," which responds to pressure

exerted on the screen to allow users to look inside messages and applications.



The 6S has the 4.7-inch (about 12-centimeter) display of its predecessor and the

6S Plus  which updates one of the more popular handsets in the phablet category"

has the same 5.5-inch screen.



But the devices have more powerful processors that allow for improved graphics,

harder glass and a new aluminum body. Pricing will be kept at the same levels as

the earlier versions.
