yet, Apple's latest smartphone does offer a few significant improvements,
especially on the photo and video side.

3D Touch technology

Just like its predecessor, the iPhone 6S has a 4.7 inch Retina HD display
(1334x750 pixels), now equipped with 3D Touch technology. This proprietary tech,
a derivative of the Force Touch found on the Macbook and Apple Watch, allows
users to control various functions depending on the pressure applied to the
screen.

New cameras
 Apple needed to take a giant step forward with its photo capabilities, so the
iPhone 6S now has a 12MP main camera (iSight) that is a significant step up from
the iPhone 6's 8MP. It also now includes the Live Photos feature that captures
the moments just before and after your picture and sets it in motion with just
the press of a finger. As for the front-facing camera (the FaceTime camera),
it's been upgraded to 5MP and can film in 1080p.

4K video
 As for video, Apple has introduced 4K filming (3840x2160 pixels) as well as
slow motion capture at a rate of 120 frames per second in HD (1080p). You can
also take 8MP photos while filming in 4K.

A new color
 In addition to silver, space grey and gold, the iPhone 6S (as well as the 6S
Plus) is also available in a new color, pink gold.
