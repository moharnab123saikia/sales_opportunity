

APPLE has enjoyed "phenomenal" sales of the newlylaunched iPhone 6s and iPhone
6s Plus, according to chief executive Tim Cook, selling more than 13m units
within three days of availability.

The sales figures surpass last year's 10m iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sales within the
same three-day period.

Mr Cook said: "Customers' feedback is incredible and they are loving 3D Touch
and Live Photos, and we can't wait to bring iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to
customers in even more countries on October 9." For the first time, China was
among the first countries to carry the new iPhones from release.

Previously, customers in China had to wait several weeks or months before new
models were approved for sale.

China is estimated to have accounted for between 2m and 2.5m unit sales, meaning
non-China sales rose by between 5pc and 10pc, according to analysts FBR & Co.

The new models went on sale in the UK last Friday, prompting fans to queue
overnight outside London's Covent Garden store.

The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are the first models to sport pressure-sensitive
screens, which is utilised through the company's 3D Touch technology, opening
new shortcut menus depending on the pressure applied to the display. Both units'
rear-facing cameras were upgraded from eight mega-pixels (MP) to 12MP, while the
front-facing FaceTime camera was boosted from 1.2MP to 5MP.

Sales completed by last-Saturday will be included in Apple's 2015 fourth-quarter
fiscal results, while sales from Sunday onwards will be included in the first
2016 quarterly results.
