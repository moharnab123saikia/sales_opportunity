Tim Cook: New iPhones look "familiar," but Apple has "changed everything" about

them

Apple launched its next-generation iPhone models - iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus

- at its product launch event held in San Francisco on September 9.



Announcing the new iPhones, Apple CEO Tim Cook tried to convince the attendees

that the handsets boast the inclusion of impressive new features, and are

outstandingly 'different' from the current iPhone 6 models.



Cook told the audience at the event that though the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus

models "may look familiar" to their predecessors, Apple has "changed everything"

about the new handsets.



The 'familiar' look of the new iPhones results from the fact that the handsets

are largely the same as the iPhone 6 models, except for some cosmetic changes as

well as the introduction of a few new internal features, which can apparently be

described as force multipliers.



So far as the changes made by Apple to the new iPhones - vis-a-vis the present

iPhones - are concerned, these changes mainly include a faster processor;

pressure-sensitive 3D Touch screen technology; a new 12-megapixel 'iSight' rear

camera; a 5-megapixel front camera; a tougher glass face; and a chassis made of

a comparatively less bendable version of the custom aluminum alloy.



Since the mentioned new features of the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus handsets do

not, strictly speaking, imply that "everything" about the new handsets has been

changed, it is apparent that the 'S' branded new iPhones are poor cousins of

Apple's iPhone 6 flagship handsets launched last year.
