The iPhone 6s's new 3D Touch feature will foster loyalty among existing Apple

users, making it less likely they will defect to -Android, technology research

firm Telsyte has said.



On Saturday, Apple will begin selling iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus whose

signature features -include pressing harder on the display to access new

functionality. Apple calls the gesture 3D Touch and has built new smartphone

displays capable of detecting different levels of pressure as users press it.



Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi said features such as Force Touch might

not cause iPhone users to upgrade their phones, but it would help keep users

loyal to Apple.



"It's these kind of features that make the platform even more sticky for users.

It (the iPhone) is a game changer because it solidifies Apple's users on their

own platform. It's making it less likely for a user to switch to Android because

it just doesn't have that feature." Third-party developers already have

announced they will implement 3D Touch and another new feature on iPhone 6s,

live photos, in new versions of their apps. With live photos, the iPhone camera

shoots a short three-second video clip as it takes a photo.



Instagram, Pinterest, Sky Guide, Dropbox, Facebook, Getty Images, PixelToys,

ZORG, WeChat and Weibo are among apps that will issue updated versions to

support the new features. Facebook told The Australian it would implement both

features. "We are excited to explore options for using the new iOS 3D touch so

people can quickly and easily take actions on Facebook like updating their

status and taking photos," a Facebook spokesman said.



Mr Fadaghi said that based on consumer surveys and its assessment of the

smartphone market, Telsyte estimated Apple would sell about 1.9 million handsets

in Australia in the second half of this year. That figure included all models,

not just the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.



About 4.5 million handsets of all types would be sold in that period overall.

"While Apple's repeat purchase intention is still the highest in the industry,

it has come down a few points in the last survey that we did; instead of being

in the 80 per cents, it's in the 70s now," he said. Cost was likely to be one

reason.



In the US, meanwhile, Apple chief executive Tim Cook is reported to have offered

a 17-year-old US high school footballer a free iPhone and a summer internship at

Apple headquarters after he publicly praised Apple Watch for saving his

life.After experiencing chest and back pains after training, Paul Houle measured

his heart rate on Apple Watch, which recorded it at 145. He immediately went to

a hospital and was diagnosed with heart, liver and kidney failure.
