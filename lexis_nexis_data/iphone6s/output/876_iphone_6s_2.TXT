A pair of rumors earlier this week both point to Apple releasing its next-gen

iPhone on Friday, September 18.



First off, the Japanese language blog ITHome reports that Apple's big iPhone

unveiling event is set to take place on Wednesday, September 9. This of course

jibes with a previous report which pegged September 9 as the date of a big Apple

event. The report further adds that iPhone 6s preorders will open up on Friday,

September 11 to soon be followed by a worldwide launch seven days later on

September 18.



While Apple hasn't yet made anything official via its traditional event

invitations, the dates above sure do fit Apple's historic pattern of iPhone

releases over the last few years.



Echoing ITHome's report, the German-language Macerkopf also relays that Apple is

eyeing September 18 as a launch date for the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus.



As the old saying goes, when there's smoke there's fire, which is to say it's a

pretty good bet that you can pencil in September 18 as a day you might want to

keep open.



As we've covered previously, Apple is reportedly planning to unveil more than

just two new iPhone models come September 9. Specifically, it's widely believed

that Apple will also take some time to unveil a refreshed iPad lineup --

including the rumored iPad Pro -- alongside a completely revamped Apple TV.



While Apple's long-rumored TV subscription service is reportedly on hold for the

time being, an Apple TV refresh has not only been a long time coming, but is

apparently coming at just the right time. To wit, a recent report from Park

Associates finds that the Apple TV is now the fourth most popular streaming

media device in the U.S., trailing behind Roku, Google Chromecast, and Amazon's

Fire TV. Previously, the Apple TV checked in at third before being overtaken by

Amazon.
