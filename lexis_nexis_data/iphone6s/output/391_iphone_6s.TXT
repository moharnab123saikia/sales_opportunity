

In a Monday announcement, tech biggie Apple has revealed that it is expanding
its iPhone Upgrade Program to include online purchases of iPhone.

According to the announcement, prospective iPhone buyers who want to purchase a
new iPhone 6s or 6s Plus handset from the Apple website can now avail the
benefits of the company's iPhone Upgrade Program.

The iPhone Upgrade Program is Apple's two-year interest-free payment plan which
enables customers to trade in their old iPhones for a next-generation model. The
program is currently limited to Apple's present-generation flagship handsets -
iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.

The program was announced by Apple in coincidence with the launch of the new
iPhones in 2015. The program originally enabled customers to trade up to the new
iPhones in brick-and-mortar Apple Stores. However, now Apple has expanded the
program to include online iPhone purchases as well.

Under the terms of the iPhone Upgrade Program, customers can purchase a brand
new, unlocked iPhone 6s -- with AppleCare+ warranty coverage -- for only $32.41
per month for 24 months. The customers also have the option to trade in their
handset for a next-generation model at no extra cost, after they have completed
12 monthly installments.
