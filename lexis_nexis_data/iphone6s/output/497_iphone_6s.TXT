Is the iPhone 7 a worthy upgrade?

Hyderabad, Sept. 15 -- The disappearance of the 3.5mm audio socket and the

rework of the home button were already staple mentions on gossip columns and

tech websites much before the launch of the iPhone 7. Steve Jobs would have been

furious with such laxity.





 Yet, there are a few surprising new features in the pair of new iPhones that

Apple unveiled last week. Design is certainly not one of them. The overall look

and shape of the new iPhones have remained the same over the past three

iterations, save the changes to the antenna line in the new ones.

 So, should you go in for the upgrade if you already own an iPhone? And if you

are planning to jump ship from Android, are the upgrades in the iPhone 7 and 7

Plus worth emptying your wallet for upward of [#x20b9]60,000? Or should you wait

for that deal on the 6s?

 Design and display

 The screen on the iPhone 7 is the same Retina HD display as on the 6s - it's

just that it's now 25 per cent brighter and shows a wider gamut of colours.

 The new Home button with Taptic engine feedback could be an interesting

addition, but it is too fringe to become a factor influencing a buy call. A

similar point would be the new dust and water resistance feature, where Apple is

by now only a follower, not a trendsetter. The new Jet Black body finish looks

awesome in pictures, but our guess is that if you are a heavy user, the matt

black might be the one to choose. The super glossy Jet Black finish is

guaranteed to be prone to fingerprints and scratches.

 Upgraded camera

 The iPhone 7 gets a new 12MP camera with an f/1.8 aperture lens and optical

image stabilisation. This is a big jump in performance over the 6s, because the

new lens will allow more light into the sensor (50 per cent more than 6s) and

the optical stabilisation will deliver much better results than the kind of

stabilisation that can be achieved by software. So, low light photography should

produce much better, less grainy results. Flash photos should be better too

thanks to the the quad LEDs. But, it is the iPhone 7 Plus that gets two cameras

positioned side by side and both 12MP each. This arrangement is meant to deliver

greater depth to your photos and to be able to generate that key 'Bokah' effect

for portraits and close-ups. But, one capability that will be unique to the 7

Plus is optical zoom upto 2X.

 The new cameras are great but unless you're quite a phone photography

enthusiast, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus cameras are fantastic in themselves. There

are a lot of apps that can also help add depth and Bokeh in post-processing.

 Processor power

 The iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion chip offers an incremental improvement in

processing power, graphics speeds and battery efficiency. The numbers are only

impressive compared to the iPhone 6 and much less attractive when compared to

the 6s. So, unless you are an Apple loyalist or a performance addict, the 6s'

performance should suffice from the perspective of processing power. That would

be the recommendation even if you are big into gaming on your phone.

 But, the reason the iPhone 7 could be more attractive is the doubling of

memory. With apps taking over our lives, the need for higher capacity has never

been more urgent. And there are no memory cards with Apple devices, so the

larger capacity is most welcome. With the iPhone 7's camera capable of shooting

in RAW format and also taking 4K videos the larger memory will definitely be

useful. Many of today's games take up space and even their updates (like Asphalt

8 Airborne's) are larger than 1GB.

 Sound of music

 The stereo speakers on the iPhone 7 are welcome, not so the elimination of the

3.5mm audio socket. But then, you can't complain since Apple is including the

lightning to 3.5mm adapter in the box. Also, with the lighting socket doubling

up as the audio port and with the possibility of it delivering power for

headphones with active noise cancellation, this could turn out to be a blessing

eventually.

 Down to cash

 True iPhone fans need little persuasion to move to the next version. But it

comes down to whether you want to spend the cash on an iteration of what already

works quite well. If you're using a really old version of the iPhone, and can

spare the money, certainly look at the new iPhone 7's. If not, wait for a good

deal on the iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. As far as software goes, the operating system

is now upgrading for everyone, with the release of iOS 10 and new features will

come in on old devices.
