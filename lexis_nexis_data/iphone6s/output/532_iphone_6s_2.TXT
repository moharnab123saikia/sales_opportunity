If you happen to own an iPhone 6 or select Samsung flagship phones, it's now

easier to get your hands on the new iPhones.



Less than a month since the launch of the latest iPhone, Apple India has made an

unprecedented decision to place a discount on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in a

buyback offer. The offer gives consumers a discount up to Rs 34,000 to improve

sales, according to a report by The Times Of India.



The iPhone 6S and 6 Plus were launched recently for a price ranging between Rs

62,000 and Rs 92,000. Sales of the new phone were lower than expected, showing a

15-20 percent decrease over the previous year. Not to mention last year's

models--the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus--are cheaper by Rs 8,500-9000.



Ingram Micro, one of Apple's iPhone distributors, has just started the buyback

scheme in a couple of Apple stores in South India which will successively be

taken to a national level.



The buyback offer of Rs 34,000 on the new iPhones is against iPhone 6. Apple

India will also buyback selected hi-end Samsung handsets. Retailers can upload

details of the old handsets for the offer on a separate website made by Apple.



Since last week, the iPhones are being sold at a 7-11 percent discount on online

shopping sites like Snapdeal, Amazon and Flipkart.



This is also the first instance when Apple and its distributors are going to buy

back old models under a scheme to ensure that all transactions are genuine and

reduce the burden of the retailer who can push sales further, said three senior

trade partners of Apple India.



The discounts are aimed at helping the company accelerate adoption of their new

phones, which is especially pertinent during the Diwali buying season.
