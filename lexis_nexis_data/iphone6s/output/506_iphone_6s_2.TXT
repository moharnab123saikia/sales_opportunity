Apple Inc. is predicting initial sales of its new iPhone models will top last

year's opening-weekend record, thanks largely to demand in China.



Preorders for iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were "very strong" and sales are on pace to

exceed last year's launch-weekend record of 10 million handsets, Apple said on

Monday. The devices, unveiled at an event in San Francisco last week, will hit

stores on Sept. 25.



The strong demand was aided by orders from China, which this year was added as

one of the countries to sell the smartphone at its introduction. Gene Munster,

an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos., said orders may be roughly flat if customers

in China weren't included in the initial availability. Munster is predicting

opening-weekend sales of as many as 13 million units, with China accounting for

about 2 million shipments.



Maintaining healthy demand for the iPhone is critical for Apple, which got more

than 60 percent of its revenue from the handsets in recent quarters. Analysts

have questioned whether the new models will be able to match the success of last

year's



record-setting release, when the company overhauled the design of the device

with bigger screens. Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG in New York, said the

early figures "should not be taken as strong evidence" that iPhone sales will

exceed last year's record output.



Apple shares rose 1 percent to $115.31 at the close in New York. The shares have

fallen 12 percent since July 21, when Apple released financial results that were

lower than analysts anticipated, sparking concerns about the company's ability

to keep up its torrid growth year after year. An economic slowdown in China, the

company's second-biggest market after the U.S., has added to the investor

hand-wringing.



Unlike last year, when Apple said it sold more than 4 million units during the

first 24 hours of orders, the company didn't give numbers this year. "Customer

response to iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been extremely positive and

preorders this weekend were very strong around the world," Apple spokeswoman

Trudy Muller said.



The new iPhone models add an improved camera, faster processor and a new feature

called 3D Touch that provides shortcuts to common tasks when applying stronger

pressure to the screen. In addition to the U.S. and China, the handsets will be

available in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto

Rico, Singapore and the U.K.
