According to a 9to5Mac report, early owners of Apple's new iPhone 6S handset --

which was launched on September 25 -- have been reporting an issue with their

devices. The issue which early iPhone 6S users are complaining about is that the

Touch ID/Home button of the handset becomes too hot to touch.



In an apparent substantiation of the 9to5Mac report, early iPhone 6S users have

complained about the 'burning hot Touch ID buttons' of their handsets in their

recent posts on Apple's Support forums as well as on the Twitter microblogging

site.



In a description of the Touch ID buttons issue, several early iPhone 6S owners

have said in a thread on Apple's Support Communities that when the new iPhone is

turned on, the home screen appears black and the Touch ID/Home button feels

quite hot.



However, the problem of hot Touch ID button is apparently resolved after

resetting the handset by holding the Home and lock buttons for 10 seconds.



Apple has thus far offered no official comment on the 'hot Touch ID buttons'

issue reported by the early iPhone 6S owners, probably because such small issues

are generally reported in early production devices and are patched via software

updates.
