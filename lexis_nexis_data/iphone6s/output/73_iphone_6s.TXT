Juha Saarinen: Gear Friday - going small with iPhone SE



SECTION: TECHNOLOGY; General



LENGTH: 624 words





Downsizing my iPhone from the 6S Plus to the new SE has been an interesting

experience.



I can now sit down in the car and elsewhere with the iPhone SE in my front

pocket without risking an injured undercarriage (the iPhone 6S Plus doesn"t bend

easily, believe me) and err, making the trouser line look strange.



Also, talking on the iPhone SE looks nicely retro and unobtrusive compared to

the phablet-sized iPhone 6S Plus.



Small really is better at times.



I can drive the 6S Plus mostly with one hand and thumb, but the iPhone SE is

that much easier to do that with, thanks to the smaller 4-inch screen.



For upgraders who felt the iPhone 6 and 6S are just too big, the SE is totally

worthwhile: the camera from iPhone 6S, faster processor and new radios (both

Wi-Fi and LTE) are great additions; also, Touch ID is actually much more useful

on the SE than on the iPhone 6S Plus, as my large fingers are more typo prone on

the smaller screen.



The smaller screen is the deal-breaker for me though: I"ve been spoilt by the

large 5.5-inch display on the iPhone 6S Plus which lets me view more things at

once with less scrolling and zooming around.



The iPhone SE had me wondering about the seemingly intractable problem of device

sizes having to be both large and small at the same time, to be practical to use

yet portable.



I can actually write pretty long documents on the iPhone 6S Plus by flipping it

on its side, and using the larger keyboard that appears on the screen and both

thumbs. A smaller, 4-inch screen would take a while to get used to - and unlike

the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus which have iOS Reachability features to help people

with small hands drive them, there"s nothing equivalent for us with

non-Trump-sized mitts on the iPhone SE to assist with the comparatively tiny

display.



If you can live with the smaller screen though, the iPhone SE is a great entry

into Apple"s iOS walled garden, and good value for money as a new device that

should keep going for the next two to three years easily.



The iPhone SE had me wondering about the seemingly intractable problem of device

sizes having to be both large and small at the same time, to be practical to use

yet portable.



I"m hoping the answer won"t be Siri or Cortana or another voice recognition

personal digital assistant, because having millions of people constantly talking

to their mobile devices would be a horrendous dystopia.



Purloining the Panama Papers a piece of cake



Silly me, I must stop assuming skills and cleverness are applied in situations

where taking advantage of carelessness and incompetence will do much better.



A global law firm like Mossack Fonseca, with lots of high-profile clients,

should make every effort to ensure that their IT systems are up to date and

secure, right? Bulletproof secrecy and all that.



Except it seems Mossack Fonseca didn"t, according to security experts Wired UK

spoke to.



The Panama Papers may have been leaked by an insider, or an outside hacker or a

government wanting to shed light on murky financial dealings worldwide; either

way, judging by how "holey" Mossack Fonseca"s systems are, whoever engineered

the data breach probably didn"t have to work very hard to gain access.



Nor is it likely that there were any form of intrusion detection systems active

to alert that the data was accessed: the Panama Papers data arrived over a

period of a year, in little bits and pieces, with nobody noticing.



Lax security practices among law firms are apparently not unusual. It wouldn"t

surprise me if opportunistic activists and even criminals pay greater attention

to legal beagles" internet-connected systems from now.



And accountants and... just about every single professional person or firm

holding sensitive information. Just something to think about.
