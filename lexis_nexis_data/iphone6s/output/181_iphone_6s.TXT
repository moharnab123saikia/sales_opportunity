NEW DELHI: Seems Apple is changing its India strategy. For the first time ever,

the US-based technology giant has discontinued its two-year older models in

India. Apple iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and older models have disappeared from the

company's India website.



This comes just hours after Apple launched its brand new iPhones -- iPhone 7 and

iPhone 7 Plus, at an event in San Francisco, California.Apart from the newly

launched iPhones, the listing on Apple India's website currently shows iPhone

6s, iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone SE. While iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus launched in

India last October, the company launched iPhone SE globally in March this year.

The smartphone was launched in India in April 2016.Incidentally, while the

discontinuation of older models is a first for India, Apple has been following

this practice in the US for past many years. Even though Apple has removed

iPhones older than two-generations from its India website, these models will

likely continue to be available on third-party e-commerce websites and retail

stores in India.Along with the discontinuing the older models, Apple has also

given a storage bump to its last year's iPhone models - iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s

Plus. These models will no longer be available in 16GB and 64GB versions. The

new storage options available in these iPhones are 32GB and 128GB.Apple,

however, has retained the 16GB model in iPhone SE, which will continue to be

available in 16GB and 64GB storage options. As for the all-new iPhone 7 and

iPhone 7 Plus, these will come in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB variants.The new iPhones

will launch in India on October 7 and will have a starting price of Rs 60,000.On

the specifications front, the iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch display with 3D

Touch, whereas the iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch Retina HD display (again, with

3D Touch). Running iOS 10, both smartphones are powered by a new, Apple-designed

quad-core A10 Fusion processor. The company claims that the new CPU is 40%

faster than its predecessor - A9, which powers the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s

Plus.Apple iPhone 7 has a 12MP iSight camera with 6-element lens, f/1.8

aperture, high-speed sensor, 4K video recording and a Quad-LED two-tone flash.

On the other hand, the iPhone 7 Plus has dual 12MP rear cameras (one wide-angle

with f/1.8 aperture and other telephoto with f/2.8 aperture for depth-of-field)

along with Quad-LED flash.Another new feature hitting the iPhone models is water

and dust resistance. Both smartphones have a new Home button which is now

touch-sensitive and uses a new Taptic Engine for better response.
