NEW DELHI: Apple will launch its latest iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in India on

October 16, just three weeks after the flagship phones' US launch, the company

said on Monday. Apple has informed its trade partners and top retailers in the

country that it will undertake a big midnight launch of the new iPhones and

targets to grow sales by 50-60% over what it had sold during last year's launch

phase.



Apple has also asked large retail chains, Apple premium resellers and big local

stores to take prebooking orders for the new iPhones from the first week of

October by when it plans to formalise and announce the price, said three senior

industry officials aware of the company's plans.



"Apple is progressively reducing the time to market of its new iPhones in India

reflecting the importance of the market and to take on rival Samsung which too

had preponed the launch of its latest flagships, Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6

edge+, this year by almost a month," a senior official with a trade partner

said. ET had earlier reported the new iPhones will hit India around October 15.



While Apple is yet to announce the price of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in India, as

per trade estimates the 16GB iPhone 6s will be priced at around Rs 55,000-56,000

and the iPhone 6s Plus 16 GB model will be sold at around Rs 65,000-66,000. The

prices will be much higher for 64 GB and 128 GB models. Apple started selling

the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models in the US on Friday and set a new record by

selling more than 13 million handsets in the first three days. Retailers in

India expect records to break in the country too. Lot Mobiles, which operates

225 stores across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, expects business of around Rs 7

crore on the midnight launch of the new iPhones, 50% more than last year, its

executive director K Krishna Pawan said.



Analysts expect Apple to target iPhone 5 series users in the country, numbering

1.2 million as per Counterpoint Research, but they are divided over how many of

them would go for an upgrade.
