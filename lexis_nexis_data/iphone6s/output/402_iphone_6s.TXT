Apple sells 13 million new iPhones in 3 days



LENGTH: 238  words





Apple sold more than 13 million new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus smartphones in the

first three days of sale, the technology giant has announced.



The figure is a new record for Apple, having previously sold 10 million of the

iPhone 6 and 6 Plus when it went on sale last year. The new 6s model has a

better camera, faster processor and a pressure-sensitive screen for the first

time.



Queues formed outside Apple Stores around the world as the new phones went on

sale on Friday.



The company's chief executive Tim Cook said of the figures: "Sales for iPhone 6s

and iPhone 6s Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any previous first weekend

sales results in Apple's history.



"Customers' feedback is incredible and they are loving 3D Touch and Live Photos,

and we can't wait to bring iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to customers in even

more countries on October 9."



Following the launch of the iPhone 6 last year, Apple went on to see more than

70 million units in three months, and post the largest ever quarterly profit by

a public company in history of £11.8 billion.



There had been suggestions that given the huge sales last year, and the modest

upgrades on the device that demand could drop, however the addition of China as

a launch day country for the first time is likely to have boosted demand once

again.



Apple confirmed the new iPhones will also launch in 40 more countries on October

9, and reach 130 countries by the end of the year.
