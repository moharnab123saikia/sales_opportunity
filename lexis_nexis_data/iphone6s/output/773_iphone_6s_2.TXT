the iPhone 6s;

Excitement for the next version of the iPhone 7 is increasing with each new

"leak" appearing on the internet.



The latest example is a video obtained by French tech site Nowhereelse.fr that

matches up the new iPhone 7 with last year's iPhone 6s flagship.



Dedicated Apple followers will be well aware of the rumours surrounding the next

handset. Supposedly it will have a larger camera lens and a USB Type C

connection at the bottom that will double up as the new headphone slot.

The model obtained in the video appears to closely match these rumours. There's

certainly no 3.5mm headphone port on the base of the handset.



It also has the repositioned antenna on the corners of the handset rather than

across the back.

But in terms of size and design, the alleged iPhone 7 looks very similar to the

existing iPhone 6s .



Many tech fans felt the design change from the iPhone 5s to the iPhone 6 (and

then 6s) was a hugely positive step - praising the thinner body and larger

screen.
