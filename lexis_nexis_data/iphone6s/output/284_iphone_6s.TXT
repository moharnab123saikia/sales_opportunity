It's the moment gadget fans have been waiting for - the new iPhone 6s will

launch on Friday morning and Apple stores in Newcastle's Eldon Square and

Gateshead's Metrocentre are bracing themselves for brisk trade.



Geordie shoppers have been quick off the mark in the past when it comes to new

Apple products, with ex-Newcastle United player Jonas Gutierrez joining the

queue for the launch of the iPad3 back in 2013.



iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be available in gold, silver, space grey and

the new rose gold metallic finish.



iPhone 6s will be available in the UK for a suggested retail price of £539 for

the 16GB model, £619 for the 64GB model and £699 for the 128GB model.



iPhone 6s Plus will be available for a suggested retail price of £619 for the

16GB model, £699 for the 64GB model and £789 for the 128GB model.



But the question is: when can you get your hands on one?



Apple stores in both intu Eldon Square and Metrocentre will open at 8am on

Friday, September 25 to allow customers to get their mitts on the new handsets.



Eldon Square will open its Newgate Street entrance at 6am to allow customers to

queue outside Apple. The store will be open until 8pm on Friday.
