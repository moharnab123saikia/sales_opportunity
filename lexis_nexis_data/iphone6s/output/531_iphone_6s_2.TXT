The gorgeous Galaxy S7 Edge makes the best Android phone that much better.



The fast, powerful, beautiful Galaxy S7 phone is 2016's all-around phone to

beat.



The iPhone 6S Plus has a few key advantages that give it an edge for serious

iPhone users, but its big body still may not fit for a lot of people.



The iPhone 6S offers improved speed everywhere, better front and rear cameras

and a bold new 3D Touch pressure-sensitive display.



Smartphone cameras are becoming evermore skilled and sophisticated - and they

keep getting better. Here are the four best we've seen in recent months.



Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge



Product Review:

http://www.cnet.com/products/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge/#ftag=-CAD187281f



CNET rating: 5 stars out of 5 (Spectacular)



The good: The Galaxy S7 Edge has a gorgeous larger curved screen, has a great

camera and larger battery than the otherwise identical standard S7. It really is

something special. The extra navigation tools can be useful when used

judiciously.



The bad: When you pile on these extra navigation tools, they slow you down

rather than speed you up. It's pricier than other good phones.



The cost: $779.99 to $898.19



The bottom line: The gorgeous Galaxy S7 Edge makes the best Android phone that

much better.



Samsung Galaxy S7



Product Review: http://www.cnet.com/products/samsung-galaxy-s7/#ftag=-CAD187281f



CNET rating: 4.5 stars out of 5 (Outstanding)



The good: Polished design. Awesome camera. Long battery life. microSD storage

slot and water-resistant (again!).



The bad: Annoyingly reflective. Smudge magnet. Plastic-looking selfies even with

no filter. No removable battery, which isn't surprising, but is still a

compromise compared to 2014's S5.



The cost: $669.99 to $759.57



The bottom line: The fast, powerful, beautiful Galaxy S7 phone is 2016's

all-around phone to beat.



Apple iPhone 6S Plus



Product Review: http://www.cnet.com/products/apple-iphone-6s

-plus/#ftag=CAD187281f



CNET rating: 4.5 stars out of 5 (Outstanding)



The good: Improved speed, better cameras, always-on Siri, and pressure-sensitive

3D Touch display compared to last year's 6 Plus.



And it has slightly better battery life, a bigger higher resolution screen, and

optical image stabilization for photos and video that can make a difference.



The bad: It's really big. It costs more than the smaller iPhone. Other

phablet-sized phones offer longer battery life.



The cost: $789.00 to $1159.99



The bottom line: The iPhone 6S Plus has a few key advantages that give it an

edge for serious iPhone users, but its big body still may not fit for a lot of

people.



Apple iPhone 6S



Product Review: http://www.cnet.com/products/apple-iphone-6s/#ftag=-CAD187281f



CNET rating: 4.5 stars out of 5 (Outstanding)



The good: Improved speed everywhere (new processor, faster wireless, quicker

Touch ID sensor); a sturdier body; better front and rear cameras; a bold new 3D

Touch pressure-sensitive display that could end up being a really useful tool in

apps down the road, and which already offers new iOS shortcuts.



The bad: Same battery life as the iPhone 6. The 6S Plus model remains the only

way to get optical image stabilization for photos and video, plus better battery

life. You'll need to pay extra to vault past the too-small storage of the

entry-level 16GB version.



The cost: $449.99 (refurbished) to $889.99



The bottom line: The newest iPhones are top-to-bottom better phones with lots of

enhancements; iPhone 6 owners don't need the upgrade, but everyone else should

seriously consider it.
