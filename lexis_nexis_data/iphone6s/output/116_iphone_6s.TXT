Although the new iPhones have just made their global debut today, that doesn't

stop more enterprising folks from delivering on a huge demand from premium

customers in Mumbai.



The world is going crazy, with the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus releasing

today. People have been queuing up for days, even sending telepresence robots to

book their spot in lines. But India has to wait a little longer before we get

our hands on the devices.



However, there are....other methods to obtain Apple's latest hardware. Our

correspondent Rajesh D'souza tells us that the new iPhones are relatively easy

to grab, in Mumbai at least....for a price. Various large-scale stores in malls

around the city are selling the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in the grey market.

If you just can't wait, and you have money to spare, you can get your hands on

one for a wallet-ripping price.



The iPhone 6s is available at Rs 80,000 for the 16GB version, Rs 1,00,000 for

the 64GB version, and Rs 1,20,000 for the 128GB. The iPhone 6s Plus, meanwhile,

is priced at Rs 1,00,000 for the 16GB variant, Rs 1,20,000 for the 64GB, and Rs

1,40,000 for the 128GB handset. If you'd prefer to wait though, the new iPhones

are expected to be available in India by October 27 at Rs 53,500 for the 16GB

iPhone 6s, and Rs. 62,500 for the 16GB iPhone 6s Plus.
