stop more enterprising folks from delivering on a huge demand from premium
customers in Mumbai.

The world is going crazy, with the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus releasing
today. People have been queuing up for days, even sending telepresence robots to
book their spot in lines. But India has to wait a little longer before we get
our hands on the devices.

However, there are....other methods to obtain Apple's latest hardware. Our
correspondent Rajesh D'souza tells us that the new iPhones are relatively easy
to grab, in Mumbai at least....for a price. Various large-scale stores in malls
around the city are selling the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in the grey market.
If you just can't wait, and you have money to spare, you can get your hands on
one for a wallet-ripping price.

The iPhone 6s is available at Rs 80,000 for the 16GB version, Rs 1,00,000 for
the 64GB version, and Rs 1,20,000 for the 128GB. The iPhone 6s Plus, meanwhile,
is priced at Rs 1,00,000 for the 16GB variant, Rs 1,20,000 for the 64GB, and Rs
1,40,000 for the 128GB handset. If you'd prefer to wait though, the new iPhones
are expected to be available in India by October 27 at Rs 53,500 for the 16GB
iPhone 6s, and Rs. 62,500 for the 16GB iPhone 6s Plus.
