NEW DELHI: Retailers have started taking bookings for Apple's latest iPhones and

those waiting to get their hands on them should be prepared to shell out a

minimum of Rs 62,000 for the lowest storage variant, 16GB, of the iPhone 6S,

going up to Rs 92,000 for the 128GB variant of the iPhone 6S Plus.



According to three trade sources, Apple has communicated the indicative prices

and given the go-ahead to begin taking advance orders. Industry officials told

ET the iPhone 6S 64GB would cost about Rs 72,000 and the 128GB version would be

about Rs 82,000.



The iPhone 6S Plus 16GB would be priced at Rs 72,000 and its larger storage

model of 64GB would be priced at Rs 82,000.



Apple is yet to declare official prices in India, the company said in response

to an emailed query.



Pre-bookings have started at major retail chains across the country. The

MobileStore, India's largest mobile phone retail chain, said it will begin

taking orders from Friday. The Mumbai-based chain with over 800 outlets will

take pre-orders for Rs 2,000 each up to October 13. The devices will become

available on the night of October 15.



"The iPhone 6S 64GB variant is the most popular one as of now," said Satish

Babu, founder of Chennai-based UniverCell Mobiles, one of the largest retail

chains in south India, which has started taking pre-orders across its 300

stores. "Since yesterday we have got at least 100 orders," he added.



Bengaluru-based Sangeetha Mobiles' managing director Subhash Chandra said the

company had started taking pre-orders for Rs 1,000 apiece and expects most

existing iPhone users to upgrade to the new models within the first month.



The retail chains will offer monthly installment payment options, upgrade

programmes and finance schemes. "We will also offer freebies like back case and

accessories during the booking period," Satish Babu added.



Sources add Apple is set to get on a marketing blitzkrieg and retailers are

expecting much higher sales than last year as the Cupertino-based smartphone

maker plans to make adequate stocks available.



"We had asked for 10,000 units for the first week -- that's the kind of response

we're seeing now and expecting it to build after the launch happens. But we may

not get that much," one of the large format retailers told ET, requesting

anonymity.
