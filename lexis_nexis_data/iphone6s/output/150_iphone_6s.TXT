On Wednesday, US wireless carrier T-Mobile announced a new initiative under

which it will sell tech giant Apple's new iPhones -- iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s

Plus -- for $5 per month with trade-in. The new iPhones are set to hit the

markets on September 25.



The new initiative announced by T-Mobile will enable customers to purchase the

iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus smartphones for a monthly payment as low as $5, if

they trade in an 'eligible' smartphone. The deal does not require customers to

make any down payment.



The eligible smartphones which customers can trade in -- to avail a $5-per-month

price for the new iPhones -- include iPhone 6; iPhone 6 Plus; Samsung Galaxy S6;

Galaxy S6 Edge; Galaxy S6 Edge+; and Galaxy Note 5. Any of these handsets can be

traded-in by customers, provided that the handsets are in working and undamaged

condition.



Other than the mentioned handsets which can be traded-in by customers to

purchase the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus at $5 per month, the new promotion

announced by T-Mobile also allows customers to purchase the 16GB iPhone 6s by

paying $10 per month for 18 months if they trade in an iPhone 5s, Samsung Note

4, or Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone.



Furthermore, under the new promotion, customers can also trade-in almost any

other smartphone, and purchase the new iPhones for $15 per month.
