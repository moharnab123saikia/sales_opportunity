predecessors.

Sales for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are on track to beat last year's iPhone 6
and 6 Plus first-weekend sales, which set a company record at 10 million units,
Apple said Monday.

"Customer response to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus has been extremely positive,
and preorders this weekend were very strong around the world," the company said.

The increase in preorders was likely boosted by demand in China, which was
included this year among the countries launching the new devices.

"China demand in particular looks very strong out of the gates and is a positive
sign that the white-hot momentum out of this region shows no signs of abating
despite macro headwinds out of China," Daniel Ives, senior analyst for
technology, media and telecom research at FBR Capital Markets, said in a note.

Apple did not disclose the number of preorders this year, though one analyst
estimated initial weekend sales of up to 13 million units, with 2 million of the
total in the Chinese market.

The tech giant saw its shares jump nearly 2% Monday morning after the
announcement, for a third straight day of gains.

The stock price - down 13% since late July after Apple released a disappointing
quarterly earnings report and China's economy showed signs of slowing down -
closed at $115.31, up 1%.

The upgraded large-screen phones, which were unveiled last week and come with
such new features as 3D Touch, 4K video and Live Photos, will begin shipping
Sept. 25.
