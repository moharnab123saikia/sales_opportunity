NEW DELHI: Here's more on 's upcoming 4-inch iPhone, rumoured to be called

iPhone SE (SE here is said to stand for Special Edition). According to a report

in Apple Insider, iPhone SE's rear camera will support 4K videos. The report

also claimed that Apple is planning to release a promo video that showcases 4K

video shot entirely on the latest iPhone model. The smartphone is tipped to

sport 8MP camera setup of iPhone 6. The company's iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S plus

models, launched last year, also offer support for 4K videos.



Last week, where it is expected to launch the new iPhone. The rumoured

small-screen iPhone is reportedly similar to iPhone 6S in looks, but in a

smaller frame, and is powered by the current flagship's A9 chipset. It will also

support features like Apple Pay and Live Photos but not 3D Touch, which will

remain exclusive to iPhone 6S and 6S Plus for now. KGI Securities analyst

Ming-Chi Kuo, widely considered the most accurate researcher on Apple,

previously said in a note that iPhone SE will be priced at $450. Apple currently

sells the 2.5-year-old iPhone 5S at that price point. He also said that the

price of iPhone 5S will be cut in half after the launch of iPhone SE. The

Apple's March 22 event is also likely to see unveiling of a revamped iPad and

some tweaks to the company's Watch lineup. An earlier Apple Insider report

claimed that Apple may rebrand the upcoming iPad with the iPad Pro moniker

similar to the 12.9-inch model.
