Chennai, July 3 -- Images of Apple's next anticipated smartphone iPhone 6S have

been reportedly leaked to 9to5Mac.com. These images allegedly taken by a from

within the Apple's suppliers show the internal and external view of a sliver

metal casing. The casing looks pretty much similar to the the previous model of

iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in terms of the anodised aluminium, thickness and width.



However, the internal aspect of the casing looks a bit different and looks to

support a new logic board. The rumored DSLR type camera in the phone might just

be low as the camera and LED flash holes in the casing looks the similar to its

predecessor.



According to a leaked email from Vodafone, the phone is expected to hit the

market on September 2015 as iPhone 6S or 6s Plus or even as iPhone 7.
