Apple's September 7 event is drawing closer and judging by the secret message

inside its invitation, the company will probably use this opportunity to launch

the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.



Recently, a few alleged specifications of the smartphones has been leaked online

and it looks very similar to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.



Alleged specifications of the iPhone 7



According to a report from techtastic, the Phone 7 will sport a 4.7-inch screen

with its branded "Retina HD Display" -- 7501334pixel resolution -- and 2GB

LPDDR4 RAM. Both of which are on to the iPhone 6s. It will be powered by a

beefier A10+M10 Processor and a larger 1960mAh battery.



It is also reportedly packing a 12-megapixel camera with 1/2.6-inch sensor,

F/1.9 and 1:3 microns pixels.



Alleged specifications of the iPhone 7 Plus



On the other hand, the iPhone 7 Plus features a 5.5-inch with a 1080x1920

resolution, identical to the iPhone 6s Plus. Powered by an upgraded A10+M10

processor, the smartphone also has 3GB of RAM which is an extra GB compared to

the iPhone 6s.



The smartphone is reported coming with a 2910mAh battery, an upgrade from the

2750mAh on the previous iteration.



The device is supposedly equipped with two 12 megapixel cameras with a 1/3-inch

sensor and F/1.9.
