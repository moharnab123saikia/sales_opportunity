Apple is all set to launch the new iPhone 6S at an event in San Francisco today

but for one marketing firm, this is not good news. Why? The firm is called 6S

and is now worried that with the launch of the iPhone 6S their own brand name is

under threat.



The marketing firm has even put up billboards in New York requesting Apple to

ditch the iPhone 6S and, instead go with the iPhone 7 branding.



In a blog post (http://www.6smarketing.com/blog/weare6s/), Chris Breikss from 6S

Marketing wrote,"See, our company name is 6S Marketing, but our clients,

friends, and colleagues simply refer to us as good ol' "6S." It's a small name

but a big part of our identity - one we've been using since 2000, when we

started this company in my tiny apartment. At that time, we didn't think that

one of the biggest, and most well-respected, companies would use it to name a

mobile device."



He adds that for them 6S is like a fun take on success.



The post ends, "Hopefully, this message will reach you in time and you'll

reconsider leaving "6S" to the originals - we've been rocking it since the

millennium, after all."



The 6S company has been around since 2000 and they feel that with the iPhone 6S,

their 15 year identity is at stake. For now, it looks unlikely though that the

iPhone 6S will be called anything but the iPhone 6S.
