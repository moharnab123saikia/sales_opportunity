Recharging your devices via solar power just got cooler

Over the past few years, I've tried out a several solar-powered recharging

devices, usually in conjunction with summer gift guides or other outdoor gadget

projects. For the most part, the solar chargers were big, bulky things that

required a lot of heavy lifting in order to recharge your much smaller

smartphone, and didn't seem worth the extra effort in lugging it around on your

travels. One exception - the very cool solar-powered flashlights and other

devices that incorporate the hand-crank generator.



p1GoalZero, one of the leaders in the solar power market, has upped its game a

bit. This week at the Outdoor Retailer Expo in Salt Lake City, the company

showed off some new devices aimed at shrinking the size and bulkiness of those

solar panels.GoalZero



The GoalZero Slide Battery lets you take an iPhone 6/6S (or 6 Plus/6S Plus)

inside an OtterBox uniVERSE case and slide in extra battery life.

p1The Slide Battery (announced in May as part of a partnership with OtterBox,

shipping now) works with the OtterBox uniVERSE case (a modular design phone case

that lets you slide the extra battery directly onto the case) and provides extra

battery charge for the iPhone 6/6S ($54.99) and 6 Plus/6S Plus ($59.99). Just

slide the battery onto the case and you get the additional power for your

phone.GoalZero



The Nomad Folio solar recharger can connect to the GoalZero Slide Battery for

extra power for  the iPhone 6/6S and 6 Plus/6S Plus.



p2But even cooler is then connecting it with the Nomad Folio ($39.99 for iPhone

6/6S, $49.99 for 6 Plus / 6SPlus, shipping in Q4 2016) - this smaller solar

panel attaches to the Slide Battery module to provide "endless power" for the

iPhone (as long as the sun is out, one assumes). The Nomad Folio looks a lot

smaller and less bulky than previous solar panel devices aimed at recharging

smartphones and tablets, so I can't wait to try it out.GoalZero



For those times when you need to have the Sun power more than a smartphone (or

recharge it up to 100 times), the GoalZero Yeti 1400 provides lots and lots of

power (you can recharge a TV or refrigerator with its stored energy).



p2The company also launched the new lineup of its Yeti Lithium Solar Power

Stations, for serious solar recharging. The Yeti 400 and Yeti 1400 include

lithium cells and are hardcore solar generators - not only will it recharge your

phone between 30 and 100 times, you can also use it to power a TV or

refrigerator. This generator does come with a cost, however - $699.99 for the

Yeti and $1,999.99 for the Yeti 1400. Those will be available in Q1 2017.



p2But yeah, the sun is awesome, isn't it?
