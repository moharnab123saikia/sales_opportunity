Retailers and telco operators in the UAE are gearing up to sell the new iPhones

- 6S and 6S Plus - from Friday midnight at major malls and outlets.



For the first time, all the retailers in the UAE are getting the supplies

directly from Apple. Normally, it used to be through telco operators.



Nadeem Khanzadah, head of omnichannel retail at Jumbo Group, said they got more

than 500 pre-orders with 100 per cent cash in advance, apart from the loyal

customers where they haven't collected any advance.



Both the retailers as well as the telco operators started accepting pre-orders a

couple of days ago and they will be selling not only to customers who

pre-ordered, but also on over-the-counter sales during the midnight launch.



"We have got enough stocks and the stocks are already with us directly from

Apple," he said.



Retailers say they will open their outlets for midnight launch for about two to

two-and-a-half hours and also bring it to Shopper on Saturday.



"We had discussions with the Dubai World Trade Centre to sell the devices at our

Gitex stands on Friday midnight itself, but due to logistics issues we had

dropped the plan," Khanzadah said.



Neelesh Bhatnagar, CEO of Emax Electronics, said that supply will not be an

issue. Apple has assured us they will provide as much as retailers want.



"Dubai has got full quantity this year unlike like last year," he said.



The phones will also be available in Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi

Arabia on October 10.



"We expect massive demand for the new device, and if the worldwide launch was

any indication, we expect great sales for the new iPhone. The good news is our

initial allocation was very strong so we expect to have good supply to cater to

this," said Omar Abushaban, general manager for Plug Ins.

Apple will be selling the iPhone 6S for Dh2,599 for the 16GB model; Dh2,999 for

the 64GB model; and Dh3,399 for the 128GB model. And it will sell iPhone 6S Plus

for Dh2,999 for the 16GB model; Dh3,399 for the 64GB model; and Dh3,799 for the
