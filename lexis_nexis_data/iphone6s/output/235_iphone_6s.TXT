Now iPhone 6s and 6s Plus users can upload Live Photos on Facebook. One of the

key new features of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus is the ability to take live

photos, it captures about a second and a half of audio and video before and

after you press the shutter. The rear and front facing camera's are both capable

of taking Live Photos



To take a live photo, open the camera app and tap on the Live Photos icon on the

top of the screen, it will turn yellow when activated.



Facebook announced that iOS users who have the latest iPhones will be able to

upload these photos on their Facebook account.



To allow the feature to work, a little 'live' icon will need to be toggled on.

It is the same "bulls eye" shaped icon that needs to toggled on in the camera

app to make your photos come to life with one and a half seconds of audio and

video.



Any iPhone running on iOS 9 or above can view these photos on Facebook, while

Live Photos can only be uploaded by iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus users.



While a few lucky people have this feature early, It is reported to be rolling

out worldwide sometime after new year.
