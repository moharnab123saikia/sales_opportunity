a giant iPad, a revamped smarter Apple TV and two new iPhones that are smarter,
faster and tougher than ever.

Apple executive Tim Cook unveiled the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, the 12-inch iPad
Pro and a revamped Apple TV which, with its own app store, is Apple's push to
grab a slice of the $US34 billion games console market.

In what is likely to be the last Apple event in a year, the company promised to
bring "innovation" to TVs through a TV app store.

The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus look the same on the outside as last year's models,
with a 4.7-inch screen for the 6S and a 5.5-inch screen for the bigger phablet.

But under the hood the new iPhones have significant improvements, including a
tougher aluminium body and glass after some people reported bending their 6 Plus
phones.

The new phones have 3D Touch, which lets you quickly access features of the
phone by applying extra force as you touch the touchscreen, plus a 12 megapixel
camera which is a big jump from the 8 megapixel camera in the iPhone 6.

Selfie fans will appreciate an upgrade to the front-facing camera to 5
megapixels plus the ability to use the glow of the touchscreen as a front flash.

Apple made a push into productivity with an iPad Pro, a 12-inch tablet that lets
you view apps side-by-side in split-screen, that it hopes can revive a stagnant
tablet market.

While Steve Jobs was said to be dismissive of the need for any stylus other than
a finger, Apple launched the Pencil along with a fold-up keyboard giving the
big-screen iPad Pro features to battle the appeal of Microsoft's Surface
tablet.Rod Chester travelled to San Francisco as a guest of Apple.
