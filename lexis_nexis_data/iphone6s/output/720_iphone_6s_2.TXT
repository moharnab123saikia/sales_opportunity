firepower to rival that of phablets. With the 4 inch handset, Apple has made
smaller devices relevant and in more than just one way, and iPhone SE is easily
able to take on its larger sized brother, iPhone 6s. The 4.7 inch handset does
deliver a lot of features, but when you have a choice to make between the two,
there is a lot that you are unaware of and we will help you to make that
decision extremely simple, so let us get started.

1. iPhone SE packs the same hardware as iPhone 6s (if you're looking for
performance)

That is correct; if you are looking for performance from a compact handset, then
look no further than an iPhone SE. It packs the same hardware as an iPhone 6s,
because the insides comprise of Apple's A9 SoC, which features a dual-core 1.84
GHz Twister processor designed by the company itself, along with a PowerVR
GT7600 GPU. In addition, 2GB of LPDDR4 RAM is more than enough to help you
engage in multitasking options. If you are looking for another reason to go for
an iPhone SE despite its smaller screen, you will find that reason posted below.
