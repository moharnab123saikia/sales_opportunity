

HAPPY iPhone launch day y'all.

Today is the day Apple fanatics in their thousands will pour into Apple Stores
and other selected retailers to pick up the latest generation of iPhone - the
6S.

On September 9, Apple announced their 2015 flagship handset will feature the new
3D Touch input and be available in the rose gold colour for the first time.

The much-anticipated 3D touch function measures how deep users press into the
screen, ascribing different functions to each, while live photos capture short
moments of video to make photos spring to life.

Store stock is usually low come launch day, as so many handsets have already
been snapped up by keen aficionados getting in their pre-orders from September
12.

Still, that's not stopped Apple aficionados swamping their favourite stores in
their droves, all hoping to pick up the latest and greatest mobile creation
courtesy of Tim Cook and Cupertino.

There's now a new 13MP iSight camera on the rear, a 5MP selfie cam on the front
and the screen now acts as a super-bright dual-tone flash so those gloomy club
selfies with total strangers will take on a whole new lease of life.

Last week, Apple updated its mobile operating system iOS to the ninth version
and it's available on everything from the latest iPhone 6S and iPad Mini 4 all
the way back to the iPhone 4S.

Will you be getting the iPhone 6S?

Apple WatchOS2 was also released after some nasty bugs were squashed.

In Glasgow, customers were queuing round the corner and round the clock to get
their hands on this year's handset - but will it be worth the wait?

To get in the mood for iPhone launch day, hype yourself up for picking yours up
later or just to laugh at people queuing like sheep in the rain.. check out the
