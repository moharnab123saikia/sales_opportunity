Tech giant Apple said on Monday that the pre-orders for its next-generation

iPhones - iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus - are on track to set a new record,

surpassing the 10 million units which were pre-ordered for the iPhone 6 models

in the first weekend in 2014.



As a result of the Monday disclosure by Apple, that pre-orders for the new

iPhones are apparently set to beat last year's iPhone pre-orders record, the

company's shares witnessed a surge of nearly 2 percent.



The pre-orders for the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus handsets were opened by

Apple on September 12. The shipping of the handsets will commence on September

25.



Though Apple has not disclosed the exact number of new iPhone pre-orders which

it has received till now, analysts had estimated that the pre-order figures will

likely touch 4.5 million units for the first 24 hours. In comparison, 4 million

units of the last-year iPhones were pre-ordered during the first day of the

opening of pre-orders.



Meanwhile, with Apple having revealed that the iPhone 6S Plus model has exceeded

its projections for the pre-order period, Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said in

a statement: "Customer response to iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been

extremely positive, and pre-orders this weekend were very strong around the

world."
