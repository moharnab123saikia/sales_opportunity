Apple remains top brand, but iPhone 6s not so hot

Apple Inc remains the most popular smartphone brand in China, despite its recent

poor performance in its second-largest market, a new report said.



The report, released by China Mobile Communications Corp, is based on the

analysis of the world's largest telecom operator's roughly 800 million

subscribers. This is the first time that China Mobile opened its big data report

to public.



In May, about 15 percent of China Mobile's subscribers are using iPhones, which

amounts to about 120 million users. Domestic brands Xiaomi Corp and Huawei

Technologies Co Ltd rank alongside Samsung Electronics Co as the second-most

popular brands, with each company accounting for 9 percent of subscribers.



When it comes to the fastest-growing handset makers, smaller local rival vivo

Mobile Communication Technology Co Ltd prevailed thanks to its sprawling

offline-retail channels in small cities. About 14 percent of China Mobile

subscribers registered in the first five months of this year are using vivo's

handsets.



James Yan, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research, said

Apple's strong performance in this report is not a contradiction of its recent

declining smartphone sales in China.



"Compared with the iPhone 6 series, which was a record-breaking hit, the iPhone

6S was far less popular, so its sales as a whole declined," Yan said. "But

compared with some local players, the iPhone 6S still delivers a relatively good

performance."



According to Yan, the iPhone 6S had a strong start in the first several months

of this year, but the demand quickly died out once the replacement cycle was

finished, given that iPhone 6S only has incremental improvements to iPhone 6.



Still, Apple is the brand with the highest consumer loyalty in China. Forty-five

percent of Apple users choose to buy another iPhone when they replace their old

handsets, far higher than the average of 18 percent among other brands.
