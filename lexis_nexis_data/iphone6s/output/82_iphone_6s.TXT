The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are available now, and we've got a breakdown of the

best deals that the networks are offering right now.



The new handsets were released in the UK just weeks ago and if you want to get

your hands on one now, or in time for Christmas, you'll want to find the best

deal.



For the handsets alone, without a fixed monthly contract, prices for the iPhone

6s start from £539 and £619 for the 6s Plus.



Pricey! But with networks including O2, EE, Three and Vodafone offering various

deals for 24-month contracts, a new shiny handset could be yours sooner than you

think.



For the iPhone 6s, the cheapest pay monthly tariff is with Three and is over 24

months.



You'll pay £38 per month and an initial £99 upfront for a 16GB handset, with the

plan including 1GB of data and unlimited calls and texts.



For the iPhone 6s Plus, the cheapest pay monthly tariff is with Vodafone and is

over 24 months.



You'll pay £41 per month and an initial £169 upfront cost for a 16GB handset.

The plan includes 500 minutes, unlimited texts and 500MB of data.



If you would rather pay less upfront and more per month, then the network with

the lowest upfront cost for an iPhone 6s is Vodafone .



You can pay just £9 upfront and £54 per month over 24 months for the 16GB

handset, unlimited minutes and texts and 10GB data.



The network with the lowest upfront cost the iPhone 6s Plus is also Vodafone for

just £9, but you'll pay £64 per month for 24 months.

O2 is the network with the second lowest upfront cost. You'll pay an initial fee

of £9.99 and then £59 per month for 24 months. This plan includes 20GB data and

unlimited calls and texts.

all the networks and plans available:
