moment in motion.



   Live Photos, 3D Touch and other advancements in the new iPhones are powered

RESULT DECLARATION DATE / OTHER EVENTS



   Limassol, Cyprus, May 7th, 2015 - ASBISc Enterprises Plc, a leading

distributor of IT products in the emerging markets of Europe, the Middle East

and Africa, has announced its results for Q1 2015.



   Revenues decreased by 17.69% to USD 281.8m, from USD 342.4m in Q1 2014,

mostly due to lower market demand in many geographies and strong competition on

the own brands business. Gross profit decreased to USD 6.9m, from USD 22.2m in

Q1 2014, due to lower revenues and one-off events: clearing of inventories at

lower prices and warranty losses.



   The company continued to reduce its expenses, cutting admin, selling and

financial costs by 29.64%, 12.60% and 37.59% respectively. This was not enough

however to fully offset the decrease in gross profit. As a result, in Q1 2015

the company generated a net loss after taxation of USD 12.4m, in comparison to a

net loss after taxation of USD 3.4m in Q1 2014.



   Although continuation of unfavourable market conditions in the Former Soviet

Union is expected for the rest of this year, the company observes improvement in

other regions, and expects revenues and gross profit to start growing from Q2

2015 and the overall results to further improve in the second half of the year,

as was the case in 2014.



   Siarhei Kostevitch, CEO and Chairman of ASBISc Enterprises Plc, commented:

"We were prepared for a much better quarter in terms of sales. However, due to

market weakness, a lot of customers postponed new orders while they were

flushing out old stocks. This resulted in lower sales and a lower gross profit.

Sales at lower prices also contributed to this decrease. Our results have been

also affected by warranty losses."



   Kostevitch continued: "The inventory sell-out and warranty losses cost us

about USD 7.1m. While we expect the F.S.U. market to remain weak this year, we

have changed our inventory plans, taken actions to resolve warranty claims, and

revised our credit risk policy. As a result, we do not expect all these factors

that affected our Q1 2015 results to happen again in the future. Our revenues

and gross profit margin are expected to start growing from Q2 2015, with

significant improvement expected to be delivered in the second half of the

year."
