Both iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus came with 128GB as their maximum internal

storage and it looks like iPhone 7 is going to sport 256GB of internal memory

thanks to the latest news that we just covered not long ago.



Samsung, one of the industry's leading memory chip manufacturers announced that

it will start to mass produce 256GB UFS 2.0 memory chips for next-gen

smartphones. When we hear the term next-gen, it is obvious that the only devices

that can surpass iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, is iPhone 7 and of course its

larger brother, iPhone 7 Plus.



This will definitely be seen as a very smart move on Apple's part, seeing as how

the globe is transitioning to carrying a ton of content in their mobile devices

for later viewing, not to mention that 4K content does not exactly go gentle on

your storage. However, while we say this, what is going to happen to the

previous storage models? Are 16GB models going to be cut out of the equation

completely, or is there still room for their existence.



If you ask us, 16GB is already too low to be present in advanced mobile

computing products and since the OS and file system each a small chunk of it,

you have to work around with that limitation.



While 16GB might be completely fine for a small percentage of consumers, a

flagship phone with such minuscule amount of internal memory should definitely

be considered a joke. While we wait in anticipation of iPhone 7 Plus, what about

its 4.7 inch sized iPhone 7? Will it feature the same maximum internal storage

capacity or does Apple have different plans for it.



Due to the sheer size differences, not to mention Apple's affinity in keeping

its mobile products as thin as possible, we should expect the battery capacity

of iPhone 7 Plus to be considerably larger than iPhone 7, but we will definitely

keep you in the loop of what is to come in the foreseeable future.



For now, we definitely cannot wait to see how the larger of the upcoming iPhones

is going to perform. We have also reviewed Apple's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus

to see how well they fare in our tests, so be sure to check those out while you

are reading this.



2016 is definitely going to be another great year for Apple fans.
