Apple rolled out a holiday shopping list of new devices Wednesday, with its

newest iPhones only part of a lineup that included a new Apple TV and iPad Pro.



"We could not be more excited to be here this morning," Apple CEO Tim Cook said

as he opened the event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. "It

has been an incredible year for Apple. We are really firing on all cylinders."



The Apple TV with a new remote that doubles as a game controller makes Apple a

contender in the gaming market, where it will square off against traditional

consoles that cost much more. It also marks the debut of a TV app store.



"For me, the most interesting and intriguing part is Apple TV and what that's

going to mean for entertainment," said Chris Hobbs, president and cofounder of

the software development company Two Tall Totems and president of the Vancouver

iOS Developers Meet Up Group. "All of a sudden, now (Apple TV is) not just for

consuming entertainment, it's actually going to be a full game machine so, we're

going to be able to play games just like we could on the phone.



"It could be a game changer because all of a sudden all those apps we had

written for the iPad and the iPhone are now transferable right onto the Apple

TV." Aaron Hilton, executive chair of the mobile app development company Conquer

Mobile, said with Wednesday's announcement Apple is leveraging the strengths of

its existing ecosystem and bringing them to the home entertainment market.



"It's great news for developers, especially game developers looking to target

this audience," he said. "You can write your code for iPhone first and also make

an Apple TV variant and know you are going to have a decent market pretty

quickly."



The iPad Pro, a powerful 12.9-inch iPad with an optional keyboard and a new

Apple Pencil stylus, is clearly aimed at the enterprise market Microsoft has

been targeting with its Surface lineup and Windows 10. (Microsoft was among

companies on stage at the Apple event, demonstrating Microsoft Office on the new

iPad.)



The iPad Pro has the power to handle demanding applications, and the Apple

Pencil allows for unprecedented accuracy for drawing and sketching. The iPad Pro

is slim at 6.9 millimetres and lightweight at 712 grams (1.57 pounds), with a

full-sized screen keyboard as well as an optional physical keyboard. It has an

eight-megapixel iSight camera and 1080p video recording. No Canadian pricing has

been announced for the device, but it starts at $799 US for the 32-gigabyte

Wi-Fi model, with the Apple Pencil $99 US and the smart keyboard $169 US. The

128GB cellular-plus Wi-Fi model will be $1,079 US.



The new Apple TV adds Siri voice control plus the new remote that doubles as a

game controller. Canadian pricing is not yet available, according to Apple

Canada, but the Apple TV 32GB model will be $149 US, with the 64GB model $199

US.



In overall appearance, there is little change with the newest iPhones, although

features have been upgraded. The iPhone 6S has the same 4.7-inch screen size as

the iPhone 6, and the 6S Plus is 5.5 inches, the same as the 6 Plus.



New to the iPhones is 3D Touch, a pressure-sensitive technology demonstrated in

such features as new "Peek and Pop" that reacts to a light touch with a peek at

a photo, webpage or other content, while more pressure will pop right into the

content. The iPhones also have Live Photo, a new feature that adds sound and

action to photos by capturing time both at the beginning and end of your photo

shot.



The new iPhones deliver 4K video, a first for an iPhone, a 12-megapixel

rear-facing camera, up from the 8 megapixels of the 6 and 6 Plus, with a

fivemegapixel HD camera and a new screen flash for low-light selfies.



Pre-orders start for the iPhones Saturday, with the phones available starting

Sept. 25.
