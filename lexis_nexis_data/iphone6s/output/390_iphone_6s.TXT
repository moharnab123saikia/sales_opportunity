NEW DELHI: Apple's new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are now officially available

in India.



Interestingly, this is the fastest iPhone rollout in India with the phones being

made available less than a month after being going on sale in the US.



We've been using the two new iPhones for the last few days and will soon have

our detailed reviews out. Meanwhile, you can watch our unboxing videos of the

two phones.
