Old models challenge iPhone 6s in China



LENGTH: 263  words





Despite Chinese customers' insatiable hunger for the new Apple  smartphone

models, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus still face  challenges, with the

biggest likely from old models.



A research  note shows the previous models, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, enjoyed

stellar sales before the new handsets were released in September, which  may

encroach the market expansion of new models, Xinhua news agency  reported.



The two previous recent models were the best-selling  smartphones in China from

June till August, according to a report of the  UK-based market research company

Kantar Worldpanel.



"Buyers  mentioned clarity and resolution, camera quality and screen size as the

three most important purchase drivers," said Tamsin Timpson, strategic  insight

director of the company's Asia branch.



In the three-month circle, smartphone sales represented 84 percent of overall

phone sales in China.



The  report did not reveal what is behind the favour for the last models,  but

it is a common phenomenon that some Chinese consumers, especially  iPhone

buyers, are inclined to choose the older version with favourable  prices ahead

of new product release.



So far, the new models have performed well in the Chinese market, the world's

second largest after the US.



Apple sold around three million iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in the week after

the launch, according to media reports.



In  the US, however, market share for Apple iOS between June and August was  at

its lowest point since August 2014, as customers waited for the new  products to

become available in September, the report showed.
