After months of speculation and rumors, Apple has finally unveiled its next

iPhone models. Called the 6S and 6S Plus, the newer iPhones are a progression to

the iPhone 6 and 6S that Apple announced on the same day last year.



As expected the newer iPhones will look exactly the same as its predecessors but

will come with enhanced hardware, 3D touch and bumped up camera and battery

capabilities. As Apple's event tagline- "Hey Siri, give us a hint" suggested-

the new iPhones come with enhanced capabilities for Apple's voice assistant

Siri. That basically means Siri will be able to give you information from more

data sources and will offer more integration with apps such as photos.



Apple has also played catch up when it comes to hardware.The new iPhones come

with quad core processor and 2GB RAM. The 4.7 inch, LED backlit, HD display, 6s

will come with Apple's A9 tri-core 1.5GHz processor paired with 2GB of RAM.

Apple claims its new chip is 70% faster than its predecessor. Despite the rumors

of Apple reviving the 32GB version, the new iPhones will retain the 16BG, 64GB

and 128Gb versions.



The 6s Plus which flaunts a 5.5-inch LED-backlit full HD display running at a

resolution of 1080x1920 pixels will run the same processor and come in same

memory variants.



Apple has also given the cameras on its iPhones a facelift. Both the 6s and 6s

Plus will sport a 12MP rear camera with 4k video capabilities and a 5MP front

camera which will support 1080p video recording.



There is no word about Indian pricing yet, though the iPhone 6s US pricing

starts at $199 for 16GB, $299 for 64 GB and $399 for the 128GB variant on a two

year contract. The price for unlocked iPhone 6s is the same as the previous

version and starts from $650 for the 16GB version.



The iPhone 6s Plus US pricing starts at $299 for 16GB variant and goes all the

way up to $499 for the 128GB variant on a two year contract. The price for

unlocked iPhone 6s Plus starts from $749 for 16GB.



Apple has however made little progress on the battery front. The 6s features an

1810mAh non-removable Li-Po battery while the 6s Plus comes with 2915mAh

battery. On the software front it comes shipped with Apple's iOS 9 out-of-the

box.



Apple has also included 3D Touch feature in both its new iPhones. The feature

that recognizeds three types of touch was first introduced with the new MacBook

and MacBook Pro. It is being touted as the most innovative feature of the iPhone

.



The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be available in four color options - Space Grey,

Silver, Gold and Rose Gold. Rose gold is the latest addition to Apple's color

scheme this year. New iPhones will be available from September 25 in select

geographies. However, they are expected to be available in India by the end of

this year.
