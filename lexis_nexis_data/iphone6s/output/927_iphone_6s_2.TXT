NEW DELHI: For those waiting to get their hands on the latest iPhone, here's

some news... Pre-bookings have begun at major retail chains across the country.



The MobileStore, India's largest mobile phone retail chain said Thursday that it

will begin pre-bookings from Friday, October 2 and will offer consumers EMI

options among other freebies. Another retail chain rival UniverCell said it

started pre-bookings already and has managed to get a minimum of 100 orders

within day.



Mumbai-based The Mobile Store has over 800 outlets across India which will begin

taking pre-orders for Rs 2,000 each, which will end by October 13, a couple of

days before the phones become available for purchase on intervening night of

October 15 and 16.



Chennai-based UniverCell Mobiles will go the extra mile of offering an upgrade

program to existing customers besides offering finance schemes and EMI offers to

new customers.



"The iPhone 6s 64 GB variant is the most popular one as of now," said Satish

Babu, founder of UniverCell Mobiles. "We will also offer freebies like back case

and accessories during booking period," he added.



According to retail trade sources, the price of a 16 GB variant of iPhone 6s is

said to be around Rs 62,000 and the iPhone 6s Plus with the same storage would

cost Rs 72,000.
