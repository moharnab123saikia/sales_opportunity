Complete specifications list of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus listed here



LENGTH: 503  words





If you're confused about the specifications of both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus,

we have made things so much easier for you with these spec differences



For iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, it's important that you know the hardware

specifications of both smartphones so that you can judge your buying decision

based on the information that you see in the table below. Remember that iPhone

6s and iPhone 6s Plus were waterproof, but did not receive any form of

certification. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus on the other hand are IP67 certified.

What this means is that they will easily be able to withstand dust and a few

splashes of water, but that does not mean that you should dive into a pool while

you're gripping the phone.



These phones are not IP68 certified, so chances are that they will not survive

your little dive. Apple has retained the same screen size and resolution for its

iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but the company does state that the battery life has

significantly improved. It is because of the improved and efficient hardware, or

larger battery capacities, we cannot really tell at this point. Hopefully when

teardown experts get their hands on both smartphones, we'll get to know more

about these marvelous handsets.



Both phones do not come with a 3.5mm headphone jack and while that is a shame to

see, Apple has included its Lightning-based EarPods, along with a

Lightning-to-headphone adapter so you can plug in your earphones and headphones

too. Apple's iPhone 7 Plus is slightly more expensive than iPhone 6s Plus, but

it comes with more storage, so that's a win-win situation for you at least.
