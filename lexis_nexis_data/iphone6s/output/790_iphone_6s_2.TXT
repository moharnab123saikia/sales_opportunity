Sept. 25--The Avon and Plainfield Verizon stores opened early last Friday

morning for the release of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.



Among the patrons waiting to get the new phone were Ben Davis High School junior

Jaylyn Robinson and his siblings, James Oliver and Zaniyah Burney.



Robinson said he was hoping to upgrade from the iPhone 5s to the iPhone 6s.



"I'm most excited about the 3D touch feature," he said.



The iPhone 6s introduces 3D touch, which allows your phone to sense how much

pressure is applied to the screen.



With a security officer on hand and more than 11 employees ready to assist

customers, Verizon was prepared for a big crowd coming in to get the new phone.



"If you're switching from Android to iPhone, we now have an app that makes it

easier to switch over," Verizon employee Kyle Graham said.



While other iPhone releases reporting customers camping out in front of the

Verizon stores, some for a week ahead of the planned release, only Robinson and

his siblings arrived 30 minutes before the store's scheduled early opening here.
