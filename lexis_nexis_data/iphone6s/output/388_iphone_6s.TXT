Those waiting for Apple's latest phones from overseas via the grey market route

may not get them. And those planning to bring them from outside India without

paying duty might need to do a rethink as they could be fined.Smugglers of the

newest iPhones may even face arrest.



Noticing a massive spurt in smuggled iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models through

Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai customs authorities have

issued a press release informing fliers to "voluntarily declareiPhones to

customs on arrival."



They warned that passengers picked up after passing through the green channel

will be liable to pay a fine, penalty and customs duty . According to the

release, duty will be levied even on a single phone since the value of the

device exceeds the 'free allowance.' Passengers carrying iPhones in commercial

quantity are liable to be arrested.



Additional Commissioner of Customs, Mumbai Airport, Milind Lanjewar confirmed

the developments to ET and said the rules already exist and are being reiterated

to travelers."For goods above ' . 45,000, technically passengers have to de



clare but most people are not aware of it. A duty of 36% is levied on the amount

above this limit," he said. Even if a single iPhone brought from overseas

exceeds the free allowance value, it would have to be declared and duty would

have to be paid.



The cheapest iPhone 6s, which comes with storage of 16GB, is listed on Apple's

website as costing $649 (. '42,350) while the same model on its



Singapore website can be purchased for S$1,048 (. '48,000).



When value of undeclared goods rises above ' . 20 lakh, the authorities proceed

with arrests, Lanjewar added. The Mumbai Airport Customs authorities have seized

about 200 of the latest iPhone models valued at '. 1.23 crore over the past two

weeks. The phones were brought into India by fliers coming from Singapore, Hong

Kong, London, Dubai and other countries. Authorities have since increased

screening of checked-in and hand baggage, besides profiling passengers.



ET reported last week, citing trade sources, that the iPhone 6s 16 GB would be

sold for ' . 62,000, 64 GB variant for ' . 72,000 and 128 GB version for ' .

82,000, while the iPhone 6s Plus 16 GB would be priced at ' . 72,000, 64 GB at '

. 82,000 and 128 GB at . 92,000. "As the models are still ' to be launched in

India, passengers are trying to smuggle these iPhones for monetary benefit by

sale through grey market," the authorities have said.



The Mumbai seizure was not the only one. On Sunday , seven youth were detained

at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport with about 182 iPhone 6s and

6s Plus models brought in from Hong Kong and Singapore on separate flights,

officials said. With the launch 10 days away , they expect more such cases.
