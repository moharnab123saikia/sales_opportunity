A new iPhone 6s bug has been found that lets anyone access your photos and

contacts. Here's how to stop it.



Multiple users of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are reporting a new Siri bug that

has the potential to let anyone access pictures and stored contacts on the phone

even when it is locked.



What is the bug?



The bug is similar to other flaws in the iOS that have been

4022959| exploited in the past.}



The hacker asks Siri to find tweets including an email address. Once a suitable

tweet is found, the iPhone's 3D Touch can be used to add that address to a

contact - a process that opens up the entire address book.



When selecting a contact to add the email address to, the user can choose any of

the stored contacts on the iPhone, revealing their phone numbers, email or

addresses. And by selecting an option to edit a contact's profile photo, they

can access the entire photo library.

be overly worried as the odds of getting hacked are very slim.



Am I at risk?



The bypass only works on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, because those devices

feature 3D Touch, which is used for this particular variant of the passcode

bypass trick.



So if you don't have either of these models you have nothing to worry about.



You can check if your phone is susceptible to the passcode bypass by following

the steps in the video above.

How can I protect my phone?



Turn off Siri's access to your phone when it is locked.



Apple eggheads will likely be working on solution to this bug, but for now the

only way to prevent it is to disable Siri functions.  Go to Settings, then

Privacy, then select Photos and deselect Siri.
