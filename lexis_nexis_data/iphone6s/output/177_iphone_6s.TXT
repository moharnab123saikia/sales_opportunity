In a big move to attract customers, Apple has introduced buyback scheme on the

iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus starting with discounts between Rs 9,000 and Rs

25,000 on a range of select models including its own, and those from Samsung,

Sony, HTC, Lumia and Google Nexus.



Beginning Valentine's Day weekend to March 26, the latest iPhones may be

available from the starting range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 for the 16 GB iPhone

6s variant after discount, depending on the model exchanged by a consumer. At

present, the lowest variant of iPhone 6s is estimated to be available for under

Rs 52,000 offline and under Rs 45,000 at online sites.



The offer will be available in 'participating merchant outlets' (read: offline

retail outlets), as per conditions mentioned on the Indiaishop.in website,

backed by Apple's official online reseller Infibeam.com.



"Apple is giving greater flexibility to distributors and retailers," said Tarun

Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint. "They are estimating sales to be slow

and therefore want to make use of these schemes to get sales going," he added,

indicating that more such offers may be in store going forward.



Apple has had a dream run in India last year, selling more than 2 million

iPhones of which 800,000 in the October to December quarter alone - it's best

ever - where it clocked revenue growth of 38%, much faster than core markets of

the US and China.



On a granular level though, Apple sales lost steam in the latter half of October

to December quarter, which may have triggered the new offers for the latest

models, which were launched in September last year.



iPhone 6s entry level model with 16 GB storage was launched at a very high price

of Rs 62,000, while 64 GB and 128 GB models were launched at Rs 72,000 and Rs

82,000, respectively. The iPhone 6s Plus variants ranged between Rs 72,000 and

Rs 92,000.



Apple has been making aggressive price cuts on older devices such as iPhone 5s

and even cut prices on iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models after consumers were

deterred by the high cost of new models, besides increasing availability of

models. The latest models are also available on EMI schemes.



The Cupertino-based company is making concentrated efforts to expand its

presence in the market. It has also put in application to set up its iconic

stores in the country. India's hyper growth last quarter was also recognized by

CEO Tim Cook in the latest earnings last month, "During hard times like now, it

provides an opportunity to invest in newer markets such as India where there are

long-term prospects," he said.



Apple not only sees the potential of new users but also a huge replacement

market, starting with the existing Apple install base of more than 5 million.

"Half of these Apple users have come on board in the last 18 months,"

Counterpoint's Pathak added.
