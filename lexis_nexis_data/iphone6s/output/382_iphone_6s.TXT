APPLE claims demand for its new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus could surpass the

record-breaking sales of iPhone 6 last year, as the newest versions of the

firm's smartphones go on-sale.



The new iPhone 6s, which was unveiled earlier this month, has much the same

design, but comes with an improved camera in both the front and rear of the

phone, as well as a pressure sensitive screen - where users can press more

firmly in order to open new shortcuts - a feature Apple calls 3D Touch.



The technology giant said that pre-orders were "on pace" to match those of the

iPhone 6 launch in September last year, when that device went on to sell more

than 10 million units in the first three days, and help Apple post world-record

profits.



The new phone also comes with a rose gold finish on the rear casing for the

first time.



Phil Schiller, Apple's head of worldwide marketing said: "Customer response to

the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been incredibly positive, we can't wait to

get our most advanced iPhones ever into customers' hands starting this Friday.



"iOS 9 is also off to an amazing start, on pace to be downloaded by more users

than any other software release in Apple's history."
