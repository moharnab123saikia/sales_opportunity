Apple's muchawaited iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will cost '. 62,000 for the

lowest storage variant and as much as '. 92,000 for the top-end model,

distributors said Thursday. The India prices are much higher than those in

overseas markets such as the US and Singapore, which may deter buyers,

especially those intending to upgrade from iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, experts

said.



The latest phones, which have been offered for astronomical prices on websites

such as eBay India, Quikr, Olx and Flipkart since the US launch on September 25,

will be available for pre-registration at Apple's local distributor websites,

includ



ing Brightstar, besides online portals Paytm and Snapdeal.



The 16 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB variants of the iPhone 6s will be sold for ' .

62,000, '. 72,000 and . 82,000, respectively ' , and similar versions of the 6s

Plus will cost ' . 82,000 and ' . 72,000, ' . 92,000.In the US, the cheapest

iPhone 6s is listed on Apple's website for $649 (.'42,235) while the same model

on its Singapore website can be purchased for S$1,048 '8,295). ET was the first

to re(.port the prices last week, which have now been confirmed. The new models

in India are 14-16% more expensive than the devices launched last year.



"Globally, pricing remained similar to last year's models, but a strong dollar

led to increase in pricing in certain regions this year...India, not being a

high-volume country for Apple, the increase in pricing might be a result of weak

rupee and rise in duty compared to last year," said Tarun Pathak, a senior

analyst at Counterpoint Technology Market Research.
