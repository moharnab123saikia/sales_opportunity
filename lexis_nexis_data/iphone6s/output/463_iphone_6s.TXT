iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take a long time to charge because of standard

bundled chargers



LENGTH: 318  words





Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus despite being better in every manner, lag behind

when you plug them in the wall socket in comparison to other phones



New 12MP cameras, with better performing A10 chips and still Apple couldn't

figure out to reduce the total charging time on its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

That's because just like its predecessors, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, Apple

has continued to ship its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with 5W chargers, so you

can imagine how long it would take for these smartphones to get charged

completely.



In fact, according to a detailed review done by Anandtech for the iPhone 7 and 7

Plus, both iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus are able to charge faster than Apple's

latest mobile products, but that is also because they feature smaller battery

capacities than their successors. The disappointing thing about these tests is

that devices like Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, which feature larger batteries

than iPhone 7 Plus are able to charge much faster, but that is thanks to

improved charging technology.



This does not mean that you continue to use the 5W charger that comes bundled

with your iPhone. You can also resort to using the iPad charger or another

aftermarket charger, but before you do, make sure that its charging

specifications are in line with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus' requirements.

According to the test results, we have included a total of six different phones

as well as the amount of time it takes for their batteries to go from 0-100

percent.



Galaxy S7 (Snapdragon 820 version): 1.51 hours

Galaxy S7 edge (Snapdragon version): 1.85 hours

iPhone 6s: 1.94 hours

iPhone 6s Plus: 2.80 hours

iPhone 7: 2.08 hours

iPhone 7 Plus: 3.07 hours



Hopefully, with the announcement of iPhone 8, Apple will realize to ship out a

more powerful charger. With these devices coming without a headphone jack, it is

becoming necessary to improve charging technologies.
