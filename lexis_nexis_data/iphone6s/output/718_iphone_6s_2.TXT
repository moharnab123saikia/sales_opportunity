Investors may have turned their noses up at the new products Apple launched last

week, but it seems consumers certainly haven't.



The tech giant is predicting that sales of the latest version of its flagship

iPhone - the 6S and 6S Plus - will hit a record when they start shipping next

week.



The company said it is likely that more than 10 million units will be snapped up

in their first weekend, beating the record set last year by predecessors the

iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.



Unlike previous iPhones' opening weekends, Chinese customers will be able to buy

the device, which has a better camera and faster operating system, at the same

time as those elsewhere, a factor that should provide an extra sales boost.



Apple starting taking preorders for the smartphones on Saturday and will begin

sending them out to customers on September 25.



The iPhone 6S Plus has so far proven particularly popular and it said it is

working to catch up with demand.



"Preorders this weekend were very strong around the world," Apple spokeswoman

Trudy Muller said in a statement.



Apple also unveiled a new version of its iPad, the iPad Pro, a revamped Apple TV

and other devices at its special event in San Francisco last week.



Shares fell around 2% after the announcement as analysts questioned Apple's

ability to continue innovating.
