iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus -- on Saturday morning. Interested customers will
be able to preorder the new iPhones from 3:01 a.m. ET / 12:01 a.m. PT onwards on
Saturday, September 12.

The shipping of the new iPhones will commence on September 25.

Customers who want to get a head start in preordering the new iPhone 6s and
iPhone 6s Plus handsets can begin the preorder process early by visiting the
Apple website or through the Apple Store app on their handsets.

To start the new iPhone early preordering process via the Apple Store app on
their existing iPhones, customers have to select 'Get ready to pre-order iPhone
6,' and then select the 'Remember me' option to enable the app to save their
wireless account details, including their phone number, ZIP code, and the last
four digits of their social security number. The app finally allows customers to
know the iPhone pricing available to them.

Without a contract, the cost of the 16GB version of iPhone 6s is $649. However,
with a contract, the cost of the iPhone 6s model begins at $199 for the 16GB
version; while the 16GB variant of the iPhone 6s Plus is priced at $299. In
addition, Apple is - for the first time - also offering a lease option for
customers who want to switch their handsets, but do not have the cash to do so.
