FreedomPop on Tuesday announced its plan to lure iPhone 6S (and iPhone 6) users
with a free wireless service just for them.

Jumping at the opportunity to attract customers whose networks don't come tied
to specific carrier networks, FreedomPop is offering iPhone customers free
serviceÂ of 500 MBs of data, 500 texts and 200 voice minutes per month. What's
more, customers will get an additional 5GBs of data on activation and free
international calling to over 62 countries. FreedomPop says this plan is heavier
on data than past offerings.

For iPhone users who will blow through that deal, FreedomPop will offer an
iPhone plan with unlimited talk and text, plus 1GB of data for $19 per month,
with the first month free.

FreedomPop also will begin selling financed iPhone 6S devices in October.

The LA-based service provider, which has pulled in about $60M in funding and has
based its service on Sprint's underlying network, is also expanding beyond the
United States with free service into the United Kingdom. The service provider
plans to stretch into seven other countries over the next 12 months.
