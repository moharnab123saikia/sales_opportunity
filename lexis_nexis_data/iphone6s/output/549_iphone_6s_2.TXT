

After brick-andmortar retailers, it's now the turn of India's e-tailing giants
to gear up for Apple's 6S and 6S Plus launch, which is slated to rake in
domestic revenues in excess of Rs 6,000 crore for the US tech company . Apple
plans to sell more than 10 lakh units of its new phone in India, and half of it
is expected to happen through the online route. This will also reduce the
chances of offline retailers charging a scarcity premium, say industry experts.

The new phones will hit

shelves on October 16 at a price ranging between Rs 62,000 for the 16GB iPhone
6S and Rs 92,000 for the 128GB iPhone 6S Plus. While offline retailers ha

ve already started taking bookings for the launch, their online counterparts
have readied a war chest that includes delivery on launch day , cashbacks,
assured buybacks and great trade-in values.

For instance, Snapdeal, one of Apple's largest partners here, is bundling an
interesting assured buyback offer with the iPhone 6S. "Within six months of
purchase, if you want to sell your phone we will pay you 50% of its value and
40% after that, till 15 months," said Karan Khara, VP , strategic alliances,
Snapdeal.
