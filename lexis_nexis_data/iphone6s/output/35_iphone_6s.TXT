Apple will launch the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus in selected countries on

Friday, including the US, the UK, France, and Germany. Israel is not included in

the first launch wave, but it has been learned that the device will reach Israel

very soon - in late October-early November, according to reports.



iPhones are sold officially in Israel through a number of importers, including

the major cellular operators (Partner Communications Ltd. (Nasdaq: PTNR; TASE:

PTNR), Cellcom Israel Ltd. (NYSE:CEL; TASE:CEL), and Pelephone Communications

Ltd.), and also through importer C-Data.



The price of an iPhone 6S in the US will be NIS 2,700 (including local taxes),

while the price of an iPhone 6S Plus will be NIS 3,130.



A year ago, the price of an iPhone 6 at its launch in Israel was NIS 3,700,

while the iPhone 6 Plus was sold for NIS 4,200. The current price of an iPhone 6

is NIS 3,500, and the iPhone 6 Plus is going for NIS 3,900.



What is new about the new iPhones



The new iPhones appear exactly the same as their predecessors, but they are made

out of a newer and tougher aluminum, with the same size screen and new protected

glass. The significant innovation in the iPHone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus is a

touch screen technology called 3D Touch.



3D Touch technology identifies the force of the finger touching the screen and

provides new gestures. For example, when you touch the headline of an e-mail

message, you get a quick glimpse of the body of the message. Apps like Instagram

and Facebook will support the technology, and in the case of Facebook, status

can be raised directly from the home page on the iPhone by touching the icon and

opening an additional menu.



The new iPhones include the same screens: 4.7-inch with 750 x 1334 pixels

resolution for the iPhone 6S and 5.5-inch with 1080 x 1920 pixels resolution for

the iPhone 6S Plus. The iPhones come with an A9 processor on a 64-bit platform.

The A9 includes the movement processor that was formerly a separate processor

inside the smartphone.
