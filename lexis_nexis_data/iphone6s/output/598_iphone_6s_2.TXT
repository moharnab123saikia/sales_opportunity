India. And, we all know that the smartphones will be coming with price tags
ranging from Rs 62,000 to Rs 92,000.

However, it is important to note that these price listings as found in
e-commerce sites such as Flipkart and InfiBeam, are believed to be more higher
than the price of the smartphone in the US.

While we know that the iPhone 6s 16 GB variant is priced at Rs 62,000 in India,
the same variant comes with a price tag of $649. If you convert it to Indian
Rupees, then its Rs 42,235. Also, the same model has been listed at S$1,048 in
Singapore which is approx Rs 48,295 in India.

According to The Economic Times, the new iPhones are 14 - 16 percent more
expensive in India than the iPhones that were launched last year.

Also, according to a source mentioned in The Economic Times, the increase in the
pricing in India might be a result of weak Indian Rupees and the duty charges
that have been raised when compared to the last year.

However, with the launch of the new iPhone models in India nearing and people
being able to pre-order the smartphones on InfiBeam, we just have to wait and
watch as to how would the Indian iPhone aspirants take this pricing.
