Sales of the latest iPhone are "on pace" to break last year's record of ten

million, Apple said yesterday. Advance orders for the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S

Plus were "very strong around the world", the company said. Sales of the new

handsets, to be released on September 25, will be boosted by China, which was

not included in the launch weekend last year. The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus

feature new touchscreens that detect how hard they are pressed, upgraded 12

megapixel cameras and high-definition video recording. Apple sold 74.4 million

in the quarter after last September's launch, compared with the 65 million

expected by analysts. The iPhone 6S starts at £539 and the iPhone 6S Plus at

£619.
