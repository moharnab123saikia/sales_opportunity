million, Apple said yesterday. Advance orders for the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S
Plus were "very strong around the world", the company said. Sales of the new
handsets, to be released on September 25, will be boosted by China, which was
not included in the launch weekend last year. The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus
feature new touchscreens that detect how hard they are pressed, upgraded 12
megapixel cameras and high-definition video recording. Apple sold 74.4 million
in the quarter after last September's launch, compared with the 65 million
expected by analysts. The iPhone 6S starts at £539 and the iPhone 6S Plus at
£619.
