Apple's new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are on sale today and you can get your hands

on one of the new handsets now.



The two new mobile phones are available to buy right now in an Apple store or on

their website.



Both handsets are available on a range of networks including O2, EE, Vodafone,

Three and Virgin Mobile.



What is new about the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus?



The two new handsets will keep the same 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch sizes of the

current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones, but there is a new colour that has

been added to the range called rose gold.



Both the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have better cameras as opposed to the

current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus'.



A feature called Live Photos has been added to the iPhone 6s cameras which is on

by default and lets you record a 1.5 second long video, before and after your

shot. This means if you're taking a picture, the phone will capture the moments

around the shot.



Another great addition is the Retina flash mechanism, where the display of the

Apple iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. This means the new phones light up three times more

than its regular brightness and it considers ambient lighting so that when it's

dark you can still take selfies.
