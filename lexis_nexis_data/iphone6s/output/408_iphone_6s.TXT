Those waiting for Ap ple's latest phones from overseas via the grey market route

may no get them. And those planning to bring them from outside India without

paying duty might need to do a rethink as they could be fined Smugglers of the

newest iPhones may even face arrest.



Noticing a massive spurt in smug gled iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models

through Chhatrapati Shiv aji International Airport, Mumba customs authorities

have issued a press release informing fliers to "voluntarily declare iPhones to

customs on arrival."



They warned that passengers picked up after passing through the green channel

will be liable to pay a fine, penalty and customs duty . Ac cording to the

release, duty will be levied even on a single phone since the value of the

device exceeds the 'free allowance.' Passengers carry ing iPhones in commercial

quanti ty are liable to be arrested.



Additional Commissioner of Cus toms, Mumbai Airport, Milind Lan jewar confirmed

the developments to ET and said the rules already ex ist and are being

reiterated to travel ers. "For goods above ' . 45,000, techni cally passengers

have to declare bu most people are not aware of it. A du ty of 36% is levied on

the amoun above this limit," he said. Even if a single iPhone brought from over

seas exceeds the free allowance val ue, it would have to be declared and duty

would have to be paid.



The cheapest iPhone 6s, which comes with storage of 16GB, is list ed on Apple's

website as costing $649 (.'42,350) while the same mode on its Singapore website

can be pur chased for S$1,048 (. '48,000).



When value of undeclared goods rises above ' . 20 lakh, the authorities proceed

with arrests, Lanjewar added. The Mumbai Airport Cus toms authorities have

seized abou 200 of the latest iPhone models val ued at '. 1.23 crore over the

past two weeks. The phones were brough



into India by fliers coming from Singapore, Hong Kong, London, Dubai and other

countries. Author ities have since increased screen ing of checked-in and hand

baggage, besides profiling passengers.



ET reported last week, citing trade sources, that the iPhone 6s 16 GB would be

sold for ' . 62,000, 64 GB variant for ' . 72,000 and 128 GB version for '.

82,000, while the iPhone 6s Plus 16 GB would be priced at . 72,000, 64 GB at ' '

. 82,000 and 128 GB . 92,000. "As the models are still to at ' be launched in

India, passengers are trying to smuggle these iPhones for monetary benefit by

sale through grey market," the authorities have said.



The Mumbai seizure was not the only one. On Sunday , seven youth were detained

at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport with about 182 iPhone 6s and

6s Plus models brought in from Hong Kong and Singapore on separate flights,

officials said. With the launch 10 days away , they expect more such cases.



A customs official at Delhi airport said the department has tightened vigil for

all iPhone devices coming into India.
