WATCH: Turn your iPhone 6s into iPhone 7 in this wacky video



LENGTH: 187  words





Though iPhone 7 is not yet out in the stores, anyone who is desperate to have

one as early as now can tune into this weird two-minute YouTube video

instructing users how to turn their iPhone 6s into an iPhone 7.



In the viral video uploaded by Peripatetic Pandas on Tuesday, it demonstrates 10

'carefree' steps on how to engineer an iPhone 7 without knocking on Apple's

headquarters. First, the man in the video eliminated the headphone jack of the

iPhone 6s and then drilled two holes for dual speakers. The next outrageous step

he did was to get a spare iPhone 6 and snipped its camera and glued it onto the

other iPhone 6s prototype.



Then he firmly placed masking tape onto the phone's body and swooshed deep-blue

spray paint. It is whispered among tech news sites that the next flagship

product of Apple would wear its deep bluish coat.



After the spray painting procedure, he removed the masking tape and voila, the

'brand new' iPhone 7. To social media's 'bewilderment,' plenty of YouTube users

glorified Peripatetic Pandas for his creativity.



The hilarious do-it-yourself clip hast gotten 124,000 views as of this writing.
