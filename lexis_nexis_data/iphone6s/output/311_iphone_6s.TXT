Regular iPhone 6S expected to feature the 1080p resolution



By tbreak Staff -



Earlier, it was reported that both iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus were going to

feature a 12 MP rear camera sensor. Now according to another rumor, the

company's upcoming flagship phablet, iPhone 6S Plus, which is expected to have a

screen size of 5.5 inches, is going to radiate a resolution of 1440p, or in

other words, 2K resolution. Side by side, the iPhone 6S is expected to feature a

4.7 inch screen which also be upgraded to aÂ 1080p resolution.



While it is already known that Apple A9, the chipset expected to be present in

both smartphones is going to be processed on Samsung's superior 14 nm FinFET

process, the tech giant plans to raise the bar on the resolution side as well.

The company's previous flagship duo, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus featured

resolutions that measured 1334 by 750 and 1920 by 1080, respectively, which no

doubt prompted Apple to increase the overall pixel count on both its upcoming

smartphones.



While this news should be treated as a rumor for now, the company has invested a

sizable amount of $1.7 billion in JDI, which happens to be the largest display

maker in the world. With that much cash given to a supplier, you can rest

assured that the upcoming smartphone tag team is not going to be fitted with

something inferior.



However, the large amount of money allocated to a supplier could also be given

in order to put an extra engineering touch in these devices so that Apple's

Force Touch tech can be used properly. The Force Touch tech was initially

introduced in Apple Watch and looks like it is going to make its way to both

iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus.



Unfortunately, confirmation of all the aforementioned features can only be given

once Tim Cook takes center stage and unveils two of the most anticipated

handsets of 2015.
