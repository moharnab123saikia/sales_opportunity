Earlier, it was reported that both iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus were going to
feature a 12 MP rear camera sensor. Now according to another rumor, the
company's upcoming flagship phablet, iPhone 6S Plus, which is expected to have a
screen size of 5.5 inches, is going to radiate a resolution of 1440p, or in
other words, 2K resolution. Side by side, the iPhone 6S is expected to feature a
4.7 inch screen which also be upgraded to a 1080p resolution.

While it is already known that Apple A9, the chipset expected to be present in
both smartphones is going to be processed on Samsung's superior 14 nm FinFET
process, the tech giant plans to raise the bar on the resolution side as well.
The company's previous flagship duo, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus featured
resolutions that measured 1334 by 750 and 1920 by 1080, respectively, which no
doubt prompted Apple to increase the overall pixel count on both its upcoming
smartphones.

While this news should be treated as a rumor for now, the company has invested a
sizable amount of $1.7 billion in JDI, which happens to be the largest display
maker in the world. With that much cash given to a supplier, you can rest
assured that the upcoming smartphone tag team is not going to be fitted with
something inferior.

However, the large amount of money allocated to a supplier could also be given
in order to put an extra engineering touch in these devices so that Apple's
Force Touch tech can be used properly. The Force Touch tech was initially
introduced in Apple Watch and looks like it is going to make its way to both
iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus.

Unfortunately, confirmation of all the aforementioned features can only be given
once Tim Cook takes center stage and unveils two of the most anticipated
handsets of 2015.
