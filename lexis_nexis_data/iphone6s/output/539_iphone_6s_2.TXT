India, Oct. 9 -- Apple's much-awaited iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will cost Rs.

62,000 for the lowest storage variant and as much as Rs. 92,000 for the top end

model, distributors said. The India prices are much higher than those in

overseas markets such as the US and Singapore, which may deter buyers,

especially those intending to upgrade from iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.



Since its launch on September 25, the phone has been available on websites such

as eBay India, Quikr, Olx and Flipkart at fair prices. According to sources, the

16 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB variants of the iPhone 6s will be sold for Rs. 62,000,

Rs. 72,000 and Rs. 82,000 respectively and similar versions of the 6s Plus will

cost Rs. 72,000, Rs. 82,000 and Rs. 92,000.
