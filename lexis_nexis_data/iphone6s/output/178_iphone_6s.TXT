Both the iPhones get INR 22,000 price slash for their 128 GB variants, while

Apple fans prepare for new iPhone.



Is this the biggest price cut in the history of smartphone giant Apple in India?

Well, it certainly looks so, especially with the company's recent announcement

of INR 22,000 being slashed in the price tag of both iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S

Plus.



This means that, iPhone 6S 128 GB would, from now, be available at INR 60,000

(original price INR 82,000) and iPhone 6S Plus 128 GB will be available at INR

70,000.



It's not just this. The company has also slashed price on its 4 inch smartphone

iPhone SE by around INR 5,000, which means, the 64 GB device that was available

at INR 49,000 will now be available at INR 44,000. The price cut looks pretty

obvious with the latest iPhones launching in India on Oct 7.



To remind, Apple iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were launched in India in October last

year at price tags of INR 62,000 and INR 72,000 respectively; both being 16 GB

variant.



Both these iPhones feature 3D Touch, 2 GB RAM, 12 MP iSight camera and 5 MP

front FaceTime camera.
