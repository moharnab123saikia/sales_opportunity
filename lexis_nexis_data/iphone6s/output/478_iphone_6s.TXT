new iPhone 6S smartphone has revealed that removing the handset's 3D Touch
sensor from the rest of the display is fairly easy.

The iFixit team has also said that the change accompanying the removal of the 3D
Touch sensor in iPhone 6S from the rest of the handset's display can seemingly
make the fixing of the iPhones much simpler.

The teardown by the iFixit team has revealed that though the 3D Touch assembly
in the iPhone 6S is at the extreme rear side of the handset's display panel, it
is still relatively easy to separate the 3D Touch sensor from the backlight,
digitizer glass, and even the display itself.

The iFixit team has also said that, on the basis of a detailed examination of
the iPhone 6S handset's 3D Touch panel, it has been found that the panel chiefly
consists of a grid of rectangular capacitor plates, which are connected to a
controller circuit via small traces.

Meanwhile, despite the fairly easy process of removal of the iPhone 6S handset's
3D Touch panel from the rest of the handset's display, the iFixit team has said
that the disassembling and reassembling of a smartphone display should not be
undertaken by an average person because the process requires the use of very
specialized tools.
