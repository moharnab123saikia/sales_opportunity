APPLE said yesterday that sales of its new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are on track to

beat last year's record-breaking iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sales on the first weekend

they hit the shops.



"Customer response to iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus has been extremely positive

and pre-orders this weekend were very strong around the world. We are on pace to

beat last year's 10m unit first weekend record when the new iPhones go on sale

September 25," the technology giant said in a statement to CNBC.



The California-headquartered company said it had experienced large demand

online, but did not reveal exact figures. Analysts have estimated sales of

around 4.5m during the first 24 hours, compared with 4m during the first day

last year.



"As many customers noticed, the online demand for iPhone 6s Plus has been

exceptionally strong and exceeded our own forecasts for the pre-order period. We

are working to catch up as quickly as we can, and we will have iPhone 6s Plus as

well as iPhone 6s units available at Apple retail stores when they open next

Friday," it said.



Last year's record sales beat that of the previous iPhone 5s and 5C in 2013,

which stood at 9m after three days.



Investors and analysts have voiced concerns over whether Apple can sustain its

growth momentum, but the market seemed reassured yesterday. Shares in Apple were

up by nearly two per cent in early trading and closed 0.96 per cent higher.
