iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, beginning Friday, October 16th 12:01 am onwards,
at over 3500 retail locations across India.

The company, which is an authorised distributor of Apple phones, said that the
new iPhones will be available post midnight, on October 16, and that its
retailers will organise midnight launch events at select outlets across India.

Ingram Micro, another Apple's product distributor in India, also said Tuesday
morning that it will offer the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus smartphones at more
than 2,500 retail locations in over 80 cities across the country.

Apple is offering its flagship smartphones in the Indian market within three
weeks of its US launch, compared with a month and more in previous cases. Last
year, it launched the product a month after the US launch. It is using its
existing set of distributors including Redington to get sales going.

Apple started selling the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models in the US on September
25. On Monday, the company said it sold 13 million handsets in three days of the
launch.

While Apple has yet to announce the price of the new models in India, as per
trade estimates the 16 GB iPhone 6s will be priced around Rs 55,000-56,000 and
iPhone 6s Plus 16 GB around Rs 65,000-66,000. The prices will be much higher for
the 64 GB and 128 GB models.

Some price comparison sites are pegging the prices even higher - around Rs
70,000 for 16 GB iPhone 6s variant.
