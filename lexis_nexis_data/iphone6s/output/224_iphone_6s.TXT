"The high-end package of Dh1,000 per month for 24 months will get 2,500 flexi

minutes, 25GB of data, gold number and every year two free iPhones," du said.



By pre-ordering with a new postpaid number from du, subscribers can avail many

smart plans and Emirati plans worth Dh300, Dh600 and Dh1,000 which offer free

talk time, data, SMS and free minutes for up to three preferred UAE numbers.

As for the retailers, some said they will be getting enough stocks compared to

last year while others said that they were not looking to stack their stands for

Gitex Shopper since the event would be winding up on October 11.



Last year, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus did make for brisk sales at Shopper stands but

retailers ran out of stocks within a few hours.
