Recent rumors suggest that the latest Apple iPhone 7 lineup might sport a
waterproof body and new antenna concealing technology as well.

The latest news is that Catcher Technologies will be providing 30 to 35 percent
of the chassis components for upcoming iPhones, says Taiwan's Commercial Times.
The possibility of a waterproof iPhone design was previously rumored, but the
news about the antenna changes is new. Apple could conceivably be hoping to
integrate the part into the chassis itself. However, thanks to the added gasket
and various silicone seals, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are already quite water
resistant, but going waterproof would involve a thorough redesign, such as
figuring out how to seal off ports, switches and buttons.

The new materials also suggest that Apple might be considering a non metal
chassis. Ever since the iPhone 5, Apple has tended to stick towards an
all-aluminum design, but other materials might improve structural stability and
/ or reduce manufacturing costs. Apple has used the tougher 7000 series aluminum
for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but that comes at an extra price.

Apple is also rumored to launch a new 4 inch iPhone 6c this March or April,
while the iPhone 7 might make it to the markets in September.
