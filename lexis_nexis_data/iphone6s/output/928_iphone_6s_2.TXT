Apple has slashed prices of its Indian bestseller iPhone 5s for the third time

in three months, bringing them down to almost half of September levels, in a bid

to shore up sales as demand for flagships iPhone 6s and 6s Plus has nosedived

after Diwali. iPhone 5s prices now starts at ' . 24,999, down from . 44,500 in

September.' This makes Indian price of iPhone 5s one of the lowest globally,

despite the depreciating rupee and higher import taxes making India among

markets where Apple products cost the most, retailers and analysts said.



"iPhone 6s and 6s Plus sales has again dampened after a brief period of pick up

during Diwali, which prompted Apple to successively bring down price of iPhone

5s," a senior executive with a leading retail chain said.



"This is interesting since iPhone 5s has been their best seller in the Indian

market and companies seldom drop prices such frequently for popular models," he

said.



Retailers say iPhone 5s accounts for almost 50% of total iPhone sales in India.

Apple had lowered the price of iPhone 5s during Dussehra in October and then

again before Diwali in November.



An email sent to Apple did not elicit any response as of press time Sunday .

According to trade sources, the



US tech giant's latest move is triggered by its plans to double India sales in

the crucial October-December quarter, a high sales period for App le globally as

it's the



launch period of new iPhones.



"The $250-400 '27,000) pri '16,000\xAD.(.ce band is where Apple wants to focus

its energies in India since they



want to lock in more consumers into their eco-system which would build up a base

for upgradation when newer iPhones are launched and also since Indian consumers

find the latest iPhone model prices higher," said Tarun Pathak, senior telecom

analyst at Counterpoint Research.



Pathak said this price band is one of the least competitive and where Indian

consumers typically look for the brand factor in purchase. He said the total

number of consumers in India in the iPhone 5 series was 1.2 million until

September 2015, of the total number of 3.5 million iPhone users who either own

the older or latest model.



Retailers said the price cut would help Apple compete better with top smartphone

maker Samsung.



"Samsung's A and E series smartphones are operating in this price band, but the

Korean firm has not yet launched any newer models in these segments, hence Apple

can significantly gain share this quarter," a senior executive with a leading

cellphone chain said.
