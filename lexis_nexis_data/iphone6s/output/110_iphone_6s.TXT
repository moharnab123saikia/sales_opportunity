Apple has finally revealed its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the firm's first

smartphone to boast both water and dust resistance .



Unveiled during the firm's hotly-anticipated launch event in San Francisco

today, the new iPhone doesn't look too different to last year's iPhone 6S and

iPhone 6S Plus devices, sporting the same aluminium design and rounded edges -

but this time without the iconic antenna lines.



As with the iPhone 6 and 6s, both new iPhone devices come with different storage

options. This year, Apple has doubled the capacities available when the device

launches.



The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will therefore be available in 32GB, 128GB or

256GB options.



Apple said during its keynote that it has kept the prices of its new smartphones

the same as the iPhone 6s when it launched last year for their respective

storage options.



However, because the 16GB is no longer available, this means the cheapest option

is now more expensive.



In the UK, Apple said the iPhone 7 will be available from a starting price of

£599 for the cheapest 32GB option.



The 128GB version is £699 and the 256GB version will set you back a whopping

£799.



The larger iPhone 7 Plus will be even more of a wallet buster than it's smaller

sibling.



The cheapest (32GB) iPhone 7 Plus costs £719, followed by a 128GB model at£819,

and then a 256GB variant costing an astonishing £919.



Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will come in the usual Black, Gold, Silver,

Rose Gold colour options, alongside a new black called simply "Jet Black", which

is much darker than previous black models.



They will be available to pre-order from 9 September before they start shipping

on 16 September in the UK.



You can pre-order via the Apple store from now.

The good news for those not wanting to splash out hundreds for a brand new

smartphone is that Apple has slashed the price of its iPhone 6S models after the

launch of the iPhone 7.



Apple has taken £100 off its previous generation smartphones, so the cheapest

16GB edition of the iPhone 6s is now available for £499 - down from £539

previously.



The price of the iPhone 6s Plushas also been slashed from £619 to £599 for the

16GB model.



The really good news, though, is that Apple has boosted the storage of those

entry-level editions of the 6s and 6s Plus to 32GB - which is much more

practical.



All the UK networks will of course be offering contract deals shortly after the

iPhone 7 announcement, so we'll update this article once we know more.
