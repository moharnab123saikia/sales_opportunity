THIS MORNING Apple began selling its new iPhone SE handset, a dimin-utive

four-inch device that looks almost identical to 2013's iPhone 5. However,

despite bucking the trend for gigantic handsets, the SE manages to squeeze

virtually all the high-end gadgetry from Apple's flagship iPhone 6s, including

the new A9 processor, a 12 megapixel camera, and the ability to shoot 4K video.

The main feature it lacks, 3D Touch (a pressure sensitive screen that allows

previews and extra options), is unlikely to put off many buyers, with iPhone 6s

users finding it underwhelming.



While the SE is unlikely to persuade many iPhone 6s users to downsize, early

figures suggest it is already poaching Android users. According to Slice

Intelligence, only a third of SE pre-orders are from users who bought an iPhone

online in the past two years, compared with 49 per cent of iPhone 6s buyers. The

SE is also relatively cheap, starting at just Â£359.



It was described in City A.M. as "an exceptional handset at an exceptional

price", adding: "It's the best little phone in the world."
