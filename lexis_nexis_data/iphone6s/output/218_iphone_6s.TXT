the size of the new iphones has been done but a new kind of 'strongest' glass on

the screen has been introduced by the Company.

videos with better resolution. There is a new 5-megapixel FaceTime HD camera

inbuilt in new iPhones that can take more detailed photos. Schiller said that

the flash on the camera offers TrueTone lighting, which matches the light with

the ambient lighting. Most interesting feature in the new iPhones is of 'Live

Photos' that allows details in the photos to move like moving waterfall with the

sound of rushing water.
