 Kansas: Sprint Corporation has issued the following Press release:







  The iPhone Forever Revolution continues. Starting on September 25, qualified

Sprint customers can get iPhone 6s for $15 per month and iPhone 6s Plus for $19

per month, making it the most affordable way to get the new iPhones on Sprint.

Customers who choose not to trade in an existing smartphone at time of purchase

can get iPhone 6s for $22 per month and iPhone 6s Plus for $26 per month. And

with the innovative iPhone Forever program, included in the price, Sprint

customers can now get a new iPhone every year.





 iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus bring a powerful new dimension to iPhone&rsquo;s

revolutionary Multi-Touch interface with 3D Touch, which senses how deeply you

press the display, letting you do all kinds of essential things more quickly and

simply. The new iPhones introduce Live Photos, which bring still images to life,

transforming instants frozen in time into unforgettable living memories. Live

Photos, 3D Touch, 12-megapixel iSight camera, 5-megapixel FaceTime HD camera

with Retina Flash and more are powered by the Apple-designed A9 chip, the most

advanced chip ever in a smartphone, delivering faster performance and great

battery life. iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are designed from the strongest glass

on any smartphone and 7000 series aluminum, the same alloy used in the aerospace

industry, in gorgeous metallic finishes that now include rose gold.



 &ldquo;iPhone Forever is Sprint&rsquo;s latest and greatest option to get these

amazing new iPhones. It is a revolutionary program that fundamentally changes

the way our customers will get Apple&rsquo;s most iconic devices. For a very low

monthly payment, new or existing Sprint Customers will be able to get iPhone 6s

from Sprint and be guaranteed to get a new iPhone every year. I cannot imagine a

better way to have the latest iPhone."
