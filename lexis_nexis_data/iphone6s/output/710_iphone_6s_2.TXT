The iPhone 6S has just come out, but that won't stop Apple from focusing on the

iPhone 7. Neither will it stop the rumours surrounding it.



After the huge bendgate debacle of the iPhone 6, Apple used reinforced 7000

series aluminium on the iPhone 6S. However, recent rumours suggest that Apple

might take it a step further with iPhone 7, making it the first waterproof

iPhone. Recent rumours reports a number of iPhone prototypes sporting rubberized

edges and features. There were previous rumours of Apple researching a variety

of waterproofing technologies such as silicon seals for entry points and

encapsulated SoC processors.



Earlier waterproofing tests for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus showed it to last

under water for surprisingly up to an hour, suggesting Apple is already on its

way to waterproof phones. However we do not recommend you to try diving with

your iPhone yet. If compulsory, get some water proofing accessories or simply

wait for the iPhone 7 and hope that the rumours are true.
