New Delhi, Sept. 15 -- Weeks ahead of the impending India launch of iPhone 7 and

7 Plus, Apple has slashed prices of the previous generation handsets - iPhone 6S

and 6S Plus - by up to Rs 22,000.



The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, launched earlier this month in the US, are

slated to hit the Indian market from October 7, with prices starting at Rs

60,000.



There is usually a price drop for the previous versions when a new model is

announced by Apple.



According to industry sources, the iPhone 6S (128GB variant) will now be

available at Rs 60,000 from its earlier price tag of Rs 82,000 - a reduction of

Rs 22,000.



The iPhone 6s Plus (128GB variant) will see a similar cut and will be available

for Rs 70,000.



The 64GB version of iPhone SE, which was launched in March this year, will now

be available for Rs 44,000, down from Rs 49,000.



Apple did not comment on the reduction in prices.



The Cupertino-based company is betting big on the Indian market. In July, Apple

CEO Tim Cook had said that India is one of its fastest growing markets.



"In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were

up 51 per cent year-on-year," he had said on an investor call.



The company has also announced setting up of a design and development

accelerator to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for

iOS and has opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate maps development.



Cook, who visited India in May, had discussed issues including manufacturing and

setting up retail stores in the country with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
