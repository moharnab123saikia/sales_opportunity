Apple launched a huge range of new computing products at perhaps the biggest

event in the tech giant's history yesterday, including one that its late founder

swore that it would never release.



"If you see a stylus, they blew it," Steve Jobs said when he launched the first

iPhone in 2007. Last night, Apple launched its Pencil - a new product that looks

a lot like a stylus.



The Pencil was launched as a way of interacting with the iPad Pro, the company's

huge new businessfocused tablet. As well as the new iPad, Apple showed off the

iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, a new Apple TV and new accessories for the Apple Watch.



The pitch for the iPad Pro relied largely on the success of the existing iPads,

the look of which has been heavily borrowed in the new iPad Pro. But the new

screen is much bigger - at 12.9in, it is the same size as Apple's MacBooks and

almost twice the size of its smaller iPads.



Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive officer, said the Pro was the "biggest news in

iPad since the iPad" and the company's vision for the future of personal

computing. Prices were announced as starting at $799 (£520).



On-stage demonstrations used the extra screen space of the iPad Pro to show apps

including those for retouching photos and examining the human body. On the

latter, a person was shown using the Apple Pencil to remove and add bits of

muscle and bone from a virtual human body, using an app that is intended for

medical students.



Apple opted to leave the latest upfate to its most popular product - the iPhone

6S - until the end. The phone looks almost identical on the outside to the old

version, apart from a new "rose gold" colour option.



Prices for the iPhone 6S start at £539, or £619 for the iPhone 6S Plus.



Customers will able to pre-order the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus from 8.01am on

Saturday, and they will be in stores from 25 September in 12 countries including

the UK.
