Apple 'expected to cut production of iPhones 6S and 6S Plus by 30%' amid

lacklustre sales

Apple suppliers are bracing for a possible 30% cut in production of the iPhone

6s and 6S Plus as inventories of the smartphone pile up.



Asian companies that make parts for the devices told Japanese financial

newspaper Nikkei that they expected Apple would change its plans to keep

production of the devices at the same level that its predecessors - the iPhone 6

and 6 Plus - were at a year earlier.



Sales of the devices, which were launched in September, hit a record 13 million

in their first three days on the market, but it is thought demand has since

tailed off.



Research from Accenture indicates that smartphone demand in general is on the

wane: 48% of the 28,000 consumers it polled said they planned to buy a

smartphone this year, down six percentage points on last year.



Nikkei said the 6S and 6S Plus were still well-stocked in retailers across

China, Japan, Europe and the US as customers found they were little improved

from the earlier versions. The strong dollar was also weighing as prices leapt

in emerging markets.

However, Analyst Daniel Ives of FBR & Co has said the fears about the effects of

the sales slowdown as well as the economic woes of key market China on Apple are

overblown.



He acknowledged it was a "turbulent" time for the company, but believes the

company will still hit forecasts for iPhone sales.



Nevertheless, the Nikkei report hit the shares of UK company ARM which provides

chips for the phones. It was down 3.5% at 968p and was one of the FTSE 100's

biggest losers in early trading.
