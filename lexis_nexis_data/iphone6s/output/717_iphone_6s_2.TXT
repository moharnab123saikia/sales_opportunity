

In a statement released on Monday, tech giant Apple said that the initial sales
of its next-generation iPhones - iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus - will likely beat
the opening-weekend record set by the iPhone 6 models last year.

According to Apple's disclosure, the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus handsets
witnessed "very strong" preorders during the opening weekend; with the brisk
sales of the new handsets apparently on pace to surpass last year's
opening-weekend preorder record of 10 million units.

The new iPhones were unveiled by Apple at an event held in San Francisco on
September 9; and the preorders for the new handsets were opened on September 12.
The handsets are scheduled to hit store shelves on September 25.

Apple's predictions that the initial sales of the new iPhones during the opening
weekend will exceed the figures recorded by the last year iPhone models are
largely based on the fact that the demand of the new iPhones in China have been
quite strong. China has, this year, been added as one of the countries in which
Apple has made the new iPhones available for preorders at the outset.

Going by the predictions of Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster, the
opening-weekend sales of the new iPhones will likely touch 13 million units;
with nearly 2 million shipments attributable to China.
