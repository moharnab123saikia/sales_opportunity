NEW DELHI: The 4-inch. Targeted to consumers who prefer to use a smaller

smartphone, the new iPhone is bit of the older 6 and 6S models in the body of

the 5S. It will come in Rose Gold, Gold, Silver and Gray colour options. Running

iOS 9.3, the iPhone SE has Touch ID but doesn't feature 3D Touch.



The iPhone SE is expected to be available in India for a starting price of Rs

30,000 for the 16GB version. So, here is a quick comparison among the base
