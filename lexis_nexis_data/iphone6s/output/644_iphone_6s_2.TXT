As of September 12, shipping wait times on the new iPhone 6S Plus in China is

running at three to four weeks, and two to three weeks for the 6S.

"Demand is stronger in China than in most regions of the world including the

US", said Arik Hesseldahl, senior editor of US tech website Re/code.net, citing

the statistics unveiled by an Apple news blog.



The iPhone inventory blog tracks the back-order status of various iPhone models

by way of screen shots of Apple's estimated wait times. As of September 12,

shipping wait times on the new iPhone 6S Plus in China is running at three to

four weeks, and two to three weeks for the 6S.



According to Hesseldahl, one caveat to the data is that there's no indication on

how much inventory was allocated by region or carrier. It's also the first day

of pre-orders and this data is about as preliminary as you can get.



Apple Inc reported third-quarter earnings in July with revenue in Greater China

reaching $13.2 billion, an increase of 112 percent year-over-year, and the sale

of iPhones climbing 85 percent.



According to previous reports by China Daily, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the

growth in Greater China was "outstanding" -- the Mac App Store's revenue more

than doubled in China and the company intends to open 40 new stores in China by

the middle of next year.



"Obviously I can't predict the future, but our performance so far this quarter

is reassuring. Additionally, I continue to believe China represents an

unprecedented opportunity over the long term," Cook wrote to American news

television channel CNBC recently in comments about the company's business in

China.



Traditionally, Apple announces its first-weekend sales after a big launch on the

following Monday.
