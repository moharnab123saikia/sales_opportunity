HIGHLIGHT:Â Latest phone a leap in technology





CRISTIAN Nugent woke up at the crack of dawn to make sure he was the first in

line in Toowoomba to get the latest iPhone.



The iPhone 6s was released yesterday and Apple enthusiasts were queuing at the

Telstra Shop Grand Central from 6am.



Mr Nugent said it was worth the wait to be one of the first people in Toowoomba

to have the new iPhone.



"I've had all the iPhones and the new technology on this phone just looks

awesome," he said.



"I think there is always so much hype around the new phones because people like

to have the latest and best things.



"It's pretty exciting to be one of the first people to own one plus it's cool I

have a pink phone now."



As the first person to walk away with the new iPhone, Mr Nugent received a pair

of Beats Studio headphones, valued at $400.



"I expected to walk away with a new phone but not a pair of headphones as well.

It's been a good morning," he said.



The features of the new iPhone 6s include 3D touch, upgrade to the front-facing

and live photos. It's also faster and has sturdier glass.



Telstra Shop Grand Central store leader Ian Bryant said there were 28 staff

members working to keep up with demand.



"This time of year is iPhone Christmas. The rush starts now and will continue

for up to four weeks," he said.



"There are a lot of people out there who have been waiting for this phone to

come out.



"Every September Apple brings out a new iPhone and at Telstra we have new phone

feeling, which means customers can upgrade every single year without having to

cancel their contract.



"This is an in-between model and normally they only have minor changes but the

iPhone 6s is a huge leap forward in technology.



"It is amazing and all future technology will take after it."
