iPhone 7 Plus to boast increased storage and battery

The rumor mills have been going on overdrive with speculations, leaks and rumors

of the iPhone 7 and a Plus variant ever since the iPhone 6s came out. The latest

news however, says that the iPhone 7 Plus may come with an increased storage and

battery.



A recent report from Chinese media site MyDrivers stated that the iPhone will be

getting a major upgrade this year. The iPhone 7 Plus might apparently be getting

external design changes, specifically new 256GB storage configuration and a

larger internal battery, rumored to be 3100 mAH. The batteries had in fact

gotten smaller with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, 2750 mAH and 2915 mAH

respectively.



Battery life of the iPhone is a complaint shared by many iPhone users, and is

often used as a comparative element with other Android devices. If this rumor is

true, the iPhone 7 Plus will have an increase of 10% battery life as compared to

the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Although mAH does not actually convert do battery

life, it does indicate that the chips and circuit boards will get more efficient

over time.



Raising the storage of the device could also suggest that Apple could be

changing up the storage across the board, thus heeding to another popular

complaint that the 16GB is just too small. With higher megapixel cameras, HD and

4K videos, users do require larger space to store all their photos and videos.

However, the report specifically claims that the 256GB storage might come only

for the iPhone 7 Plus.



The new iPhone 7 and Plus variant, are expected to come out during fall, but

there are also rumors of another 4 inch iPhone 6c set to be revealed at Apple's

press event in March.
