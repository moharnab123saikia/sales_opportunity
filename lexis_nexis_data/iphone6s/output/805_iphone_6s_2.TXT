is it?

Enthusiasm in China drove sales of Apple's latest iPhone to a record 13m units
last weekend, topping last year's record of 10m, when the manufacturer's popular
phone was held up in China by regulators. Analysts put sales in China at between
3m and 4m units, leaving sales elsewhere essentially flat year-over-year.

The company allowed 16 days for its presale period (last year it gave itself 10)
and the phone officially went on sale 25 September. It will continue to roll out
around the world through October.

"Sales for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any
previous first weekend sales results in Apple's history," wrote Apple CEO Tim
Cook, in a press release.

The devices' success is a testament to the reliability of Apple's user base,
said Ramon Llamas, a mobile market analyst for International Data Corporation
(IDC).

"The fact that this is an S version and not a whole new body type version speaks
to how much clout Apple has with end-users out there," Llamas said. "People
usually wait for the new version, but there's a sizable number that says: 'No,
we'd rather have the incremental version and move forward.'"

The popularity of the devices is also likely to make for greater Apple Watch
adoption, Llamas said - or at least to remove a barrier to Apple Watch adoption,
since the watch only works with iOS devices.

The phone's major upgrades include what Apple is calling 3D touch, in which the
touchscreen responds not solely to touch but to pressure, as well, and the
standard camera megapixel and processor improvements. Llamas said he expects to
see the "home" button disappear before long.
