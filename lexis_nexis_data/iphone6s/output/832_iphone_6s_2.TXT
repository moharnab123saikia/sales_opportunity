NEW DELHI: Apple Sunday denied a recent report that prices of iPhones in India

have been raised by 29%, as retail prices that it offers have remain unchanged.



The Cupertino-based smartphone maker's retail prices for the 16 GB variants of

the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6, as per its website, are at still at Rs 62,000 and Rs

52,000, respectively.



However, prices on ecommerce sites and retail stores keep fluctuating as

consumers are offered discounts to keep sales going in an intensely competitive

smartphone market.



Since Apple does not control the final prices offered to customers at online or

offline retail stores, the same iPhone model is available for different prices

at multiple outlets.



In case of iPhones, the sales channels have reduced the discounts which has lead

to prices of the models to firm up, said two retailers. But they added that

Apple on its own has not communicated any increase in prices.



A recent news report pegged the iPhone 6 16GB version at Rs 40,000 and that of

iPhone 6s at Rs 48,000, presently, compared to their month-old prices of Rs

31,000 and Rs 40,500, respectively. The report suggests the iPhone 6 to have the

steepest price rise of 29%



The iPhone 5s, the most popular of the iPhones in India, is now priced at Rs

22,000 against Rs 18,000 about a month ago, the report said, attributing the

surprise price hike to the muted consumer response to the iPhone SE. The Apple's

new model was launched in India earlier this month for Rs 39,000 for 16 GB,

while it's 64 GB variant was priced at Rs 49,000.



Apple however maintained that it has not altered retail prices in India.



In order to drive sales, Apple has introduced EMI schemes for consumers

purchasing the iPhone SE. It has also targeted the enterprise user with lease

plans beginning from Rs 999 a month for iPhone SE, going upwards for iPhone 6

and iPhone 6s.



Online retailers are selling the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 5s at around Rs

42,000, Rs 49,000 and Rs 21,000 marks, respectively, indicating even more the

fluctuating nature of the prices.
