One lucky woman was the first in line to receive the only iPhone 6S Plus stocked

at the Mandurah Forum Telstra store on Friday morning.



The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were unveiled by Apple in San Francisco earlier this

month.



Mandurah Forum Telstra manager Jason Matesich said they had 100 iPhone 6Ss and

just one iPhone 6S Plus.



'We expect customers to be queuing outside the Forum doors by this afternoon,'

he said.



'I have all my staff working today and more stock arriving this afternoon.'



The new phones have front and rear cameras, upgraded processors and RAM,

always-on Siri, and a pressure-sensitive three-dimensional touch screen similar

to the force touch screen on the Apple Watch.
