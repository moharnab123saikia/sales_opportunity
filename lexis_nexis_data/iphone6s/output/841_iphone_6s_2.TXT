

APPLE sold more than  13 million new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus smartphones in the
first three days of sale.

The figure is a record for Apple, having sold  10 million of the iPhone 6 and 6
Plus when it went on sale last year.

The new 6s model has a better camera, faster processor, and a pressure-
sensitive screen for the first time.

Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, said: "Sales have been phenomenal, blowing
past any previous first weekend sales results in Apple's history.

"Customers' feedback is incredible and they are loving 3D Touch and Live Photos.
We can't wait to bring iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to customers in more
countries."

Following the launch of the iPhone 6 last year  - Apple went on to sell more
than 70 million units in three months - and post the largest ever quarterly
profit by a public company in history of Â£11.8 billion.

Despite suggestions that demand could drop given the modest upgrades to  the
device, the addition of China as a launch day country for the first time is
likely to have boosted demand once again.

Apple confirmed the new iPhones will also launch in 40 more countries on October
9, and reach 130 countries by the end of the year.
