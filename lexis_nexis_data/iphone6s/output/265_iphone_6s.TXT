

APPLE said yesterday it had sold 13 million of its new iPhones over the weekend,
in a record-breaking launch for the latest model of its iconic smartphone.
  The California tech giant began selling the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in nine
markets, including China, on Friday.


 The company said the devices would be available in 40 additional markets from
October 9 including Italy, Mexico, Russia, Spain and Taiwan.
  "Sales for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any
previous first weekend sales results in Apple's history," said chief executive
Tim Cook.
  The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus have the same overall dimensions as the last
version, with new technologies under the hood.
  One of the key new features is called "3D touch," which responds to the level
of pressure exerted on the screen, allowing users to apply light pressure to
peek at messages and applications, and to press a little deeper to open them.
  The 6S has the 12cm display of its predecessor and the 6S Plus - which updates
one of the more popular handsets in the "phablet category" - has the same 165cm
screen.
  But the devices have more powerful processors that allow for improved
graphics, harder glass and a new aluminium body. Pricing will be kept at the
same levels as the earlier versions.
  Analysts at IHS Technology project said Apple would ship 236 million iPhones
this year, up 22% from a year ago.
  IHS analyst Ian Fogg said, "For its next model, Apple is going to have to find
a way to reinvent the iPhone, and it is hard to find something that is radically
new."
 Apple's new phone also features upgraded operating system iOS 9, which the
company says offers "more intelligence" while taking up less space.
  Apple said that it would roll out the new devices in the coming weeks and that
they would be available in 130 countries by the end of the year. - AFP
