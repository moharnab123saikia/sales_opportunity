Hold the iPhone 6S (11.9cm screen) and 6s Plus (14cm screen) in your hand and

the mantra about looking beyond face value comes to mind. But start using the

phone and you can see some differences.



Apple has thrown out the label Force Touch and now calls it 3D Touch. The clever

combination of software and hardware means the device can sense the amount of

force you use in a touch and offer a variety of options in response. 3D Touch

and the "quick look" feature Apple is calling "peek-and-pop" could come with a

similar explainer.



Press a bit and you "peek" at a pop-up of information. Press a little harder and

you "pop" through to the next level of information or to a particular feature

within an app.



The 6s/6s Plus rear camera is now a 12 megapixel camera.The front camera goes

from 1.5 megapixels to 5 megapixels and now has a flash. It is the first iPhone

that can shoot and edit 4K video. It is also made out of a tougher grade of

aluminium and has a tougher glass screen.



It will run iOS 9, the new operating system available as a free update for

download on older Apple devices on September 16. And it will be faster - there

will be a faster chip and faster wi-fi. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus is available

for preorder from tomorrow and will be available on September 25. Prices: iPhone

6S: $1079 for 16Gb model; $1229 for 64Gb, and $1370 for 127Gb. iPhone 6s Plus:

$1229 for 16GB model, $1379 for the 64GB model and $1529 for 128Gb.
