Now that we finally have an official date for Apple's iPhone 6s launch event,

it's only natural to expect the number of iPhone-related leaks to increase in

volume over the next week or so.



While we already know a lot about what the iPhone 6s will have in store (Force

Touch, 2GB of RAM, A9 processor), 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman on Thursday divulged

some new details surrounding the iPhone 6s camera. Suffice it to say, Apple's

next-gen iPhone may be even more of a compelling upgrade than previously

imagined.



Now, the 8-megapixel camera on the iPhone 6 is certainly respectable, especially

since Apple has skillfully implemented some of its traditional software magic to

truly create a best-in-class smartphone camera. With the iPhone 6s, however,

Apple is poised to bring iPhone photo quality to the next level.



According to Gurman, the iPhone 6s (and the 6s Plus, of course) will be graced

with a 12-megapixel camera.



The 12-megapixel camera will mean that the new iPhones will be able to take

larger, higher-resolution photos than before. Because of an upgraded image

signal processor that comes as part of the new A9 system-on-a-chip, the new

sensor will not wash out or otherwise decrease the quality of photos, according

to sources.



This should certainly be welcome news for photo-minded iPhone users, especially

given that Android handsets from the likes of Samsung and Sony have really made

photo quality strides of their own in recent months.



Gurman's report also adds that Apple's upcoming iPhone models will be able to

record video in 4K quality. Not to be overlooked, Apple will also be enhancing

the iPhone's front-facing camera, which should make forÂ crisper FaceTime video

calls.



All in all, Apple's iPhone 6s upgrades should be sufficiently compelling to

usher in what will likely be Apple's largest iPhone refresh cycle to date.
