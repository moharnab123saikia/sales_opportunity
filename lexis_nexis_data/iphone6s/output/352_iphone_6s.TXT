Camera and Video. The iPhone 6S's camera got a massive upgrade with a

12-megapixel iSight camera and a two-tone flash. The increase in pixels improves

the detail in photos, but Apple claims that image quality won't be degraded

thanks to new technology like "deep trench isolation," which separates the

photodiodes to maintain accurate colours.



3D Touch. Apple's new 3D touch-enabled screen takes multitouch to the next level

by adding a third dimension: pressure. It's kind of like Force Touch on the

Apple Watch, but with special features for the iPhone and different levels of

pressure. Apple calls it "3D Touch." A light press on the screen will bring up a

preview of content, whether it be an image, a website, or an itinerary. If you

keep pressing, you'll enter the content you selected.It allows you to dip in and

out of where you are without losing context.



Faster Processor. Apple's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are powered by the A9 64-bit

processor, which boasts a new transistor architecture for better energy

efficiency. Apple says it's 70 per cent faster than the A8 at CPU tasks, and 90

per cent faster at graphics tasks than the A8. An onboard M9 co-processor is

always on to track steps and other fitness metrics.



Pricing and Availability. Apple will sell the iPhone 6S (16GB) for $1079 and the

iPhone 6S Plus (16GB) for $1229. The new phones come out on September 25th, and

you can pre-order now on www.apple.com.au.
