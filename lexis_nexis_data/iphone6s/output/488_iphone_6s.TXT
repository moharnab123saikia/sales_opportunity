iPhone 6c to use FinFET chips for better performance and reduced power

consumption

Looks like the iPhone 5c successor is going to be loaded with some impressive

hardware

While seeing an iPhone 6c is not going to be happen during any remaining month

of 2015, all that might change next year. In addition to releasing its iPhone 6s

and iPhone 6s Plus, Apple is also intending on releasing a lesser performing

iPhone 6c. Now, we have received information that the upcoming smartphone is

going to have a much bigger performance margin as compared to iPhone 5c, because

iPhone 6c is going to feature FinFET chips.



Sources close to the information claim that iPhone 6c is either going to be

incorporated with TMSC's 16nm FinFET chips, or Samsung's 14nm FinFET ones. There

were reports coming in that iPhone 6c would feature Apple's chipset that would

be based on TSMC's 20nm process, but that would not allow the handset to possess

impressive processing power and energy efficiency like FinFET chips are able to

deliver. Apple's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are expected to be released during

the month of September, and will feature impressive specifications, including a

20nm Cat 6 LTE modem from Qualcomm.



Apple will be looking to exclude home buttons from its next lineup of iPhones

(after iPhone 6s), so we will be looking forward to that kind of innovation. As

for the specifications that we do know about iPhone 6c, the handset is expected

to feature a 4 inch display with a much higher resolution as compared to iPhone

5c. Moreoever, Apple might exclude 16 GB iPhones from its production, so it

looks like we will be looking at a 32 GB iPhone 6c in the future.



Having FinFET chips installed in smartphones has many benefits, with the two

primary ones being improved efficiency and very impressive performance. Unlike

iPhone 5c, we expect iPhone 6c to feature a slightly larger price tag thanks to

its improved hardware.
