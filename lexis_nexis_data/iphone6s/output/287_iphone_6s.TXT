After brick-andmortar retailers, it's now the urn of India's e-tailing giants to

gear up for Apple's 6S and 6S Plus launch, which is slated to rake in domestic

revenues in excess of '6,000 crore for the US tech company. Apple plans to sell

more han 10 lakh units of its new phone in India, and half of it s expected to

happen through the online route. This will also reduce the chances of offline

retailers charging a scarcity premium, say industry experts.



The new phones will hit he shelves on October 16 at a price ranging between '

62,000 or the 16GB iPhone 6S and ' 92,000 for the 128GB iPhone 6S Plus. While

offline retailers have already started taking bookings for the launch, their

online counterparts have readied a war chest that includes delivery on launch

day , cashbacks, assured buybacks and great trade-in values.



For instance, Snapdeal, one of Apple's largest partners here, is bundling an in

eresting assured buyback offer with the iPhone 6S.



"Within six months of purchase, if you want to sell your phone we will pay you

50% of its value and 40% after that, till 15 months," said Karan Khara, VP ,

strategic alliances, Snapdeal.



"We won't be offering discounts in the beginning and most of the competition

between e-tailers will take place on the basis of stock availability, delivery

on the day of launch and cashbacks."



Snapdeal has assured delivery on the first day of the phone's India launch to

its prebooked customers who complete payment by 4pm on October 15. Though Khara

did not reveal numbers, it has been learnt that the New Delhi-based online

market



place is eyeing revenues that may run into hundreds of crores from the iPhone

6S.



A relatively new entrant into the e-tailing space, Paytm is looking at a

business of ' 150-200 crore from the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. While Croma, one of

India's largest electronics goods chain, is charging '1,000 for pre-booking the

iPhone 6S, an online shopper can book it on Paytm for '2,000.



Similarly , Bengaluru-based e-tailer Flipkart has gone live with iPhone 6S

pre-bookings from Thursday night.A senior executive from the company said it

will offer a 30-day replacement guarantee on the phones that no other player is

offering
