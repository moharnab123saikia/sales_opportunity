launching its 'Wi-Fi Calling' feature on select handsets, beginning October 8.

The AT&T announcement about the availability of the 'Wi-Fi Calling' feature on
select devices comes close on the heels of the waiver which the carrier has been
granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding teletypewriter
functionality.

According to the announcement made by AT&T, the handsets on which the carrier's
'Wi-Fi Calling' feature is initially available are Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone
6S models. To avail the benefit of the 'Wi-Fi Calling' feature, iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6S users should be on a postpaid rate plan set up with HD Voice support;
and, obviously, on a Wi-Fi connection.

The 'Wi-Fi Calling' feature essentially enables customers to make and receive
phone calls over the data connection - instead of the cellular connection - when
they are on a wireless network and the 'Wi-Fi Calling' option is enabled.

With AT&T having launched the 'Wi-Fi Calling' feature on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S,
customers using the feature will not have to pay any additional charges for
calls placed via Wi-Fi to or from the US, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
Those calls will also not be counted against the calling minutes allotted to the
customers. However, for calls placed to international locations, customers will
have to pay the standard international fees.
