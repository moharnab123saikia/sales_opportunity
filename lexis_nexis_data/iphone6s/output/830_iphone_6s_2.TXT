In a Thursday announcement bigwig US wireless carrier AT&T said that it is

launching its 'Wi-Fi Calling' feature on select handsets, beginning October 8.



The AT&T announcement about the availability of the 'Wi-Fi Calling' feature on

select devices comes close on the heels of the waiver which the carrier has been

granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding teletypewriter

functionality.



According to the announcement made by AT&T, the handsets on which the carrier's

'Wi-Fi Calling' feature is initially available are Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone

6S models. To avail the benefit of the 'Wi-Fi Calling' feature, iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6S users should be on a postpaid rate plan set up with HD Voice support;

and, obviously, on a Wi-Fi connection.



The 'Wi-Fi Calling' feature essentially enables customers to make and receive

phone calls over the data connection - instead of the cellular connection - when

they are on a wireless network and the 'Wi-Fi Calling' option is enabled.



With AT&T having launched the 'Wi-Fi Calling' feature on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S,

customers using the feature will not have to pay any additional charges for

calls placed via Wi-Fi to or from the US, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

Those calls will also not be counted against the calling minutes allotted to the

customers. However, for calls placed to international locations, customers will

have to pay the standard international fees.
