iPhone 6s owners won't care if the iPhone 7 is faster

iPhone 6s users won't care that the iPhone 7 will be much faster. Its A10 SoC

that will power the iPhone 7 will be much faster based on projecting the

Geekbench3 benchmarks of the A10's predecessors by Primate Labs. On average, the

A10 could be 50% faster than the A9. But for most apps, iPhone 6s users won't

perceive the speed.



Benchmarks don't matter, Visual Reaction Time does



Benchmarks like the one run by Primate Labs below are useful for comparing

processors but not application performance. Benchmarks do not account for the

user's interaction with the device. The A10 performance projections were made

based on the average incremental performance improvement of A6 through A9.



How Visual Response Time was measured



YouTube game reviewer Mad Matt TV posted two videos showing speed comparisons

between the iPhone 6 Plus and the iPhone 6s Plus: one that compared the

execution time of various apps, and the other that showed the time for the

fingerprint reader Touch-Id to unlock both devices. There's no question that in

most tests the 6s Plus won, but except for a few apps, users won't perceive the

difference.



The chart at the top of the story compares the difference in load times of the

apps on the iPhone 6s Plus to its predecessor the 6 Plus. The comparison of the

performance of the iPhone 6 and 6s can be expected to be very close. The

difference is measured by comparing the completion times of the app load times

in the videos measured in hundredths of seconds. To give the response times

context , the red line represents the mean visual reaction time (331

milliseconds, or about one-third of a second; 331 milliseconds was cited as the

mean visual reaction time in a paper titled Comparison between Auditory and

Visual Simple Reaction Times in Neuroscience & Medicine.) Visual reaction time

is the time to perceive a visual stimulus and react, which researchers generally

peg at 300 to 500 milliseconds. If you want to explore this idea further, you

can test your visual reaction time on this website.



The performance differences in three apps were below the visual reaction time,

and two more were near the visual reaction time. Only three apps, Apple App

Store, Apple Maps and Angry Birds ran perceptively faster.



With a few exceptions such as high-end games, app developers don't build apps to

take advantage of the fastest, newest phones. Quite the contrary, they optimize

apps to run well on most phones shipped during the last two years. A recent

visit to Facebook's automated mobile testing lab showed how Facebook monitors

and tests new software releases to make sure that performance doesn't become

sluggish or battery draining.

There is too much competition among app developers to let app performance drift

because users will uninstall the offending app and install a better performing

one like it. In most cases, the speed and performance differences between the

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s are barely perceptible. The performance of the iPhone 7

compared to the iPhone 6s will probably be the same, meaning iPhone 6s users

will need other incentives than performance to upgrade.



Apple will need to offer other incentives to motivate iPhone 6s users to upgrade



The iPhone 7, like its predecessors, will be beautifully designed. The new

design and probably a new color will show that a user has bought the newest most

fashionable iPhone. Buying an iPhone 7 is a waste of money for iPhone 6s users

unless they have opted into the one-year upgrade plan when they bought the

iPhone 6s.



On Sept. 7, Apple will tout the A10's feature size shrink to 14-nm, faster clock

rate, and benchmarks, not the barely imperceptible app performance compared to

its predecessor. Apple isn't growing the number of users of its phones, so it

has to convince them to upgrade.
