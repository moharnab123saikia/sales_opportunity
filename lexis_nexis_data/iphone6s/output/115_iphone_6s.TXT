NEW DELHI: Apple has announced that it will launch the new iPhone 6S and iPhone

6S Plus in India on October 16. This will be the fastest iPhone rollout ever for

the Indian market, coming less than a month after the latest models became

available globally.



The October 16 launch puts the new iPhones in position to cash in on the

upcoming festive season. The biggest competitors to the new iPhones in the

Indian market will be Samsung's Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+.



While there is no increment in screen size in iPhone 6S (4.7-inch HD) and iPhone

6S (5.5-inch Full HD) compared to last year's models, they feature a new 3D

Touch display technology, which allows them to differentiate between types of

touches and taps in preloaded apps as well as on the homescreen.



Both iPhones are powered by the new A9 processor with 2GB RAM and run on iOS 9

operating system. They come in 3 storage variants: 16, 64, and 128GB; there is

no support for microSD cards for storage expansions. The rear cameras of the two

smartphones have 12MP resolution, backed by dual-tone dual-LED flash, while the

front cameras have 5MP sensors. Along with the standard silver, space gray and

gold colours, iPhone 6S and 6S Plus also come in a new rose gold hue.



While there is no official word on the pricing, it is expected that iPhone 6S

will be available at starting price of around Rs 60,000, while iPhone 6S Plus

will cost approximately Rs 68,000 for the base variant.
