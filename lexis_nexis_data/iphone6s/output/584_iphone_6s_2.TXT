Sri Lanka, Oct. 5 -- Apple unveiled the latest version of its iPhone line at a

broad-ranging event that also saw the debut of a large-screen iPad, as well as

updates to its Watch and TV products.



iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus



While iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus look very much like the existing versions,

Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, claimed that "we've changed everything about these new

iPhones".



The headline new feature is the addition of pressure sensing to the touch input,

an anticipated feature, although the name - 3D Touch - differs from the Force

Touch used in Apple Watch (it was inadvertently referred to as Force Touch in

the live demonstration).



The new technology detects the intensity of a press, for example enabling users

to peek into email content, or access app features from the icons on the home

screen through pressure-sensing menus.



While Huawei showed-off a similar technology in its new Mate S at IFA 2015 in

Berlin last week, the Chinese vendor is restricting the technology to a single

high-end version, availability of which has not been revealed. Apple,

contrastingly, has deeply integrated it with iOS 9.



"The 3D Touch improvements will give existing iPhone owners an important reason

to upgrade," wrote analyst firm IHS in a research note. "As their existing apps

are updated with 3D Touch, third party app developers will market the

improvements to their apps which will help Apple communicate the benefits of the

iPhone 6S, without Apple having to spend anything on advertising or marketing."



The other big update came in the iPhone's camera capabilities. As expected, the

main (rear) camera has been upgraded to 12MP from 8MP in the previous version

and also gained 4K video capture capabilities.
