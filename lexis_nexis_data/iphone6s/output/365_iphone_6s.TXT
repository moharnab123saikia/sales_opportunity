handsets sold worldwide just three days after its much hyped launch.

The latest must-have smartphones outstripped last year's sales of the iPhone 6
and 6 Plus by three million - and it beat the 5s and 5c by four million.

But savvy phone fans looking for the best deals on the hottest handset of the
year should check our guide before buying - because even the value-formoney
deals can vary by more than £100 over two years.

We teamed up with price comparison website uSwitch to find five of the best
contract offers over two years for the 6s and 6s Plus. The website's telecoms
expert Ernest Doku said: "Choosing the right iPhone 6s deal can be a minefield.

"Some require you to pay a bit towards the handset up front, others absorb the
cost of the phone into your monthly bills.

"The iPhone 6s Plus is no different to the 6s, bar a slightly larger screen.

"If you can live without those extra millimetres you'll make a saving.

"And if you can't afford the iPhone 6s, there are some fantastic deals on older
models, as well as other flagship smartphones, that are cheaper.

"It's well worth checking out the HTC One M9, Samsung Galaxy S6 or S6 Edge and
the LG G4."
