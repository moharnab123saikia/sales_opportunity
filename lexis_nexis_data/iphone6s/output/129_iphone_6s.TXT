Prices have dropped by as much as Rs 25,000 on the grey market, for some models.



We reported last week that despite the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus only being

available on the international market, they were still making their way to the

Indian grey market, for a highly marked up price. Interestingly enough, those

same sellers preempted the launch of Google's new Nexus 5X an 6P smartphones by

dropping that price last night.



You can now buy the iPhone 6s at Rs 65,000 for the 16GB, Rs 75,000 for the 64GB,

and Rs 90,000 for the 128GB, Meanwhile, the iPhone 6s Plus is now available on

the grey market at Rs 90,000 for the 64GB, and Rs 1,10,000 for the 128GB, there

have reportedly been no takers for the 16GB iPhone 6s Plus.



The sellers, it seems, have realised that the popularity of Google's Nexus

series erode the justification for marked up iPhones, as well as the fact the

the iPhone will be available in India Oct 17, starting at Rs 53,500 for the 16GB

iPhone 6s, and Rs 62,500 for the 16GB iPhone 6s Plus.
