According to a 9to5Mac report, Chinese device manufacturer OnePlus - which has

launched three interesting Android-powered handsets thus far - has now created

an accessory for the Apple iPhone.



The report has revealed that the accessory which OnePlus is selling for the

iPhone - the biggest competitor of Android in the smartphone market - is a slick

sandstone case for two models of the handset --- the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S.



The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S cases being sold by OnePlus are priced at $19.99

(15.99). The cases come with the same Sandstone Black finish as one of the most

popular rear panels which is currently available for OnePlus' high-end flagship

handsets -- the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2.



Moreover, the OnePlus case for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S handsets also features the

manufacturer's logo as well as its motto, '#NeverSettle,' which is printed

inside the cases, alongside a "Get a grip" message.



In addition, the iPhone cases being offered by OnePlus also, strangely, come

with a OnePlus physical invite card, which allows buyers to purchase OnePlus'

latest mid-range handset -- the OnePlus X.
