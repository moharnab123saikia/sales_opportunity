launched three interesting Android-powered handsets thus far - has now created
an accessory for the Apple iPhone.

The report has revealed that the accessory which OnePlus is selling for the
iPhone - the biggest competitor of Android in the smartphone market - is a slick
sandstone case for two models of the handset --- the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S cases being sold by OnePlus are priced at $19.99
(15.99). The cases come with the same Sandstone Black finish as one of the most
popular rear panels which is currently available for OnePlus' high-end flagship
handsets -- the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2.

Moreover, the OnePlus case for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S handsets also features the
manufacturer's logo as well as its motto, '#NeverSettle,' which is printed
inside the cases, alongside a "Get a grip" message.

In addition, the iPhone cases being offered by OnePlus also, strangely, come
with a OnePlus physical invite card, which allows buyers to purchase OnePlus'
latest mid-range handset -- the OnePlus X.
