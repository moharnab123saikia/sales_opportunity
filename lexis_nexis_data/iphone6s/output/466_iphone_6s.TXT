The flagship devices Galaxy S7 and S7-EDGE from the world's largest smartphone

manufacturer Samsung are sold in greater quantities than the Apple's iPhone 6S

and 6S-Plus during a three-month period ending in May, a statement said on

Tuesday.



Almost 16 percent of customers preferred a Samsung Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7-Edge

on Apple's iPhone 6S and 6S-Plus and only 14.6 percent people purchased an

iPhone 6S or 6S-Plus during this period.



No doubt, it is a significant achievement for the South Korean smartphone

manufacturer, it said.



Apple's iPhone 6S and 6S-Plus were released in September last year, while the

Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7-EDGE were announced in March this year with exciting

and attractive Virtual Reality offer.
