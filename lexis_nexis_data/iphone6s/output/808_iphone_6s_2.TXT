Gaming on a touchscreen traditionally has limitations -you either use onscreen

buttons or swipes and gestures to control the action. But when you get a screen

that is capable of sensing varying levels of pressure (like the iPhone 6s and 6s

Plus), it opens up some new avenues for developers. This is the first free game

that



takes advantage of 3D Touch on the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus to enable a new control

scheme. It was showcased during the iPhone 6s reveal and developers Pixel Toys

have employed the free-to-play model. Certain items and features within the game

will need to be purchased with real money at a later stage.This is not to say

that the game won't work on older iPhones -it does, but without the pressure

sensing control scheme.



In Freeblade, you take control of a mech -think of it like a heavily-weaponised

suit -to destroy everything in your path. You swipe across the screen to aim and

fire and with 3D Touch, you press harder to fire secondary weapons. At times, it

does seem like everything is on rails (you don't have control over movement

-just aiming and firing) and the camera forces you to look in certain directions

-but the sound effects and 3D rendering make up for this.
