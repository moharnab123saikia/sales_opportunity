Irish Apple fans hoping to get their hands on the new iPhone will be able to do

so next week.



The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which went on sale on September 25th in 12 countries

including the US, UK, China and Australia, will be launched in 40 more markets

on October 9th. Ireland, Mexico, Russia and Spain are among the second tranche

to get the phone, with Apple intending to make the handsets available in more

than 130 countries by the end of the year.



The phone will cost from EUR 759 for the iPhone 6S and EUR 869 for the iPhone 6S

Plus, with 216GB, 64GB and 128GB models available. The Apple Watch arrived in

Ireland last week, several months after its April launch.



Apple said it had sold more than 13 million iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus

handsets within three days of its launch, with chief executive Tim Cook

describing the sales as "phenomenal". They beat all first weekend sales results

in Apple's history.



When the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus debuted last year, the company sold 10 million

iPhones in the first weekend. The new phones' sales figures were given a boost

by China, which wasn't part of the initial release in 2014.
