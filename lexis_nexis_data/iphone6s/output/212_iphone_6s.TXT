NEW DELHI: Apple may make users wait three more months before it takes the

covers off the next-generation iPhone, but fans can take heart as the first

batch of leaked iPhone 6S has surfaced online.



, the images show that iPhone 6S will have the same look as its predecessor,

iPhone 6, down to the dimensions. However, the report says that iPhone 6S Plus

may feature a few changes in design.



Though the design of iPhone 6S does not have any tweaks, it will still come with

a different internal mounting structure for the new logic board and components.



The leaked images shoot down the rumours that said iPhone 6S will be equipped

with a dual-lens rear camera system, since the cut-outs for camera, microphone

and LED flash on the rear casing are the same as the ones seen in iPhone 6.



The antenna lines will still be present on the exterior as on iPhone 6 as well.



Like its predecessor, iPhone 6S will sport the same design at the bottom for the

headphone jack, speaker holes, microphone and Lightening port.
