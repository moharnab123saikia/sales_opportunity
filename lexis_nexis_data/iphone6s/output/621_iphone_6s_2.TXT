Apple on Wednesday unveiled two updated iPhones, aiming to build on the success

of its large-screen handsets introduced late last year.



The new smartphones are the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, keeping the same overall

dimensions of the last version.



"They look familiar, but we have changed everything about these iPhones," chief

executive Tim Cook said at a San Francisco media event.



One of the key new features is called "3D touch" which responds to pressure

exerted on the screen to allow users to look inside messages and applications.



The new iPhones will use the upcoming iOS 9 operating system, which supports new

features such as 3D touch.



The 6S will include the 4.7-inch (about 12-centimeter) display of its

predecessor and the 6S Plus -- one of the more popular handsets in the "phablet

category" -- has a 5.5-inch screen.



But the devices have more powerful processors that allow for improved graphics,

and a new aluminum body.
