iPhone SE features smaller screen, lower price

SMALL, medium or large? You might drive a Toyota Prius, and I might drive a

Chevrolet Silverado. I might like a shot of espresso while you might like a Big

Gulp. Seems like there's a right size for everything-including cell phones.

Apple introduced the original iPhone with a 3.5-inch screen and kept that size

through the iPhone 4S, before screens started getting bigger.



It's just in the last two years that Apple started rolling out two iPhones per

year with differing screen sizes. But those new screen sizes were big and

bigger.



Apple jumped from the 4-inch screen of the iPhone 5S to give customers the

4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.



Just like that, Apple decided iPhone users wanted bigger screens, but did we

really?



I've read that 25 percent of iPhone users did not upgrade to one of the larger

iPhones. Indeed, Apple kept selling the iPhone 5S with its smaller screen and

two-year-old processor as the entry level iPhone, and it was apparently selling

pretty well.



A lot of people I know were not happy that Apple was forcing larger iPhones on

them. I like to keep my phone in my back pocket, and I found the iPhone 6S Plus

just too big. I'm sure people who wear smaller pants than I do have that same

problem.



I also know iPad mini owners who think the larger iPhones are just too close in

size to their iPads.



Plus, a lot of people like using their phone one-handed, and the 6S made that

almost impossible.



Thankfully, Apple decided to listen to the market and introduce the iPhone SE,

which is basically the guts of an iPhone 6S crammed into the case of an iPhone

5S.



THE GOOD STUFF



THE iPhone SE has a lot of features in common with the iPhone 6S, but not

everything.



The SE uses the same processor, the A9, with the same M9 motion coprocessor. The

main camera on the SE is the same .12-megapixel model as in the 6S, and it can

capture 4K HD video.



The SE has a CPU that's twice as fast and graphics performance three times as

fast as the iPhone 5S.



The SE also has Apple Pay, which is missing from the 5S. The faster processor

also allows for Hey, Siri hands-free use.



THE DIFFERENCES



THE insides of the SE have a lot in common with the 6S, but the case and screen

are the same as the 5S.



That means the SE's 4-inch screen has a resolution of 1136 x 640 pixels with a

pixel density of 326 pixels per inch. It uses Apple's first-generation Touch ID

sensor, which is not as fast as the second-generation fingerprint sensor of the

6S.



The fingerprint recognition is still plenty fast, but not lightning-fast like in

the 6S.



THE PRICE DROP



APPLE surprised a lot of people with a low starting price for the SE. There are

two storage configurations-16 gigabytes for $399 and 64 gb for $499. The low

starting price is going to bring a lot of new customers to Apple and, perhaps,

convince a number of iPhone 5 and 5S users to upgrade.



The iPhone 6S starts $250 higher at $649.



There are naysayers who claim Apple is going to eat into its own market share

with the SE, but honestly, while there are some 6S and 6S Plus users who will

jump to a smaller iPhone, I think the people holding onto their 5S handset now

have a good reason to upgrade.



Plus, in markets like China and India, iPhones have been out of reach for a good

chunk of the population. The SE will be popular overseas.



Apple seems to be pretty good at waiting to see what people want and then giving

it to them.



People are fickle. We want bigger phones until it's all we have, and then we

want smaller phones. Now there is a current-generation iPhone for everyone.
