Apple puts big bets on mainland's iPhone mania

Apple is hoping that the mania for iPhones in China never fades. After the

iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were unveiled on September 9, pre-orders were sold

out in China in 12 hours. Chinese Apple fans are as keen on the new toys as they

were on previous models.Apple reported $13.23 billion in revenue for China, its

second largest market, in the last quarter. Amid skepticism about China's

economic downturn, Apple CEO Tim Cook delivered a rare speech to reassure

investors, saying China still "represents an unprecedented opportunity over the

long term."Clearly, Apple needs China more than ever before.



According to Kantar Worldpanel's research this April, the iPhone's market share

has dropped in 17 developed economies. However, China, including Hong Kong,

Macao and Taiwan, was the only territory to show positive growth. After the

launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the iPhone's market share in China surged from

18.1 percent last November to 27.6 percent this February.As China's strong

demand is becoming essential to Apple's prosperity, the company's strategy has

changed substantially. Apple's recent event in San Francisco indicates evident

pandering to the Chinese consumers: For the first time, China was promoted into

the first wave of markets to get the new iPhone; Rose gold, a kind of pink

favored by Asian women, was added to cater to the Chinese demand.But a pandering

strategy doesn't mean Apple is becoming more consumer-friendly, especially in

prices. Being enlisted as a first-wave market cannot lower the prices of iPhone

6s and iPhone 6s Plus in China. There are jokes about how to trade a kidney for

an iPhone in China, a sarcastic way to mock the exorbitant price of the

handset.It is unfair to put all the blame on Apple for iPhone's high prices,

because a large part of the extravagance is caused by external factors, such as

China's heavy tariffs.However, the high prices, combined to some degree with

innovation, give Apple a halo of luxury. China's growing middle class don't find

it unacceptable to spend 5,000 to 7,000 yuan ($784.30 to $1,098.60) on something

regarded as a sign of living a wealthy and stylish life.Many iPhone users in

China will spend a fortune to buy an iPhone, but are unwilling to pay a few yuan

for a useful or interesting app. They, even though not IT geeks, will happily

jailbreak their handsets at some roadside fake "Apple franchised stores," which

will ruin the well-knitted and stable iOS. The iPhone is more related to the

users' sense of status and lifestyle, instead of practical usage.But even though

the iPhone still dominates, we can legitimately wonder how long this

mania-driven prosperity can last. Apple has to realize that its over-dependence

on the iPhone, which contributes two-thirds of its revenue, and its growing

reliance on the Chinese market, which is believed to surpass the Americas sooner

or later, are profitable in the short term, but risky in the long term. Apple

seems to be trapping itself in an "update model," by relying on hardware

upgrades on a yearly basis instead of seeking more eye-catching innovations to

stir more enthusiasm.There are signs indicating Apple is facing more challenges

from competitors in China. In July, German market research agency GfK found

Apple's market share had slightly dropped, while Chinese smartphones, like

Xiaomi and Huawei, are winning more fans. Like the once-ubiquitous Nokia, Apple

may find itself dropped by Chinese when something better comes along. The author
