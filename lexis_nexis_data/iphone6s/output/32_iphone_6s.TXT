Does it make sense to buy the iPhone 6s (128 GB), or spend an equivalent amount

on the iPhone 7 (32 GB)? We try to make the decision easier for you.



Apple has predictably slashed the prices of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus,

just ahead of the launch of its latest smartphones iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus. The

Cupertino-based technology giant has cut prices of the highest storage variant

by Rs 22,000! Now, the iPhone 6s (128 GB) costs Rs 60,000 and the iPhone 6s (32

GB) has priced at Rs 50,000. The prices of iPhone 6s Plus have been cut too,

with the 128 GB variant costing Rs 70,000 and the 32 GB model priced at Rs

60,000.



Apple has also declared the prices of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. While

iPhone 7 starts from Rs 60,000 and goes up to Rs 80,000, the iPhone 7 Plus base

variant costs Rs 72,000 and the prices go up to Rs 92,000. The new phones will

start retailing in India from October 7 onwards. One of the first things that

stand out in the whole price cut move is that now, iPhone 7 base variant and the

iPhone 6s highest storage model cost the same - that is Rs 60,000. So as a

prospective buyer of the iPhone, what should you do? Does it make sense to buy

the iPhone 6s (128 GB), or spend an equivalent amount on the iPhone 7 (32 GB)?

We try to make the decision easier for you by asking a few experts and also

comparing the important specifications of these two models.



Peter Richardson, Research Director, Tech Strategies at Counterpoint Research is

of the view that the iPhone 7 is a better choice. "The reasons are the much more

powerful and energy efficient processor, slightly improved battery performance

and better camera. These are things the consumer will benefit from in daily

use," Richardson told FE Online. "Furthermore the new iPhone 7 is water and dust

resistant, so it will be more resilient in the face of the trials and

tribulations of everyday life. What this means in the longer term is a better

resale value when the consumer comes to sell the device at some point in the

future," he explains. "So, although the starting price is approximately the

same, looking at the lifetime cost of ownership, the iPhone 7 will likely be the

better choice," he adds.



However, Richardson maintains that the iPhone 6s is a "very good product" to

buy. "128GB is a huge amount of storage - more than enough for storing vast

numbers of photos, music files, and even quite a few movies. Until the launch of

iPhone 7, iPhone 6s is the best iPhone available and among the best smartphones

of any type. So even after the launch of iPhone 7, it will remain a very good

product," he says. "However, if the consumer can live with 'only' 32GB storage,

it will likely make more sense to wait a few weeks for the new model," he

concludes.



Jaipal Singh, Market Analyst, Client Devices, IDC India feels that people who

prefer better storage would likely go for the iPhone 6s. "Users who prefer

higher storage in their devices would like to buy the iPhone 6s 128 GB variant

as it has become more affordable. The current price cuts can be seen as an

inventory cleaning exercise from Apple. Price cuts will also create space for

the new versions of iPhones which are going to hit the market in October in the

similar price range," Singh told FE Online. "In India, older versions of iPhones

get higher traction as compared to the latest versions. After a few price cuts

these older versions fall in the budget of many consumers and provide an

opportunity for aspirants to enter into the Apple ecosystem," Singh adds.



While the price cuts normally make the iPhones more 'affordable', this time

round the slightly lower launch prices of the new smartphones have to an extent

reduced that difference. The iPhone 7 is actually launching at a price which is

Rs 2,000 less than the launch price of iPhone 6s! So, in that sense, we would

say that unless your smartphone's storage is a very crucial factor that drives

your purchase decision, it may very well make sense to wait for the new iPhone

7!
