A total of three iPhones incoming next month?

In addition to sporting a Qualcomm LTE modem, it looks like we might be getting

another iPhone 6s next month; one that does not feature a screen of 4.7 inches

or 5.5 inches. Instead, the latest rumor suggests that the upcoming handset is

going to feature a screen size of 5.0 inches. Even with one month remaining for

Apple's highly anticipated smartphone duo, leaks continue to flow.



According to the source that brought up the rumor in the first place, it looks

like we will be bearing witness to more than two iPhone 6s models. As always,

the regular iPhone 6s will have a screen size of 4.7 inches, while its larger

counterpart will have a screen size of 5.5 inches. Interestingly enough, we have

also come across additional information that states that while the resolution of

the 5.0 inch iPhone 6s will be 1080p, it will be sporting a rear camera of 8MP.



The previous report suggests that the upcoming iPhone 6s will have a 12MP rear

camera sensor. Now coming to the rumor at hand, the source reminds us that if we

want to get our hands on a better performing camera sensor, then we are going to

have to spend more money and purchase an iPhone 6s Plus, which has been rumored

to feature a 1440p display.



With a 5.0 inch iPhone 6s sporting a resolution of 1080p, it could mean that the

4.7 inch model could be rendering an even smaller resolution. However, since the

source already indicated that this was just another rumor, we have no choice but

to treat it with the same impression. Both iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are

going to feature 14nm/16nm FinFET chips, so we will be looking forward to the

announcement that Apple is going to make next month.
