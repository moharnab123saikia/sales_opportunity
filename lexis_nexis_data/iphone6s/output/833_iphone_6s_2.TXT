The Mi 5, being ultra-fast and ultra-thin, outperforms Apple's iPhone 6s and

iPhone 6s Plus in several categories, said Lei Jun, founder of Xiaomi, while

revealing the details in a more than one-and-a-half hours launch event in

Beijing.

Speaking of the technology breakthroughs that Barra described as "black magic"

at the event, Hadlee Simons, a South African tech reporter from local news

portal africa.com, said, "The smartphone market is very competitive, vendors

such as LG and Samsung have all brought eye-catching functions in their new

phones that debuted at this year's MWC, and Mi 5 is definitely on that level."

According to Simons, battery life and price are the top two important concerns

for African buyers due to frequent power blackouts and price-sensitiveness in

the local market.



"People were worried that Xiaomi will push up the prices after the launch of its

smartphone product line, but with the Mi 5, the company has still presented an

answer with a competitive price," said Simons. He uses a Mi 4 that he purchased

back in Africa, and is looking forward to seeing Xiaomi's move on the virtual

reality sector.

At the end of last year, Xiaomi partnered with MIA Group (Mobile in Africa), the

local iPhone distributor, to sell its products to South African consumers. The

MIA Group handles local sales, marketing, and support for Xiaomi.



More than 100 reporters, mostly from India, China and European countries

participated in the media preview.



Xiaomi sold 64.9 million smartphones in China last year, taking a market share

of 15 percent, defending its crown as the No 1 seller at its home market,

according to data from research firm International Data Corp.
