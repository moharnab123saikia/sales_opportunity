India, Sept. 15 -- Apple, Inc. is set to shatter last year's record for first

weekend sales of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, when sales broke the 10 million mark

within just three days of its sales launch on September 19, 2014.



"Customer response to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus has been extremely positive

and preorders this weekend were very strong around the world. We are on pace to

beat last year's 10 million unit first-weekend record when the new iPhones go on

sale Sept. 25," the company said.



Last week, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant unveiled its iPhone 6S and

iPhone 6S Plus smartphones with a faster processor, new 3D touch capabilities

and an improved camera.
