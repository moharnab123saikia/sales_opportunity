In what's become something of a head-scratching tradition, Apple's iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6 Plus launch last year was accompanied by a completely overblown scandal
known as 'bendgate.'

If you recall, news stories alleging that the iPhone 6 was prone to bending
seemingly sprouted up out of nowhere last year. And while the story certainly
generated its fair share of press online, the number of actual reported cases of
people bending their iPhones was so small as to be wholly insignificant. But as
tends to be the case, whenever a news story puts Apple in a negative light, the
tech press can't help but run with it and proclaim that Apple has lost its mojo.

In a statement addressing the scandal that truly wasn't, Apple last September
said the following:

Our iPhones are designed, engineered and manufactured to be both beautiful and
sturdy. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus feature a precision engineered unibody
enclosure constructed from machining a custom grade of 6000 series anodized
aluminum, which is tempered for extra strength.

Apple also added that during the first six days of availability, the company
only received 9 complaints regarding bent iPhone models.

Well, with the iPhone 6s launch looming, it appears that Apple has taken steps
to reduce that number to zero.

For starters, we've already seen rumors that Apple with the iPhone 6s has opted
to use 7000 Series aluminum, resulting in a more sturdy construction than what
we saw with the iPhone 6. Simply put, even trying to bend the iPhone 6s on
purpose may be an exercise in futility.

Highlighting this, a recent video purporting to showcase an iPhone 6s metal
casing being put to the test demonstrates just how sturdy Apple's next-gen
iPhone will be. I suppose now the question becomes -- what type of overblown
scandal will we see once the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus launch this September.
