Apple's fall product event is typically all about iPhones, but CEO Tim Cook

waited until three quarters of the way through the Sept. 9 shindig to bring up

the company's popular device.



But when he did finally unveil the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, he got big cheers from

the crowd. "We have changed everything about these new iPhones," he told the

audience.



The next-generation smart phone comes with a new feature called 3D touch which

senses multiple levels of pressure from the finger on the touch pad. This allows

for a function called "peek" where a user can quickly preview information

without having to open up a different app.



It also has capabilities for the new Hey Siri function, which allows a user to

access the voice-activated personal assistant with that phrase. "Siri's

definitely sassy," joked senior vp Phil Schiller when announcing the feature.



A big selling point of the new phone is its upgraded camera, including a 5 mega

pixel front-facing camera for selfies and FaceTime. The iPhone 6s also includes

the ability to shoot in 4K video, although the Apple TV has yet to include

support for the ultra HD video format.



Apple has also unveiled a new technology called Live Photos, which animates

still photos by extending the capture moment by a second-and-a-half on either

end.



The iPhone 6s comes in the standard three colors - silver, gold and space gray -

and in a brand new rose gold color.



New accessories for the iPhone 6s include a charging dock and leather covers.



The 6s will start at $199 with a two-year contract and the 6s Plus will start at

$299 with a two-year contract. Apple has also broken down prices into monthly

installments for people without a contract. A new program called the iPhone

Upgrade Program also allows people to buy a new, unlocked phone every year for

$32 a month.



The iPhone is available to pre-order on Sept. 12 and will ship Sept 25. The new

operating system, iOS 9, comes out on Sept. 16.
