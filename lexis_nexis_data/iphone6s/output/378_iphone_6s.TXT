waited until three quarters of the way through the Sept. 9 shindig to bring up
the company's popular device.

But when he did finally unveil the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, he got big cheers from
the crowd. "We have changed everything about these new iPhones," he told the
audience.

The next-generation smart phone comes with a new feature called 3D touch which
senses multiple levels of pressure from the finger on the touch pad. This allows
for a function called "peek" where a user can quickly preview information
without having to open up a different app.

It also has capabilities for the new Hey Siri function, which allows a user to
access the voice-activated personal assistant with that phrase. "Siri's
definitely sassy," joked senior vp Phil Schiller when announcing the feature.

A big selling point of the new phone is its upgraded camera, including a 5 mega
pixel front-facing camera for selfies and FaceTime. The iPhone 6s also includes
the ability to shoot in 4K video, although the Apple TV has yet to include
support for the ultra HD video format.

Apple has also unveiled a new technology called Live Photos, which animates
still photos by extending the capture moment by a second-and-a-half on either
end.

The iPhone 6s comes in the standard three colors - silver, gold and space gray -
and in a brand new rose gold color.

New accessories for the iPhone 6s include a charging dock and leather covers.

The 6s will start at $199 with a two-year contract and the 6s Plus will start at
$299 with a two-year contract. Apple has also broken down prices into monthly
installments for people without a contract. A new program called the iPhone
Upgrade Program also allows people to buy a new, unlocked phone every year for
$32 a month.

The iPhone is available to pre-order on Sept. 12 and will ship Sept 25. The new
operating system, iOS 9, comes out on Sept. 16.
