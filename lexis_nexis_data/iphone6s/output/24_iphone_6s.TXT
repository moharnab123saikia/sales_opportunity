Bangladesh, Sept. 15 -- In what can surely be termed the biggest price cut ever

by smartphone giant Apple in India, the company has slashed the prices of its

smartphones by as much as Rs 22,000. Apple iPhone 6S (128GB), which carries an

MRP of Rs 82,000 so far, will now be available at an MRP of Rs 60,000 after a

price drop of Rs 22,000.



The bigger-screen variant of iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus (128GB) will now be

available at an MRP of Rs 70,000. The smartphone too has recieved a price cut of

Rs 22,000.



Apple's 4-inch smartphone iPhone SE, launched earlier this year, too has got a

price cut. The 64GB version of iPhone SE, currently sporting a price tag of Rs

49,000 will now be available at Rs 44,000.



The price cuts come as the India launch of the company's latest iPhones --

iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus -- nears. Apple will launch the new iPhones in India

on October 7. Though Apple has not yet officially started the pre-orders for the

two phones, several resellers of the company like IWorld have already started

accepting the pre-bookings for the device.



Apple launched iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in India in October last year.

TheApple iPhone 6s (16GB) launched at a price of Rs 62,000, while iPhone 6s Plus

(16GB) had an MRP of Rs 72,000.



Both the iPhones come with 3D Touch and 2GB RAM. Both iPhone 6s and 6s Plus

sport 12-megapixel iSight camera, capable of shooting 4K videos. The front

FaceTime camera is 5-megapixels.



Both iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus feature faster-second-generation TouchID

sensor and are made of tough aircraft grade aluminium, same as Samsung Galaxy S6

and S6 edge. Under the hood is the new 64-bit A9 chipset that is 70 per cent

faster at carrying out processes than the one seen in iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

Plus. Similarly, the graphics processing too is said to have jumped 90 per cent

aided by a new graphics processor versus previous-generation models, according

to a news agency.
