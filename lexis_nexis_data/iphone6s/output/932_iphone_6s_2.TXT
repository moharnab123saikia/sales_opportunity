Sydney Apple Store queue



Unhinged Apple fans across the world are already queueing up to buy the new

iPhone 6S.



Apple unveiled their new devices at a huge event in California tonight, but they

won't even start taking pre-orders for them until Friday.



And they won't be in stores for at least a week after that.



Some Brits are not so impressed - two in five say they plan to hold off until

the price dives.



France Apple Store queue



But people are already spotting Apple obsessives pitching tents outside the tech

giant's retail stores.



A reporter for tech website CNET tweeted a picture of a tent pitched outside

Apple's Sydney store last night, before the new devices had even been announced.



And it's not the first time this has happened.



Ten days ahead of the release of the iPhone 6 in 2014, people were queueing up

outside Apple's Regent Street store - in the hope they'd be able to sell their

place in line for cash.



The Hungarian national who claimed the first place in the queue last year hoped

to sell it for Â£1,000 to fund a business venture.



Apple used their huge event to unveil two new iPhones, as well as a giant iPad

Pro and a new Apple TV.



The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus follow the company's tradition of releasing a

similarly styled phone every other year, but with upgraded features.



The new range feature a new input method called 3D Touch, which recognises

different levels of pressure on the touch screen.



It also has an upgraded camera and stronger aluminium casing.



Will you buy the new iPhone 6s?
