The new iPhones will land in Israel on October 15. Partner, Cellcom, and

Pelephone have announced the new lineup will be available for sale that same

day. The gadget shops, like iDigital and BUG will also offer the new models.



Consumers who want to guarantee Apple's iPhone 6S or the 6S Plus could pre-order

them starting October 9 from Cellcom. Dynamica Cellular and iDigital will hold a

midnight launch event on October 14.



The new iPhone prices are expected to be similar to last year's models, with NIS

3,700 for the 16 GB iPhone 6 and NIS 4,200 for the Plus.



The price of an iPhone 6S in the US stands at NIS 2,700 (including local

states), while the 6S Plus sells at NIS 3,130.



Same look, new body



The new iPhones look identical to the previous models but are made of a tougher

aluminum, with the same size screen but made with a new hardened glass cover.

The most significant development for the 6S and the 6S Plus is the inclusion of

the 3D Touch technology.



The new tech senses the pressure of the touch and provides a variety of new

features. For example, when pressing on the Mail app, the phone will now give a

preview of an email. Facebook and Instagram will also support 3D Touch with the

former letting users post status updates straight from the home screen.
