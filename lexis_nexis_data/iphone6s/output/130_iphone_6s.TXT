For those not willing to wait, they're already available in India...the new

iPhone 6s models. But the phones won't come with a company guarantee. Barely two

weeks before some of the most sought after smartphones hit retail shops in

India, Apple's latest offerings -iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus -are available on

are backed by an .eBay guarantee.

75,000 and can ship it within a day, ' while one on Quikr.com has put a



. 65,000 tag for the 16 GB variant of ' iPhone 6s Plus.



"There will be no guarantee or warranty on this phone," a seller on Olx.in told

ET. "The phones come from overseas and won't have the standard warranty or

The phones have become available in India five days after the September 25

launch in the US and 11 other countries. The Cupertino-based smartphone maker

said it sold over 13 million iPhone 6s and 6s Plus phones over the first

weekend, a record.

resellers to ensure they receive the best possible customer service and

post-sales experience. We haven't announced the pricing at this point of time,"

the company said.



Sources at Apple said the phones sold on various websites are im ported and

won't have guaran tees. They said buyers would be risking paying all the money

upfront with no guarantee of delivery. OLX did not respond to queries on

listings on their sites.



Quikr said it has a comprehensive policy on its website that outlines the types

of products for which listing or posting of classifieds or information is

prohibited. "We also spend time educating buyers about what to check before

buying the product listed by the seller," Atul Tewari, COO at Quikr, said in an

email.

manufacturer warranty.
