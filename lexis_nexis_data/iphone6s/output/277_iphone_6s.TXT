NEW DELHI: Apple usually releases its flagship smartphone(s) in fall

(September-October), however, thanks to leaks and rumours we get some idea about

the upcoming devices way before the launch.



It's only March but we're already seeing the rumour mill churn out news related

to this year's iPhone(s).



According to a report by Digitimes, Apple will launch three different iPhones -

iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus and a 4-inch screen-equipped device which is currently

being referred to as iPhone 6C. The report cites industry insiders as the source

to inform that Apple is likely to partner Wistron to assemble the iPhone 6C

while the 6S phones will be made by Foxconn and Pegatron.



The report mentions that all phones will feature LTPS panels. Japan Display,

Sharp and LG Display will supply panels for iPhone 6S Plus and iPhone 6C while

the iPhone 6S panels will be sourced from Japan Display and LG.



Further, it adds that the phones will come with Corning Gorilla Glass, the

iPhone 6S/6S Plus will be powered by Apple's new A9 chips and the iPhone 6C will

feature the A8 chip. All new iPhones will have NFC connectivity and fingerprint

scanning capability.



Apple may also use new camera technology embedding an advanced three-sensor

based camera module within the iPhone. The company was recently granted a patent

for a "Digital camera with light splitter."



According to another report citing supply chain sources by Taiwanese website

UDN, Apple will use a two-lens system in the camera of the next-generation

iPhone. The dual lens setup will help the iPhone capture more light, resulting

in better photos. It will also add optical zoom capability to the camera, which

also gives better photos compared to cameras with digital zoom.



The report also said that Apple will use its Force Touch technology in the

upcoming iPhones. This technology, already being used in Apple Watch, will allow

the touchscreen distinguish between light taps and long presses, thus allowing

the users to interact with their iPhones in several new ways. Moreover, the

touch sensors said to be used in the new iPhones can determine the users' blood

pressure and pulse more accurately.
