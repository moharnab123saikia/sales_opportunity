HIGHLIGHT:Â Global pre-orders for the company&#8217;s iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S

Plus are on track to beat last year&#8217;s sales of 10 million new iPhones in

the first weekend last year.





Apple said Monday that global pre-orders for its latest iPhones were on track to

beat last year's sales of 10 million devices in the first weekend, which was a

record for the company.



"Online demand has exceeded our own forecasts for the pre-order period," Trudy

Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said. Ms. Miller said the company was working to

catch up as with demand and that the phones would be available in Apple retail

stores next Friday.



Investor expectations are high for the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, which

were introduced at a huge product release event last week in San Francisco.



After Apple introduced the first iteration of its larger-screen iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus, the company posted an $18 billion profit, the most profitable

quarter ever for a publicly traded company, in its fourth quarter of fiscal

2014.



IPhone pre-orders began over the weekend and the phones go on sale Sept. 25.
