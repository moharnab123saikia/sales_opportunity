New Delhi, April 2 -- Mobile major Apple has slashed prices of its latest iPhone

6s and iPhone 6s Plus by up to 16 percent in India.





 Currently, the price for the iPhone 6s (16 GB variant) is available between

Rs.52,000 and Rs. 55,000.

 The new price tag is expected to draw more customers to purchase the new

devices.

 The company is trying to revive demand for the October-December quarter, which

is said to be the 'strongest period' for Apple due to its flagship launches in

September.

 Recently, Apple had also slashed the price of its bestseller iPhone 5S in

India.

 iPhone 5s are now available in price range of Rs.24,999 upwards, as opposed to

Rs. 44,500 and above in September.
