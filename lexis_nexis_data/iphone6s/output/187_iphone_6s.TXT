New Delhi, Sept. 15 -- In what may prove to be a happy news for iPhone 6s and 6s

Plus lovers, the US tech giant Apple has slashed the prices of these devices by

Rs 22,000, market sources said.





 Apple iPhone 6S (128GB variant) which was earlier priced at Rs 82,000, will now

be available at Rs 60,000 after a price drop of Rs 22,000.

 With the same price cut, the iPhone 6s Plus (128GB variant) will now be

available at 70,000, the sources told IANS, though there was no official

confirmation from Apple.

 Apple's 4-inch smartphone iPhone SE, which was launched in March this year,

also got a price cut. The 64GB version of iPhone SE, available for Rs 49,000,

will now be available at Rs 44,000.

 Recently, Apple's iPhone 6s was rated as the world's top-selling smartphone

model in the second quarter of 2016. The US giant currently accounts for two of

the three top-selling devices shipped worldwide.

 Apple shipped 14.2 million units and accounted for four per cent share of all

smartphones shipped worldwide in second quarter of 2016, said market research

firm Strategy Analytics.

 The Apple iPhone 6 shipped 8.5 million units worldwide for second position and

two per cent marketshare during second quarter of 2016, followed by Samsung

Galaxy S7 edge in third place with 8.3 million and two per cent share.

 Apple launched iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus equipped with 3D Touch technology

in India in October last year.

 Both the smartphones feature 64-bit A9 chipset, 12MP iSight camera and 2GB of

RAM.
