You could land in deep trouble if you walk through the Green Channel with it.

The Mumbai Customs have noticed a massive spurt in smuggled iPhone 6s and iPhone
6s Plus at the airport and, since its launch on September 25, have seized 200
such handsets from foreign returning passengers.

While Apple will officially launch the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in India on
the night of October 15, those returning from abroad have started bringing back
the handsets.

"We seized 200 of the latest iPhone models, valued at Rs 1.23 crore, over the
last week. They were being smuggled into India by fliers from Singapore, Hong
Kong, London, Dubai, etc. We have increased screening of baggage, besides
profiling of passengers," Additional Commissioner, Customs, Milind Lanjewar
said.

Officials warned that if passengers are detected with the handsets after passing
through the Green Channel, they are liable to pay a fine, penalty and duty.
According to Lanjewar, duty will be levied on a single phone as well, since its
value is more than goods allowed under 'free allowance'.

"Technically, passengers have to declare goods above Rs 45,000, but most people
are not aware of this. Duty of 36% is levied on the excess amount," Lanjewar
said, adding that even a single iPhone would have to be declared and the duty
paid.

India prices released by Apple distributor Ingram Micro on Tuesday pegged the
iPhone 6s 16 GB at Rs 62,000, the 64 GB variant at Rs 72,000 and 128 GB version
at Rs 82,000, while the iPhone 6s Plus 16 GB will be priced at Rs 72,000, 64 GB
at Rs 82,000 and 128 GB at Rs 92,000. All the prices, it may be noted, exceed
the permissible free duty limit.

Officials said that passengers are smuggling them in for monetary benefit by
sale through the grey market. "This seizure is not the first. On Sunday, seven
youths who came from Hong Kong and Singapore were detained in Delhi with 182
iPhone 6S and 6S Plus," an official said.

The new iPhone models are presently available across US, UK, Australia, Canada,
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico and
Singapore. Apple has sold over 13 million units of these phones since the
launch.
