WATCH: User views IPhone6s photos and contacts without unlocking phone



LENGTH: 193  words





An Android user has unlocked a newly-discovered trick that enables an iPhone

user to access its photos and contacts list without a passcode or fingerprint.



In a YouTube channel, user Videosdebarraquito uploaded a video on April 4

featuring a step-by-step guide that grants an iPhone 6s or 6s Plus to view the

phone's contact list and photo albums even though the user has no passcode.



First, Siri should be activated, either by using the home button or saying Hello

Siri. Then, ask Siri to search Twitter and if Siri asks you what to search, say

@gmail.com or any username of a Gmail address. Once given a full list of tweets,

find a tweet with a full e-mail address in it and click it. Using the 3D touch

of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, firmly press on the e-mail address until a pop-up

window appears.



Lastly, click Add New Contact / Add to Existing Contact from here, you'll be

able to pick the photo box to view all the photos and contacts on the device.



This glitch is possible when using the 3D touch pop-up feature, thus it is

solely allowed on iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. It is also noted that a number of

trials should be done to conveniently master the glitch.
