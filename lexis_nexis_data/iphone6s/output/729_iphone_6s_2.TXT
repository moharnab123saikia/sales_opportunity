Man plans to sell kidney for iPhone 6s



Many have joked about selling their kidneys for Apple products, but for two

young men in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, it was more than a joke. They actually

contacted an illegal agent to sell their kidneys, reported Modern Express on

Tuesday.



One of the men, surnamed Wu, wanted an iPhone 6s but couldn't afford it. His

friend Huang suggested they sell a kidney each for money.



The two then found an illegal agent on the Internet who asked them to take

medical examinations in a hospital in Nanjing. However, when they arrived on

Sept 12, the agent didn't appear as scheduled.



After calming down later that day, Wu reconsidered selling his organ. He told

his friend to stop the plan but Huang wouldn't listen. Wu then called the police

but Huang ran away and has been out of reach ever since.



Next up, a Rolls-Royce driver decides to pardon a driver who hit his car.

insurance company.
