Looking at Apple's new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus might not look different

from iPhone 6 or other Apple's iPhone variants. But, the newest device has

unique gesture detection capabilities that are powered by '3D-Touch' technology

and which open up a new way to unlock shortcuts and give commands.



The new iPhones have been featured with a 12-megapixel iSight camera and can

record 4K HD video for the first time. The new iPhones have 50% more pixels

compared to its predecessors and can take larger panorama photos. No change in

the size of the new iphones has been done but a new kind of 'strongest' glass on

the screen has been introduced by the Company.



Phil Schiller, Apple vice president, claimed that the iPhone users can take

videos with better resolution. There is a new 5-megapixel FaceTime HD camera

inbuilt in new iPhones that can take more detailed photos. Schiller said that

the flash on the camera offers TrueTone lighting, which matches the light with

the ambient lighting. Most interesting feature in the new iPhones is of 'Live

Photos' that allows details in the photos to move like moving waterfall with the

sound of rushing water.



Now comes the talk of price of these iPhones for which you all will be waiting,

the cost of 16GB iPhone 6s has been set $199 whereas the cost of 64GB and 128 GB

iPhone 6s has been set as $299 and $399. The cost of 16GB, 64 GB and 128 GB

iPhone 6s Plus has been set as $299, $399 and $499. A new iPhone upgrade program

has been introduced by the Company which allows its customers to pay $32 per

month till the release of a new iPhone and then customer can return its old

device to the Company.



Along with the release of two new iPhones, the Company also released Giant iPad

Pro, Apple Pencil, New Apple TV at 2015 Special Event.
