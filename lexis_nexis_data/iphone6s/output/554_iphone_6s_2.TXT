In today's trending, sperm banks advertise for donations with iPhone 6s as lure,

man invents hair-washing machine, giant 8-ton tofu unveiled, and drones ensure

delivery within an hour of purchase.



Donate sperm instead of a kidney for an iPhone 6s



The joke goes that some Chinese people would , but perhaps something less costly

- sperm - might get you one too. A sperm bank in Central China's Hubei province

said it would reward donors with an iPhone 6s on its official WeChat account on

Sept 14, Changjiang Times reported.



By 5:00pm on Monday, the WeChat message had been read 1,379 times. Two more

sperm banks in Shanghai also posted similar advertisements in the following

days, read over 400,000 times. However, the report did not say how many men had

actually provided sperm donations after reading the WeChat posts.



"We are looking for donors aged between 22 to 45. 5,000 yuan ($785) will be paid

for 40 ml sample of semen(the iPhone 6s is priced at 5,288 yuan on the

mainland)," the Hubei Human Sperm Bank posted beneath a photo of an iPhone 6s.

The social media posts have stirred controversy, with some saying sperm donation

is a public welfare undertaking which should not be motivated by commercial

gain, while others think it was a good way to encourage more to donate.



The recruitment of sperm donors has been difficult, said Doctor Zhu, with the

Hubei Sperm Bank, as sperm banks are not allowed to advertise on social media.



China has strict rules on the founding and managing of sperm banks, allowing

only one in each province. Lack of sperm donations has been a major issue at all

18 centers nationwide.
