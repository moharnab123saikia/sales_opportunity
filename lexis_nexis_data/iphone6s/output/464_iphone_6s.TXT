Here's a few of the updates you can see in the new iPhone to be announced on

September 9.



Apple will be unveiling their latest iPhone on September 9, and rumours abound

as to what the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will be packing.



Various reports are saying the iPhone will  have an upgraded rear camera for the

first time since the iPhone 4S. Reportedly, the new iPhone will have a 12MP rear

shooter. It's also likely the front camera will get it's own LED flash, as well

as the rumoured addition of a panorama and slow-mo mode. It's also expected to

have 1080p recording. One absolute surety though, is that the new iPhone will

have 3D Force Touch, a modified version of the technology just recently

introduced into Apple's latest Macbook model and the Apple Watch.  It's a

pressure-sensitive touch sensor that can differentiate between a tap, a press,

and a deep press.



Aside from all that, the new iPhone 6S is expected to have 2GB RAM instead of

the standard 1GB, added NFC support, and 4G capability. The addition of Force

Touch also accounts for what sources have reported will be an added 0.2mm tin

thickness. Luckily, that means existing phone cases should still fit.
