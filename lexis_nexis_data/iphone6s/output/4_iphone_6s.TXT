Apple has unveiled the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus - described by CEO Tim Cook

as the "most advanced phones ever" - at a special event in San Francisco on

Wednesday. Pre-orders for the new iPhone models begin this Saturday and they

have a launch date (start shipping) in twelve countries on September 25.



The price for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus remain unchanged compared to

their predecessors: $649 for the 16GB iPhone 6s, $749 for the 64GB iPhone 6s and

16GB iPhone 6s Plus, $849 for 128GB iPhone 6s and 64GB iPhone 6s Plus, and $949

for the 128GB iPhone 6s Plus (all US prices). There's no word yet on India price

or launch date.



The new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus come in four colours: Silver, Gold, Space

Grey, and a new Rose Gold Aluminium finish, made from a custom alloy designed by

Apple. The regions where the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be available at

launch are: Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New

Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, the UK and the US.



The phones come with new 3D touch, which is a pressure sensitive screen that

lets you perform different actions dependent on the amount of pressure you put.

For example, you can light press to preview content, while tap normally to go

view it as usual. Or you can 3D Touch the Facebook icon on your home screen and

post an update without having to open an app.
