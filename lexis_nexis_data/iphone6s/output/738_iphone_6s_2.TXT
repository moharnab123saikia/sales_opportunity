Apple's iPhone, just short of 10 years old, has hit puberty.



Like adolescents coping with awkward changes to their bodies, the iPhone 7, due

for release on Friday, introduces some uncomfortable transitions. They include

the much ballyhooed removal of the headphone jack and the replacement of the

physical home button with a virtual one.



For Apple customers, this creates a difficult choice. While upgrading iPhones in

the past was typically a no-brainer, now people must wrestle with whether to

deal with the hassle of having no audio jack. Many people could simply upgrade

to last year's model, the iPhone 6S, which is also a fast phone with great

cameras and still has the jack.



Yet after testing the new iPhone 7 and its larger sibling, the 7 Plus, for five

days, I have hopped on the 7 train. While it is irritating not to have an audio

jack -- Apple nixed the 3.5 millimeter port to make room for faster chips,

better batteries and to make the iPhone water-resistant -- and the older

physical home button feels better to press than the new virtual one, the new

iPhones deliver on Apple's promises.



The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are tremendously fast -- more than double the speed of

the two-year-old iPhone 6 -- and their cameras produce superb, vivid photos. The

battery life is improved, and the iPhones survived water torture tests.



And after a while, I didn't miss the headphone jack as much as I thought. Apple

is pushing people toward wireless earphones with the introduction of AirPods,

its first wireless earbuds, which I tried. I found AirPods to be a decent first

attempt at wireless audio, though there were glitches.



The bottom line: Those who have been waiting years to buy a new phone are in

store for a major upgrade with the iPhone 7.



Why you don't need a jack



When rumors surfaced about the iPhone 7, they centered on Apple's omission of

the decades-old headphone jack, one of the longest surviving technology

standards. The now-discontinued port let consumers plug many accessories in,

including speakers, earphones and credit card readers. Now the new iPhones have

only one port for hooking up accessories: Apple's proprietary Lightning

connector that was traditionally used for charging the iPhone's battery.



Apple understood that parting with the audio jack would be painful. So it made

two moves:



1) The new iPhones include a converter, or a dongle with a Lightning connector

on one side, for plugging into the iPhone, and an audio port on the other end,

for plugging in an audio accessory.



2) Also included in the box: A pair of wired earbuds with a Lightning connector.



For iPhone owners who relied on Apple's included earbuds, the Lightning earbuds

solve that problem. But for consumers hoarding lots of wired audio gear, the

converter solution is less convenient since the adapter is tiny and easy to

lose. If you have a pair of great wired headphones, your best bet is to leave

the converter connected to the headphones so you don't forget it.



The most convenient workaround to not having a headphone jack is to make the

leap to wireless earphones. Apple's wireless AirPods, due for release in

October, cost $159 and come in a box that resembles a dental-floss dispenser.

They connect to the iPhone's Bluetooth connection via a proprietary chip in the

earphones, called W1.



This makes setting AirPods up extremely easy: When you open the box next to the

iPhone, the earphones automatically pair with the device. (The box also charges

AirPods.) From there, you simply put the earphones on and start listening to

music or podcasts; removing the earphones causes the audio to pause.



Here is where AirPods fell short for me: Sometimes when listening to podcasts, a

glitch caused the podcasts to rewind and replay a small segment -- an eerie

echo. In addition, when using AirPods outside, there was occasional

interference, causing the audio to crackle and cut out.



An Apple spokeswoman said the company was looking into the podcast issue, adding

that the AirPods I tested were early hardware and that bugs should be resolved

by the time they are released next month.



Over all, AirPods sound decent, with loud bass and clear audio quality,

comparable to the wired earbuds that Apple has included in iPhones for years.

They aren't, however, sufficient for drowning out the thunderous prattle of a

loud co-worker.



While AirPods do a good job staying in your ears, they look odd, like dangling

short white stubs. They evoked mockery from one of my editors, who said,

''Cigarettes belong in your mouth, not your ears, Brian.''



I recommend waiting for Apple to fix the issues with AirPods before considering

them. Meanwhile, there are plenty of great Bluetooth headphones. My favorite is

Bose's QuietComfort 35, a pair of fantastic wireless noise-canceling headphones.



Speed, cameras and durability



The most compelling improvement on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is the sharp speed

increase. Spurred by faster chips, everything -- switching between apps, opening

the camera -- feels snappier. The iPhone 7 battery also gets about two hours

more juice than the 6S.



Using the app Geekbench 4, I tested the speeds of the iPhone 7, 6S and 6. The

iPhone 7 was 39 percent faster than the 6S and 114 percent faster than the 6. So

people who bought the 6S last year can probably skip upgrading to the 7, but

those holding onto a 6 and anything older will benefit from a tremendous

performance gain.



Apple also improved the iPhone cameras. Like the 6S devices, the iPhone 7

devices carry 12-megapixel sensors. The difference is that both the new iPhones

include optical image stabilization, a feature that helps photos remain clear

even when your hands are shaky. The larger model, the 7 Plus, also includes a

second camera on the back. The two cameras work together to show the photo's

main subject clearly while gently blurring the background.



In my tests comparing photos taken with the iPhone 6S, 7 and 7 Plus, as well as

a competitor, Samsung's Galaxy S7, photos taken with the 7 Plus had noticeably

better detail when reviewed on a large computer monitor. But when reviewing

photos taken with each camera side by side on a smaller smartphone screen, the

differences were negligible.



So while the new iPhones have great cameras, I wouldn't let that drive your

buying decision. If you prefer a larger screen for reading and watching videos,

consider the 7 Plus, but if you prefer something easier to carry in a pocket and

type on using one hand, go for the 7. (The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch screen; the 7

Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.)



Lastly, Apple made changes to the new iPhones to improve durability. The iPhones

are designed to be water-resistant. In my tests, they survived a swim in a water

pitcher. The physical home button was replaced with a force-sensitive virtual

one. It remains to be seen if the new home button will be more durable. In the

past, one of the first components to wear out on older iPhones was the home

button.



Bottom Line



There are two types of tech consumers: Those who upgrade on a fairly regular

cycle (about every two years with smartphones) to embrace new technology, and

those who upgrade only when they feel they need to.



If you're in the former camp and own an iPhone that is at least two years old,

the decision is obvious: The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are great upgrades. But if you

just bought the iPhone 6S last year, the improvements will be incremental, and

you may want to save your money for the next iPhone.



If you're in the latter group, it's a tougher question. If you have, say, the

four-year-old iPhone 5, you will see a great improvement with an iPhone 6S or a

7. Your decision may come down to how much the lack of a headphone jack and

physical home button bothers you. Audiophiles with lots of wired accessories,

for example, may find using a converter too inconvenient.



But taking the leap to the 7 may be a wise bet, even for late technology

adopters. Apple is likely to continue making iPhones without headphone jacks,

and next year's iPhone will have a full-screen face with the virtual button

built directly into the screen, according to two people at the company who spoke

on condition of anonymity because the product details are private. Apple

declined to comment on next year's iPhones.



To compete with Apple, rivals may also eliminate the audio jack to make room for

faster processors, better batteries and more durable parts. (A little-known

fact: Lenovo beat Apple to removing the audio jack in its new smartphone, Moto

Z, released this year.)



Sooner or later, consumers will probably look back at the iPhone's puberty phase

and accept that changes had to be made for the smartphone to mature. I, for one,

am looking forward to a future with fewer wires.
