said that it will offer Apple iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus smartphones on
Friday, October 16 at over 2,500 retail locations in more than 80 cities across
the country.

Ingram Micro's trade partners would be organizing the launch events across India
on October 16.

ET on Monday reported that Apple has informed its trade partners and top
retailers in India that the company will undertake a big midnight launch of the
new iPhones on October 16th, with an aim to grow sales by 50-60 per cent over
what it had sold in India during last year's launch phase.

With October 16 launch, Apple has shortened the time to market to three weeks of
its US launch as compared to a month and more in previous years. Last year,
Apple had launched its latest flagship smartphones after a month of its US
launch.

This year, Apple started selling the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models in the US
from September 25. The company on Monday also announced a new record after
having sold more than 13 million handsets in just three days after launch.

While Apple is yet to announce the price of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in India, as
per trade estimates the 16GB iPhone 6s will be priced at around Rs 55,000-56,000
while the iPhone 6s Plus 16 GB model will be sold at around Rs 65,000-66,000.
The prices will be much higher for the 64 GB and 128 GB models.
