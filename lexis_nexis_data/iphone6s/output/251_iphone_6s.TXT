T-Mobile has made an announcement that it is going to take a new initiative to

sell Apple's latest iPhone 6s and 6s Plus smartphones for just $5 per month in

case customers trade in eligible late-model smartphones.



Previously in September, T-Mobile declared a special $20 per month rate for a

year and 6 months for a 16GB iPhone 6s via the Jump On Demand program of the

company, with zero down.



But, now T-Mobile is about to bring down its prices even more, with a rate of $5

a month if a customer trades in a working and intact Apple iPhone 6 or 6 Plus,

Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge or a Galaxy Note 5

smartphone. For the deal no down payment is needed.



As a part of the new promotion, in case customers trade in an iPhone 5s or a

Samsung Note 4 or Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone on a 16GB iPhone 6s, they will

have to pay $10 per month for 18 months. If customers trade in almost any other

mobile set, the rate will be $15 per month.



Besides this, T-Mobile customers can also get larger capacity iPhone 6s and

iPhone 6s Plus models under the lower-priced Jump On Demand offerings.



A 128GB iPhone 6s will be sold for $199.99 down and $3 per month along with a

trade-in of an Apple iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, Galaxy S6, Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+,

Galaxy S6 Edge or a Galaxy Note 5 smartphone. It can be done for $8 per month

with the trade of an iPhone 5s or a Samsung Note 4 or Samsung Galaxy S5

smartphone. The rate would be $13 a month on the trade of almost any other

phone.
