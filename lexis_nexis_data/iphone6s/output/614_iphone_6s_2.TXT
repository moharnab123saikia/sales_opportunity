Brianna Lempesis operated a robot from San Diego to virtually wait in line to

purchase a new iPhone 6s at the Apple store in Palo Alto on Friday. And she/it

got one.



"I'm in line like everybody else, I just have a different body," Lempesis told

ABC-7 News . "I am number 15 in line. Some people have left chairs here and

they're not really here, so I feel like I'm being really fair by being here and

I'm committed to being here the entire time."



Lempesis and her robot were among thousands of people (we're pretty sure the

rest were people) around the world to line up to be among the first to buy

Apple's latest smartphones , the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, which went on

sale Friday.
