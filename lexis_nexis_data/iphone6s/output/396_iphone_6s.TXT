two months after their launch in India to boost flag ging sales in what is
histori cally its most crucial quarter as demand for the flagship de vices
nosedived from a Diwali high.

The price of the iPhone 6s 16 GB model, which was introduced at '. 62,000 on
October 16, has fallen by 11-16% and now ranges between ' . 55,000, accord
52,000 and ' ing to four large retailers who spoke to ET on condition of
anonymity . The price cuts are across all variants \xAD 16 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB
-of

both models. The average difference in prices of all iPhone 6s and 6s Plus
devices between launch time and now is about 15%, a top executive at a national
retailer said.

The reduction also narrows the gap with prices of iPhone 6 devices launched in
2014, making an upgrade more attractive for customers."The price difference
between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s was a lot, so many customers are

not willing to upgrade to the new model," said a senior ex ecutive of another
national retailer.

This is the first time that the price of an Apple flagship has been brought down
within two months of launch, underlin ng concerns around the ini ial pricing,
said Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Coun erpoint Technology Market Research.
Apple declined to comment on the matter.
