Apple engineers might oppose government's pressure to crack the iPhone and may

quit: Report

The issue between the Federal Government and technology major Apple to create

software to unlock the iPhone 5c of San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook

has not come to an end. In fact, The New York Times has unveiled that Apple

engineers would prefer to quit rather than cracking Apple's iPhone for security

agencies.



The US government has requested Apple to develop a 'GovtOS' to unlock Farook's

iPhone, but Apple has refused to do so. Former Apple engineering manager

Jean-Louis Gassee said that Apple has an independent culture and a rebellious

one. The company would not come under government pressure and will fight for

rights of users.



If the government aims to force the company to get something out of Apple

engineers, they would not mind quitting, added Gassee.



Window Snyder, former senior product manager for Apple's security and privacy

division, affirmed, "If someone attempts to force them to work on something

that's outside their personal values, they can expect to find a position that's

a better fit somewhere else".



Another important point is that the development teams are isolated from one

another. It is only when a product launch approaches and the different sections

come together to ensure everything is perfect in that product.



As per New York Times report, currently there is no team, which is needed to

develop the software. In that situation, any collaboration would be a difficult

knowing the working culture at Apple. It has to be seen what Apple will do to

stand by with its decision.



May be, it will pay daily penalties. Apple is one of the biggest companies in

the world and what happens in the legal suit has to be seen. Apple is fighting a

court order received by the Federal Bureau of Investigation requiring the

company to develop new software to disable passcode protection and allow access

to the phone of Farook. Justice department said that it will respond to Apple

complaint in the court.



A report published in the Mashable News said, "That will likely be the headline

following the March 21 product event at its headquarters in Cupertino,

California. The widely anticipated 4-inch iPhone (possibly called the iPhone SE,

though iPhone 6C and iPhone 5SE are in contention) will probably not move the

bar on innovation. Instead, it will ensure that the company ably fills the

"small and affordable" smartphone check box."



If you're wondering who wants a 4-inch iPhone when there are some excellent

(albeit larger) choices like the 6S and 6S Plus, just look around at all those

still clutching an iPhone 5, 5s or 5C. You may even spot a few iPhone 4 and 4S

owners, too. They've been itching to upgrade but have little interest in a phone

that might feel too large for their hands or pockets.



"In just a few short days, Apple is going to take the wraps off of its first

brand new iPhone of the year. It won't be the iPhone 7. In fact, it won't be all

that "brand new" either. Instead, the iPhone SE is expected to essentially be an

iPhone 6 with a 4-inch screen wrapped in a housing that looks similar to the

iPhone 5," according to a news report published by BGR News.



We don't yet know how big Apple's new iPhones will be or if the displays will be

the same size and resolution as the current models, but we do know that the new

phones are going to be thinner than the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Way back even

before the iPhone 6s was unveiled, the world's most accurate Apple insider had

some details to share about the iPhone 7.



In a report published by the HoustonChronicle, "Apple employees are discussing

what they will do if ordered to help law enforcement authorities. Some say they

may balk at the work, while others may even quit their high-paying jobs rather

than undermine the security of the software they have created, according to more

than a half-dozen current and former Apple employees."



"Such conscription is fundamentally offensive to Apple's core principles and

would pose a severe threat to the autonomy of Apple and its engineers," Apple's

lawyers wrote in the company's final brief to the U.S. District Court for the

Central District of California.



"It's an independent culture and a rebellious one," said Jean-Louis Gassee, a

venture capitalist who was once an engineering manager at Apple. "If the

government tries to compel testimony or action from these engineers, good luck

with that."
