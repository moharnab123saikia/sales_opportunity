We have already reviewed Apple's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and we have tell

you that there is so much technology present in these devices, it makes us

wonder what is going to be present inside iPhone 7. Before we ponder over that

for a moment, let us take a look at the chipset manufacturing industry. Apple

previously appointed both TSMC and Samsung to mass produce the company's A9

chipset which powers iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, but it looks like the tech

giant is going to be changing its stance on which company is going to mass

produce the next-generation SoC present inside iPhone 7, which is going to be

called A10.



It looks like the sole manufacturer of Apple A10 is going to be none other than

TSMC. TSMC has been battling it out against Samsung on who will be able to

produce the first successful yield of the 10nm FinFET process and it looks like

the Taiwanese semiconductor firm will be getting 100 percent of all orders from

Apple. The 10nm FinFET A10 will promise better performance, not to mention

better efficiency, which is something that we obviously expected with an

incoming smartphone. iPhone 7 is expected to be announced during the month of

September, and alongside it, we should expect its larger screen brother, iPhone

7 Plus.



iPhone 7 Plus has been rumored to sport a 3,100mAh and 256GB of internal

storage, so while the smaller iPhone might not be able to feature a larger

capacity due to its smaller form factor, we are hoping that Apple increases the

maximum amount of internal storage. This could also mean that we could be seeing

the end of the 16GB models, but do not count on Apple to make your dreams come

true this instantly. Also, we did read about how Apple added a layer of rubber

inside its current iPhones, meaning that iPhone 7 and its larger screen

counterpart could be completely waterproof up to a certain depth when submerged

in water.



Apple also filed a camera patent, suggesting that iPhone 7 could sport a

dual-camera setup. While all of these things sounds very exciting, we have to

keep in mind that we should not exceed our expectations of what to see from the

upcoming iPhone duo. As always, we will continue to keep you updated with the

latest updates regarding the upcoming iPhones, and during the month of

September, we should have the latest specification round-off for you guys.
