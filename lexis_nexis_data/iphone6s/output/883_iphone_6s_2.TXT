APPLE has announced updates to its smartphones, iPad and digital set-top box,

the Apple TV, at an event in California on Wednesday (US time), presented by

Apple chief executive Tim Cook. As expected, Apple showcased the iPhone 6s and

iPhone 6s Plus, which visually resemble their predecessors but have improved

cameras, processors and a new feature called "3D Touch" which reads different

levels of screen-touch pressure to give extra functionality.



The low Australian dollar means the new iPhones will cost more than last year's

bestselling iPhone 6 models, ranging from $1079 for a 16GB iPhone 6s to $1529

for a 128GB iPhone 6s Plus.



The handsets will be available in Australia on September 25, with pre-orders

starting this Saturday.



They will arrive with the latest Apple mobile operating system, iOS 9, which

will also be rolled out as an update to existing iPhone and iPad models.The

revamp to Apple TV brings a new operating system, tvOS, which integrates with

Apple's voice-activated personal digital assistant, Siri.



Apple also revealed a new 12.9-inch iPad at the event, the iPad Pro, which it

says is up to 1.8 times faster than previous models and has 10 hours of battery

life. with agencies
