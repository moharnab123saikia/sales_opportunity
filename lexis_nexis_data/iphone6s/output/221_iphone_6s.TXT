

APPLE has sold more than 13 million new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus smartphones in the
first three days of sale, the technology giant has announced.

The figure is a new record for Apple, having previously sold 10m of the iPhone 6
and 6 Plus when it went on sale last year.

The new 6s model, which costs around £460, has a better camera, faster processor
and a pressure-sensitive screen for the first time.

Queues formed outside Apple Stores around the world when the new phones went on
sale on Friday.

The company's chief executive Tim Cook said of the figures: "Sales for iPhone 6s
and iPhone 6s Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any previous first weekend
sales results in Apple's history.

"Customers' feedback is incredible and they are loving 3D Touch and Live Photos,
and we can't wait to bring iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to customers in even
more countries on October 9."

Following the launch of the iPhone 6 last year, Apple went on to sell more than
70m units in three months, and post the largest ever quarterly profit by a
public company in history of £11.8billion.

There had been suggestions that given the huge sales last year, and the modest
upgrades on the device that demand could drop, however the addition of China as
a launch day country for the first time is likely to have boosted demand once
again.

Apple confirmed the new iPhones will also launch in 40 more countries on October
9, and reach 130 countries by the end of the year.
