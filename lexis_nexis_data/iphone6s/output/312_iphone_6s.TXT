iPhone SE vs iPhone 6s: 7 things to know before you decide to make a purchase

By Mohammad Omer -



iPhone SE is a clear example of how smaller size smartphones can pack a lot of

firepower to rival that of phablets. With the 4 inch handset, Apple has made

smaller devices relevant and in more than just one way, and iPhone SE is easily

able to take on its larger sized brother, iPhone 6s. The 4.7 inch handset does

deliver a lot of features, but when you have a choice to make between the two,

there is a lot that you are unaware of and we will help you to make that

decision extremely simple, so let us get started.



That is correct; if you are looking for performance from a compact handset, then

look no further than an iPhone SE. It packs the same hardware as an iPhone 6s,

because the insides comprise of Apple's A9 SoC, which features a dual-core 1.84

GHz Twister processor designed by the company itself, along with a PowerVR

GT7600 GPU. In addition, 2GB of LPDDR4 RAM is more than enough to help you

engage in multitasking options. If you are looking for another reason to go for

an iPhone SE despite its smaller screen, you will find that reason posted below.



Apple's smartphones have not gone beyond past the 1080p mark, and looking at

Sony's Xperia Z5 Premium (the first smartphone to sport a 4K display), handsets

coming with a 4K resolution are going to become relatively common in the future,

if manufacturers are able to solve the issue of battery life. With Apple's

iPhone 6s, the smartphone rocks a 1334 by 750 resolution, whereas an iPhone SE

sports a 1136 by 640 resolution. Smaller resolutions consume less power,

resulting in better battery life, not to mention better graphics performance

(the GPU and CPU pushes less number of pixels on the screen).



In fact, Apple has also listed specifications of the iPhone SE's battery life as

being higher than that of iPhone 6s, depending on what sort of activity you will

be carrying out on your smartphones. The lists have been given below:



Audio: 50 hours



Video: 13 hours



Wi-Fi: 13 hours



LTE: 13 hours



3G browsing: 12 hours



3G (talk time hours): 14 hours



Audio: 50 hours



Video: 11 hours



Wi-Fi: 11 hours



LTE: 10 hours



3G browsing: 10 hours



3G (talk time hours): 14 hours



If you have absolutely no issues in using a 4 inch smartphone as your daily

driver, you will be happy to know that you experience more battery life and rake

out more performance from it.



It's hard to believe that smaller inched smartphones sport camera sensors that

capture images and footage of equivalent quality than those that feature larger

screens. However, in addition to better performance and increased battery life,

iPhone SE is also incorporated with a 12MP rear camera. Smaller number of

megapixels is not necessarily a bad thing, since more light is able to enter per

pixel, resulting in better images in low-light environments.



One huge reason to invest in an iPhone SE is that it able to record 4K video at

30fps, being equal to iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Additionally, if you want to

conserve space and edit slow motion videos, this camera sensor will be able to

do just that thanks to recording in the following resolutions and framerate:



The rear sensor might not produce images sharper than 16MP sensors, but as more

and more camera sensors are succeeding their previous versions, its more about

the quality of the tech, and less about the number of megapixels crammed into

it. Additionally, if you're a selfie buff, then you will love this new feature;

according to Apple, the display of iPhone SE increases to three times its

default brightness in order to capture a high quality selfie without

compromising the image quality. Front flash features are present in some

smartphones, but in low-light, then up end tarnishing the image far more than

actually contributing to its quality.



With all the tech present on the camera side of things, it is pretty evident

that there is no downside to using both cameras on iPhone SE right? Wrong; the

smartphone might be impressive in several ways but the one downside to using it

is the front camera, and that will be because of the lack of megapixels. With a

maximum resolution of 1.2MP, iPhone 6s and 6s Plus definitely win in this

category because they have an impressive 5MP camera. However, one little

difference will obviously not force you to deviate from your purchase, so let us

dive into more features before ultimately reaching our decision.



Yes, that is correct, iPhone SE only comes in the 16 and 64GB capacity models.

64GB is definitely the sweet spot for any handset right now and it is definitely

more than enough for you to carry around your entire media collection with you.

Unfortunately, there are consumers whose collections exceed this limit as well,

requiring them to go for a storage model upgrade. However, we are under the

assumption that those numbers are going to be extremely minute in number.



Apple's proprietary Touch ID fingerprint scanner is integrated into the home

button of iPhone SE, but if you want to experience the same speed recognition

found in iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, you will be fresh out of luck. This smartphone's

Touch ID is the same one present in iPhone 5s, showing that Apple did make a few

sacrifices along the way. According to Pocketnow, a specification breakdown let

the staff to conclude that the fingerprint scanner is comprised up of older

hardware. However, if you do not have a problem with the amount of time it takes

to deduce your identity, then we strongly suggest that you invest in this

device.



Also known as Force Touch, a feature found in iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, Apple

Watch and the 2015 12 inch MacBook, this display is not present in iPhone SE.

While it is definitely a handy addition of playing around with and fire up

commands that give you access to more functions by just putting a slight amount

of force on the screen. It is still rather new, meaning that developers will

probably be finding much better use of the technology with their applications in

the near future, which will be some time from now.



Naturally, as more and more Android smartphones are released boasting this

feature, it will compel developers to branch out more functions in their apps.

As of right now, even if iPhone SE does not have a pressure sensitive display,

do not be too upset about; chances are you will probably forget about such a

thing as soon as you make your purchase.



Contactless payments have become possible through our smartphones thanks to

Apple and the incorporation of NFC chips inside its mobile devices. While NFC

cannot be used to transfer data across device of an iPhone SE (or any other

iPhone for that matter), you can still use Apple Pay to make purchases without

using your payment card.



In many ways, using NFC based payment techniques is definitely safer than

resorting to use your debit or credit card since the information does not stay

on the 'point of sale's' server, meaning that the threat of having a hacker

steal your card details is severely reduced ('point of sale' is a hub where your

payment card is swiped in order to complete the transaction). The only drawback

to using NFC based payments is that there are limited merchants that are

accepting transactions through this channel, but this will obviously take time

to be embraced.



Right now, there is no such thing as a perfect smartphone, and despite iPhone

SE's impressive hardware, it does come short on a lot things, which have been

listed below. To sum up everything, we have stated below the reasons why you

should and you should not invest in an iPhone SE.



Overall, iPhone SE is practically an iPhone 6s, with one major difference

(screen size) and a few minor ones. However, you definitely cannot ignore that

price tag and looking at Apple, it is quite hard to believe that a 4 inch

powerhouse of an iPhone can cost you just $399 (for the 16GB model). As we

conclude this, we have to say that in a world littered with phablets, Apple has

definitely given us more than our fair share of reasons why we should head out

and invest in an iPhone SE.
