New Delhi, Dec. 21 -- Apple cut prices of its latest iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s
Plus by up to 16 per cent just two months after their launch in India to boost
flagging sales in what is historically its most crucial quarter as demand for
the flagship devices nosedived from a Diwali high.

The price of the iPhone 6s 16 GB model, which was introduced at Rs 62,000 on
October 16, has fallen by 11-16 per cent and now ranges between Rs 52,000 and Rs
55,000, according to four large retailers who spoke to ET on condition of
anonymity. The price cuts are across all variants - 16 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB - of
both models. The average difference in prices of all iPhone 6s and 6s Plus
devices between launch time and now is about 15 per cent, a top executive at a
national retailer said. The reduction also narrows the gap with prices of iPhone
6 devices launched in 2014, making an upgrade more attractive for customers.
"The price difference between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s was a lot, so many
customers are not willing to upgrade to the new model," said a senior executive
of another national retailer.
