

Apple has finally revealed its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , the firm's first
smartphone to boast both water and dust resistance .

Unveiled during the firm's hotly-awaited launch event in San Francisco today,
the new iPhone doesn't look too different to last year's iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S
Plus devices, sporting the same aluminium design and rounded edges - but this
time without the iconic antenna lines.

As with the iPhone 6 and 6S, both new iPhone devices come with different storage
options. This year, Apple have doubled the capacities available when the device
launches. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will therefore be available in 32GB,
128GB or 256GB capacities.

Apple said during its keynote that it has kept the prices of its new smartphones
the same as the iPhone 6S when it launched last year for their respective
storage options. However, because the 16GB is not available any longer, this
means the cheapest option is now more expensive.

In the UK, Apple said the iPhone 7 will be available from a starting price of
£599 for the cheapest 32GB option.

The 128GB version is £699 and the 256GB version will set you back a whopping
£799.

The larger iPhone 7 Plus will be even more of a wallet buster than it's smaller
sibling.

The cheapest (32GB) iPhone 7 Plus costs £719, followed by a 128GB model at£819,
and then a 256GB variant costing an astonishing £919.

Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will come in the usual Black, Gold, Silver,
Rose Gold colour options, alongside a new black called simply "Jet Black", which
is much darker than previous black models. They will be available to pre-order
from 9 September before they start shipping on 16 September in the UK.

You can pre-order via the Apple store from now.

The good news for those not wanting to splash out hundreds for a brand new
smartphone is that Apple has slashed the price of its iPhone 6S models after the
launch of the iPhone 7.

Apple has taken £100 off its previous generation smartphones, so it's very
possible that the iPhone 6s will be available from around £499, with the first
iPhone 6 being discontinued.

Also note that all the UK networks will be offering contract deals shortly after
the iPhone 7 announcement, so keep your eyes peeled for that.
