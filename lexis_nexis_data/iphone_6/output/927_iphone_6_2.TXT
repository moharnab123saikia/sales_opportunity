rumoured to be launched in August, we are getting alleged leaked images of the
new phone.

GSMArena has posted pics of the new phone leaked last week- comparing to iPhone
5S and iPod. One pic also featured the iPhone 6 dropped in water. Wither it is
water resistant or it is a non-working prototype.

The iPhone 6 is under production in China and leaked in dimension of 7mm and 6.1
mm thickness. "Apple security in China seems to have really broken down as an
iPhone 6 dummy was photographed all around a city", says the news report.
