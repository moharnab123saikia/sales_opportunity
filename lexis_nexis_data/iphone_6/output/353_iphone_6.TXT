prices for the device have topped $3,000, a Citigroup analyst says.

Ten countries, including the U.S., are in the first wave of markets where the
iPhone 6 is being sold.

"Apple has indicated 115 countries by year-end, exceeding the prior year's (
iPhone 5 S) launch of just over 100 countries by year-end," said Jim Suva, a
Citigroup analyst in a report Monday. "Importantly, China's exact launch date is
still unknown. We note gray-market pricing for iPhone 6 shipments to China are
priced above $3,000."

China represents around 17% of Apple's sales, he noted.

China Mobile, the country's biggest wireless firm, began selling the iPhone 5 S
only in March, following China Telecom and China Unicom. News agency Xinhua on
Sept. 18 said that Apple needs one more network license approval to launch the
iPhone 6 in China.

"China generally tends to get overstated in terms of size and opportunity (at
least over the near/medium term), thus the impact is not 20%-25% of iPhone
demand, in our opinion. We feel it is much smaller," Wells Fargo analyst Maynard
Um said a report. "We also believe that demand in other regions is likely to
rise, as those in China who want the iPhone are likely to procure an iPhone 6/6
Plus from other countries."

More important than the timing of the iPhone 6 launch in China is why the delay
occurred, Um said. It could be related to concerns raised in July by state-run
China Central TV that the iPhone might be a threat to national security, he
said.

Apple on Monday said that first-weekend sales of the iPhone 6 family of
smartphones topped 10 million units, roughly in line with analyst expectations.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company did not have enough new iPhones to meet
demand.
