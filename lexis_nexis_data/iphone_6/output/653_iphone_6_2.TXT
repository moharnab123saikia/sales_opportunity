tested the alleged front panel of the next iPhone.

Brownlee said he obtained the panel from prolific Apple leaker Sonny Dickson.

In his latest video posted Friday, Brownlee put the iPhone 6 panel through
vigorous tests using the Mohs scale of material hardness.

Materials rated higher on that 1-10 scale can scratch any materials rated lower.
The Gorilla Glass used for the iPhone 5S is rated at 6.8. Pure sapphire is rated
at a 9.0 and is said to be the material used for the iPhone 6 panel.

Brownlee used two kinds of high-quality sandpaper that are relatively high on
the Mohs scale: garnet (7.0), and emery (8.0). He tested both the iPhone 6 panel
and the Gorilla Glass display from iPhone 5S for comparison.

Unfortunately for Apple fans hoping for an 'indestructible' screen, the new
panel supposedly made of sapphire did not withstand either sandpaper. However,
more damage was done to the Gorilla Glass of iPhone 5S than the alleged iPhone 6
panel.

In other words, the front panel of iPhone 6 is definitely harder than the
Gorilla glass, both in theory and in reality.

Brownlee says in his video said 'That actually makes sense. Using a massive
panel of pure sapphire for the front of a phone would be a little bit stupid. It
would be much more expensive and it also wouldn't be able to bend like it did.'

'Basically, it (the new panel) is a composite involving sapphire to make it
overall stronger than the Gorilla Glass of previous iPhones, or many other
phones out there. And it works, as you saw.'
