Plaza site typically gets overnight lines.


Travis Stanford rather shyly confessed Friday that he had more than $1,400 in
motivation to stay overnight on the sidewalk at International Plaza mall to be
first in line for the iPhone 6. He's got a buyer on the side.

The money has already cleared my PayPal account, said Stanford, who did buy one
phone for himself, so it wasn't all just capitalism. There are so few iPhone 6
in the Plus sizes, there's a shortage now, and they're not shipping them for
months.. So a buddy of mine paid me to be here.

Stanford was one of thousands of Apple devotees in and around Tampa, and hordes
more around the world, who again lined up, some overnight, to be among the first
to buy the latest iPhone.

In this case it's the iPhone 6 and a larger version called the iPhone 6 Plus
that counts more as a phablet, or phone-tablet combination.

Apple has seen record preorders for the phone, and some iPhone 6 Plus buyers who
didn't get their orders in early enough may have to wait until Apple catches up
with production demands.

Tampa's International Plaza mall was again the site of devoted Apple buyers
willing to stay overnight for a place in line, even if that meant sleeping on
the sidewalks amid the trash bins behind the mall, where security staff are now
used to stationing portable toilets.

By 8 a.m., several hundred people were waiting to get in. Greg Rainha was at the
front.

We got here about 9 o'clock, and based on two years ago, we thought it would
come in handy to get here a little bit early, Rainha said. It turns out that I
was the first person to preorder in this area, so they let me in. I was standing
in line and got here, and it went really fast, so I'm really stoked.

With the new phone finally in hand, Rainha gave a quick critique. I got to say
it's incredibly light, he said. The curve on it is amazing. I really am stoked
about how really thin (it is). The profile is awesome. It's actually a little
bit smoother than the5.

Rainha's girlfriend, Abigail Russell, came along to stay in line with him and
considered the whole experience entertainment.

So much of life now you do online; there's no real experience, she said. You get
that experience when you come out to something like this.

Rainha's co-worker Jim Thompson gave him some friendly grief because he was
actually in line ahead of Rainha but got out of the store later because of a
breakdown in Apple's checkout system.

Yeah, the Plus size is a lot bigger, he said, flipping around his new white
phone. But if it doesn't fit in my pocket, I'll get bigger pockets.

At the AT&T store in South Tampa, more than 100 people were waiting outside when
the doors opened at 8 a.m. Friday. The line started forming about 10 p.m.
Thursday, with Romulus Ignat at the front, AT&T spokeswoman Karen McAllister
said.

Ignat, of Tampa, said he made a last-minute decision to camp out so he could get
the iPhone 6 Plus.

Adding to the demand, Verizon Wireless, AT&T and Sprint all launched offers for
people to trade in their old iPhones for discounts on the new iPhone 6, which
boasts a larger screen, and the ability to turn on wireless payments.

That payment system should go live in waves as different retailers and banks
build out their systems to handle the transactions. Nike, Target, Bank of
America and others already have signed up for the system, called Apple Pay.

As for Stanford, who was paid to stand in line, he said he's not done yet. It's
a payday, he said. I may head over to Tyrone Square mall to get another one.
