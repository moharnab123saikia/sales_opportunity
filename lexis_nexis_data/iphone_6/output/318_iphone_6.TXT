revealing Apple's much talked about and awaited Iphone 6 on the Chinese social
networking website Weibo. The photo looks like a press render of the phone and
highlights a tagline saying 'even better', confirming the launch of the Iphone 6
with a bigger display and better features on September 9.

First spotted by Sina News, the photo seem to have been posted accidentally and
was soon been taken down from the site. The photo does not only show off the
curved-edge design of the iPhone 6, but also confirms that it would be called as
the iPhone 6. Recently, leakster Feld & Volk too had posted a photo of the
iPhone 6, which showed off a Samsung-like curved side profile of the phone. The
photo also shows that iPhone 6 will come in three colors- silver, grey and gold.

This is not the first time that the iPhone 6 has been spotted online, as there
have earlier been a number of specification-, photo and video-leaks which have
revealed most of the design elements of Apple's yet to be announced iPhone 6. So
far, reports have revealed that the iPhone 6 will don a new design with 4.7-inch
and a larger 5.5-inch display size, come with slightly rectangular keys, and
bring a protruding rear camera.
