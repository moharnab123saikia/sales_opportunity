Tuesday, October 29, 2013: The next generation Apple iPhone 6 could reportedly
be announced in the summer of 2014. According to reports, Gene Munster, senior
analyst for Piper Jaffray, a US investment bank, has sent a note to Apple
investors mentioning that the technology giant will be launching the eighth
instalment in its successful iPhone series with a bigger display. The new iPhone
will reportedly be launched in September next year.

Munster is not the only analyst to predict the launch of the iPhone 6 next year
with a bigger display though. Another analyst, Brian White, has also said the
same thing. White's reportedly made the statement after meeting with a supplier.
Gizbot quoted White as saying, "Our meeting with a tech supply chain vendor
highlighted a bigger iPhone is in the works, and our contact expects a launch in
the 2Q:14/3Q:14 time frame. Nearly a year ago, our research in Asia uncovered
early stage work on a larger iPhone and we indicated in our Apple initiation
report dated 9/4/13 that a larger screen size on the iPhone is possible in 2014,
that could approach 5-inches. Given today's meeting, we are confident that a
larger iPhone (approximately five inches) will become a reality in 2014."

Further, Gizbot also reported that Peter Misek, an analyst from Jeffries, also
believes that the Cupertino-based technology giant is in advanced stages of
launching the iPhone with a bigger display. Misek though pointed towards a
12.1-cm (4.8-inch) screen.

Apple's recent iPhone 5S has received a lot of flak for the lack of a big enough
screen. In addition, the company also tried its hand with a low cost iPhone 5C,
which has reportedly not reaped the rewards the company was hoping to. With
screen sizes going as big as 6-inches with the Nokia Lumia 1520, the pressure is
on Apple to come up with something bigger.
