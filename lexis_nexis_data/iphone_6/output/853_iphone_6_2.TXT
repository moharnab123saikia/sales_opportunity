Apple is planning to sell SIM-free versions of its latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6
Plus models across the US, via the company's physical retail stores and online
store.

Presently, the phones are available only through contract, with the unlocked
version available on T-Mobile which works using different carriers. However,
users in the US cannot technically buy the latest phones SIM-free through
official channels in the country.

With the latest move, users will be able to buy iPhone 6 and 6 Plus without a
SIM-card which will enable them to use their phones all around the world using a
carrier of their choice, reported 9 to 5 Mac.

The price for SIM-free iPhones is expected to the same as that of T-Mobile
variants which ranges between $649 and $949 depending upon the screen size and
storage capacity.

Apple has already introduced SIM- free version of iPhones in other countries,
and in 2012 and 2013 the company sold unlocked version of iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S
two months after its initial launch.
