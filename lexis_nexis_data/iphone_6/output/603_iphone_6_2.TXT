already looking at the iPhone 6.

Wednesday, October 09, 2013: So while we wait till 28 October for Apple to
unveil its fourth quarter earnings report, it is fairly certain that it will be
driven by the iPhone 5S sales. The new smartphone has received criticism and
acclaim alike. While this continues, the rumours about the Apple iPhone 6 have
already started going around. Here are some of the top rumours about expected
features of the iPhone 6.

Solar Charging Touch Screen: In February, Apple has reportedly filed a patent
for technology, which allows solar charging to be integrated onto a touch
screen. If the company can develop this and use it in the iPhone 6, then it will
be the biggest advancement in mobile technology.

Camera: When it comes to the camera, Apple is in a way lagging behind the
competitors. Since the iPhone 6 is expected to be larger, the camera is also
expected to bring some big changes. Some say it will have something like the
Nokia Lumia 1020's 41 mega pixel camera. While that remains to be seen, but a 13
mega pixel camera should be added.

Sapphire Glass: There are rumours that Apple is planning to use Sapphire Glass
for the screen on the iPhone 6. If true, this would give a new meaning to
Apple's premium image and would make the screen miles stronger and durable than
any other in the market.

Processor: The Apple A7 has been a good innovation from the company, but with
the iPhone 6, Apple should definitely be coming up with an octa-core chipset.
Rumours are that Apple is planning to make an Octa-Core version for it's current
A7 processor.
