

Apple fans are intrigued by an image posted online believed to be a leaked
preview shot of the latest iPhone.

The photo shows what Apple fans believe is the "iPhone 5se", the iPhone model
Apple is expected to launch in March, pictured beside the iPhone 5. It was
published on website One More Thing, the same site which had a leaked image of
the iPad Air 2 display two years ago as well as the iPad Air design.

Apple specialist site 9to5Mac reported sources had revealed the phone would be
known as iPhone 5se, meaning "special edition" or "enhanced".

The iPhone would have a 4-inch screen, the same size as the iPhone 5, and
feature the curved glass of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s.

It would feature the same 8 megapixel rear camera as the iPhone 6 and sources
told 9to5Mac that the iPhone 5se would feature the A9 and M9 processor, like the
iPhone 6s.

The website said it believed the iPhone 5se would replace the iPhone 6 and 6
plus in the line-up, and appeal to people who want all the up-to-date features
in a more compact form.

The March announcement by Apple is also expected to feature an iPhone 7, or a
new iPhone model by a different name. An upgrade to the Apple Watch was also
expected to feature in the presentation.

The photos of the model could turn out to be fake, but the site One More Thing
has published leaked images from "Apple insiders" which turned out to be
legitimate before.
