6 Plus have broken records as Apple's most popular smartphones.

Apple has received more than four million pre-orders for the two phones that
have some fans queuing outside of stores ahead of the release on Friday.

That is about double the number of pre-orders for the iPhone 5 when it was
released two years ago.

"Pre-orders for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus set a new record for Apple," Apple's
chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement.

Analysts are predicted Apple will sell up to 10 million iPhones in the first
weekend.The bigger 14cm phablet with the iPhone 6 Plus is the major drawcard.
