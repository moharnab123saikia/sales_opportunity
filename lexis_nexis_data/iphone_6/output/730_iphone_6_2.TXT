be available in India beginning Friday, October 17. Pre-orders for the two
phones will begin Tuesday, October 7.

The good news here is that contradictory to earlier speculation, the iPhone 6
Plus is also coming to India. However, unlike earlier years Apple has not yet
listed the price of the two phones or its different variants. "Pricing details
will be soon made available by Apple's partners: Ingram Micro, Redington, Rashi
Peripherals and Reliance." the note said.

IndianExpress.com had earlier reported that the iPhone 6 will be coming to India
by October 18 at a price of around Rs 55,000. E-commerce players like
Grabmore.in are already taking pre-orders for the iPhone 6 from Indian
customers.

Another interesting aspect of any new iPhone launch is the price cut on earlier
models. That is where usually Apple rakes in a lot of volume.
