keys: Apple is preparing to use supertough, scratch-resistant sapphire displays
on the upcoming iPhone 6.

Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri says his supply-chain checks in Asia indicate Apple
will use sapphire crystal displays for both sizes of its rumored larger-screen
iPhone 6, but not all versions. He says versions of the 4.7-inch model might use
a mix of Corning Gorilla Glass, the incumbent supplier, and new sapphire
displays from its supply deal with GT Advanced Technologies.

At least one, if not all, versions of the jumbo-sized, 5.5-inch iPhone 6 will
use sapphire displays, he said.

Pricing will be tiered for the iPhone 6 models, he said, but it's unclear how
the sapphire displays might boost pricing.

Arcuri is expecting a traditional September launch for the iPhone 6 as well as a
wearable device.

But Taiwan's Economic Daily News on Tuesday claimed that only the larger
5.5-inch iPhone 6 will include a sapphire display due to production limitations.
The Taiwanese news service said Apple only had enough sapphire displays for the
5.5-inch iPhone 6 and the iWatch wearable.
