Apple may go big and bigger with the iPhone 6 this year.

Nikkei reports that the iPhone 6 will release in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch variants,
which are both larger than the tiny 4-inch screen of the iPhone 5S, and a unique
move to cater to multiple markets at once.Â There is no mention if the smaller
iPhone 6 will be a 'mini version' of sorts.

The report also claims the smartphones will release in September.

Last month, we got a rough leak on the supposed final look of the iPhone 6,
showcasing a larger screen, ultra thin bezel, and of course, the TouchID-enabled
Home Screen button.
