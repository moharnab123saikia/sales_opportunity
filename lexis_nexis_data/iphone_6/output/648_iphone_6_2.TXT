reported that it disrupted cell phone calls and blocked access to Touch ID, its
fingerprint security sensor.

Shares of Apple slid 1% to 101.75 as the Nasdaq rallied 1%.

Bugs in Apple's iOS 8 mobile operating system had earlier delayed the launch of
HealthKit apps for the iPhone 6. While the iOS 8.1 fixed the health app-related
issues, some iPhone users had complained on Twitter that they were losing cell
phone service and access to Touch ID, which works with Apple's new mobile
payment service.

"We are actively investigating these reports and will provide information as
quickly as we can," Apple said in a statement.

Apple announced the iOS 8 operating system on Sept. 9 in tandem with the launch
of the  iPhone 6. Apple released the iOS 8.1 update early Wednesday.

It's no longer available via over-the air downloads. Apple also pulled the
software update from its developer center. Apple said users could go to its
iTunes store to restore their phone's software to an earlier version.

Apple critics late Wednesday jumped on the flawed update as the company's latest
mishap, following the online streaming problems on the company's website for the
iPhone 6 announcement.

Some early iPhone 6 Plus users, meanwhile, this week said the device bends under
pressure if stored in front or back pockets for long periods.

Apple on Monday said first-weekend sales of the iPhone 6 family of smartphones
topped 10 million units, roughly in line with analyst expectations. Apple's
stock has gained over 3% since it launched the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on
Sept. 9.
