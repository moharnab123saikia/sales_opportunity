dreams come alive when Apple Inc. launches its most awaited 1Phone 6 as
forecasted by Jefferies analyst Peter Misek.

Soon after the brief meet with the Apple's Asian suppliers, Misek issued a note
to investors on Monday saying the iPhone 6 would offer a 4.8-inch screen.
Obviously a great news as currently the iPhones come with only 4 inch display
screen.

Apple Inc. may unveil iPhone 6 at a top end price of Rs 60,335

Though the analyst did not disclose the reason behind his prediction, he
mentioned in his note that the new screen size would drive a huge number of
upgrades.

"We think the 85M iPhones eligible for an upgrade when the iPhone 6 launches (we
think Apple is targeting Sep 2014) could be boosted by another 5-10M from people
who skipped the 5S/5C cycle," Misek wrote.

On the downside, iPhone 5C sales have been weak, according to Misek. As such,
manufacturing builds are being slashed to 15 million to 20 million from 30
million, he said.

On the plus size, that could lead to an even larger number of upgraders who
gravitate toward the iPhone 6.

In the past, Apple has lost significant market share to the Android phones
having larger display size.

Last year, Apple has raised the display size of iPhone 5 to 4 inches from the
prior 3.5 inches, so time is right for another development.
