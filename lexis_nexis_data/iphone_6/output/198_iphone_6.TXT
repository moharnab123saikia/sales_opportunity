concept designs of the upcoming model, throughout the year. The latest
speculation says, Apple might go bezel-less on the next iPhone, the iPhone 6.

"Amid the mounting rumors about the upcoming unveiling event from Samsung
Electronics later this month, fresh speculation surfaced on Tuesday that Samsung
Electronics and Apple Inc. would both roll out bezel-free phones that support
fingerprint scanning for their next-generation flagship models a the Galaxy S5
and the iPhone 6" reported the KoreaHerald yesterday.

Bendy Galaxy S5 and flexible iPhone 6S to launch later in 2014

According to its source, Apple is also testing a prototype with bezel-less
screen and a fingerprint scanner.

"Speculation about an iPhone with an edge-to-edge display has been around for
years. The problem is, the real next-gen iPhone, aka iPhone 6, isn't due for a
long time. So, Apple could very well be testing a bezel-free design, but what
the company ultimately decides is unknown" says Cnet.

Though few concept iPhone 6 have been expecting a bezel-less display, we are yet
to come across any concrete leak. As far as the fingerprint scanner goes, we can
expect this new technology introduced with the iPhone 5S to be there on the
iPhone 6 as well.
