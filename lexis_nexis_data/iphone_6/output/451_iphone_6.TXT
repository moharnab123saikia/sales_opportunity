

Apple has finally announced the Iphone 6 which comes with a 4.7-inch display.
The phone will be up against Apple's arch rival Samsung's recently launched
Galaxy Alpha, which essentially was Samsung's take on the metallic iPhone
models. In the Iphone 6, Apple has made some changes in the design language of
the iPhone and has added bigger display to give an edge to its phone over its
competitors.

Samsung's Alpha on the other hand is the company's first Smartphone to boast a
metal frame. It was designed keeping in view all the rumors of the new Iphone 6.
The Galaxy Alpha has a metallic body, iPhone's design and look, and will pose as
a perfect competitor of the iPhone 4.7 incher.

We compare the specs of the newly launched iPhone 6 with the Samsung's Galaxy
Alpha to know which one brings better specifications on paper.
