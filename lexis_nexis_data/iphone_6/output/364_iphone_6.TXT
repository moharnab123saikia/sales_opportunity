iPhone 6 Plus devices.

Last year, Apple sold 9m of its iPhone 5S and 5C in 11 countries. This year it
exceeded that figure despite launching in just 10 countries, missing out on the
huge Chinese market where it is unlikely to sell the iPhone 6 until 2015.

"Sales for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded our expectations for the launch
weekend, and we couldn't be happier," said Apple's chief executive Tim Cook.

Apple's manufacturing partner in China, Foxconn, reportedly has 200,000 workers
across 100 production lines producing around 140,000 iPhone 6 Plus and 400,000
iPhone 6 devices every day.

"While our team managed the manufacturing ramp better than ever before, we could
have sold many more iPhones with greater supply and we are working hard to fill
orders as quickly as possible," added Cook.
