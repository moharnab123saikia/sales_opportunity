when official Apple store opened in US

Ahmedabad: There seems to be one more reason to believe that Amdavadis are tech
savvy and brand-crazy, as Ram Agrawal, a Class X student, became the first owner
of iPhone 6 in India exactly when it was being launched in the US on Friday. He
claims that he got hold of the phone even before it reached tech-crazy Apple
fans in the US.

Agrawal says he was always an ardent Apple fan and would always buy the latest
versions of the phone ever since he was in Class II. Sharing his new-found joy,
he said, "I have already posted my photos posing with iPhone 6 on Facebook, and
my friends are surprised. I bought the phone paying more than the actual market
price, but I feel it's worth the product."

The dealer who got iPhone 6 for him says that he delivered the phone to Agrawal
on Friday at around 9 pm (which was 8:30 am in San Francisco, USA, where Apple's
official store is located). He added that Agrawal was so eager to have the phone
that he won't accept even an hour's delay.

Officially, iPhone 6 is set to launch in India in October, but it is already
available in grey market at premium price.

Agrawal's previous mobile phone was an iPhone 5S. He adds, "I have been buying
iPhones for many years now, and would continue to do so whenever the latest
iPhone hits the market. This is my eighth iPhone." He is passionate about the
latest gadgets and plans to pursue a career in information technology.

Agrawal's iPhone 6 is a space-grey coloured model, with 116GB memory. He,
however, refused to disclose the actual amount he paid for the phone.

When asked if the latest acquisition would hamper his studies, he said, "I am
sure it will not, since I don't plan to carry it to the school."
