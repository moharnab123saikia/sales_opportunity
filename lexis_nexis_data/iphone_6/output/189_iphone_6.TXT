Plus it introduced Tuesday imitates its competitors, mostly Samsung, by offering
bigger phones.

The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen. The iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen. The
older iPhone models isc4 inches on the diagonal. Samsungcs Galaxy is 5.7 inches.

Images of the new phones flashed behind Tim Cook, Applecs CEO, with the slogan,
cBigger than bigger.cc

Why make the switch? Some customers told that they found a bigger screen more
useful. c

Part of the reason Samsung went the route of bigger screens is because many
Asian customers often do not have home computers, relying on their phones for
their computing and Internet access. There is greater demand for the cphabletc
market, says The Guardian.

But Apple has followed others before only to completely outpace them. Think what
happened with the iPod and the MP3 players. Keeping with Applecs aesthetic, the
new iPhones are thinner.
