The news means the devices will hit the Chinese market, the largest smartphone
market in the world, about a month after they became available in the U.S. and
other countries.

China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued network access
licenses to the new Apple phones after the tech giant addressed privacy risks
raised in a government agency's safety test, the Wall Street Journalreported.
The ministry's concerns included software that it argued could be used by third
parties to access user data.

Analysts have lauded the strong early sales trends for the new iPhones,
including a company record for sales over the first weekend.
