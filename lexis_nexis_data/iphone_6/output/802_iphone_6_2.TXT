

T-Mobile has made an announcement that it is going to take a new initiative to
sell Apple's latest iPhone 6s and 6s Plus smartphones for just $5 per month in
case customers trade in eligible late-model smartphones.

Previously in September, T-Mobile declared a special $20 per month rate for a
year and 6 months for a 16GB iPhone 6s via the Jump On Demand program of the
company, with zero down.

But, now T-Mobile is about to bring down its prices even more, with a rate of $5
a month if a customer trades in a working and intact Apple iPhone 6 or 6 Plus,
Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge or a Galaxy Note 5
smartphone. For the deal no down payment is needed.

As a part of the new promotion, in case customers trade in an iPhone 5s or a
Samsung Note 4 or Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone on a 16GB iPhone 6s, they will
have to pay $10 per month for 18 months. If customers trade in almost any other
mobile set, the rate will be $15 per month.

Besides this, T-Mobile customers can also get larger capacity iPhone 6s and
iPhone 6s Plus models under the lower-priced Jump On Demand offerings.

A 128GB iPhone 6s will be sold for $199.99 down and $3 per month along with a
trade-in of an Apple iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, Galaxy S6, Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+,
Galaxy S6 Edge or a Galaxy Note 5 smartphone. It can be done for $8 per month
with the trade of an iPhone 5s or a Samsung Note 4 or Samsung Galaxy S5
smartphone. The rate would be $13 a month on the trade of almost any other
phone.
