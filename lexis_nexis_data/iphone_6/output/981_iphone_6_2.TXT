new iPhones pre-ordered, UK sources say.

The launch of the new iPhones is prompting users to buy larger screen sizes in
unprecedented numbers, as the base model now offers a 4.7-inch screen and the
larger model sits firmly in the previously challenging "phablet" space, between
mobile phones and tablets.

Sources at UK mobile networks said that the largest, 5.5-inch iPhone Plus
accounts for 30pc of all orders and has largely already sold out. The 64GB
model, previously the highest capacity available, is now either the best-selling
or the equal of the cheaper 16GB version.

The 6 Plus, which starts at Â£619, has also sold out on Apple's online store,
with delivery times now quoted as three to four weeks.

Although mobile networks said they expected a positive response, they admitted
the high proportion of 6 Plus orders had taken them by surprise.

One suggested that the growing popularity of watching films and TV on
smartphones, as well as the device's significantly longer battery life, were the
most likely reasons.

With the new, 4.7-inch iPhone 6, however, continuing to be the focus for most
customers, network sources suggested that it is ensuring Apple both retains its
existing customers and that it is even starting to take customers back from
Google's rival Android operating system.

Both devices officially go on sale on Friday, and have received a "record number
of pre-orders", according to the company.

"Response to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been incredible," an Apple spokesman
said.

US customers ordered more than 4m handsets within 24 hours, which exceeded the
initial pre-order supply, meaning some may not ship until October, Apple said.

Phones 4U has issued a statement reassuring customers who placed orders for the
two models that they would be refunded following the announcement that the
retailer collapsed into administration on Sunday night.
