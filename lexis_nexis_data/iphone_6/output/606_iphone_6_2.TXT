Fans of iPhone 6 are bracing themselves for a delay to the new gadget's release
date.

Apple were looking to go ahead with a single launch day, planned for both the
standard 4.7inch model and the larger 5.5inch, believed to be September 19.

But with mutterings of production issues with the bigger handset, this could to
be unlikely.

An industry insider and proven revealer of Apple's intentions, Ming-Chi Kuo, has
highlighted the issue responsible for the delays.

He said that the technology giant is already facing production snags with the
4.7inch model related to touch technology and the casing colouring of the
device.

His report said that these problems are exaggerated on the bigger model which
could push the launch of the phablet into early next year.

With gossip and speculation setting the social networking world alight - the
iPhone 6 really is the smartphone everyone has been waiting for.

Some of the features thought to be included on the new handset are a virtually
indestructible sapphire crystal display - according to a leaked video.

iPhone 6 sapphire display

Apple has used sapphire glass before in both the camera lenses and TouchID
sensors on the iPhone 5S, but if the video shows what it could do, the iPhone 6
will be the first smartphone to come to market using the mineral to make its
whole display.

It's expected that the glass - which represents a vast improvement in both
durability and thickness over the Gorilla glass in use on current models - will
eventually be used throughout Apple's iPhone, iPad and wearable devices.

There are also rumours the 5.5inch model will pack 128gb of internal storage,
more curved, stylish edges, and a smart locking system that will see the device
automatically unlock in a safe location like your home.
