

Wall Street analysts underestimate the sales potential of Apple's upcoming
iPhone 6 S series handsets, Nomura Securities analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a
research report.

Kvaal initiated coverage of Apple stock on Thursday with a buy rating and a
price target of 145. Apple closed Friday at 121.30.

After the big success of Apple's bigger-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets, few
expect much from this year's model, the iPhone 6 S, to be released in September.

The consensus view for iPhone unit volumes in fiscal 2016, which starts Sept.
27, "is that growth will be close to nil," Kvaal said.

Consensus estimates are modeling for 233 million iPhone units in fiscal 2016 vs.
230 million in the current fiscal year, he said.

"We believe the iPhone 6 S cycle will be stronger than expected," he added.

By the time Apple launches the iPhone 6 S, the iPhone 6 will have penetrated 35%
to 40% of the iPhone user base, Kvaal said. That leaves a lot of room for growth
not only for the iPhone 6 S but also for lower-priced iPhone 6 models, he said.

Apple traditionally cuts the prices for its older-model handsets when it
releases a new model.

Nomura is modeling iPhone unit sales growth of nearly 8% to 250 million units in
fiscal 2016.

Kvaal sees particular strength in China and emerging markets, and among people
switching from Google Android-based phones.

Apple also might try selling a lower-priced model iPhone next spring called the
iPhone 6 C, Kvaal said.

Apple's previous attempt at a lower-priced iPhone, the iPhone 5 C, sold poorly
because the price gap between it and the iPhone 5 S was not wide enough, he
said.

The iPhone 6 C is likely to have a greater price gap with the standard 6 S
models, he said. It probably will have a plastic case like the iPhone 5 C and
may return to the classic smaller 4-inch screen size, he said.
