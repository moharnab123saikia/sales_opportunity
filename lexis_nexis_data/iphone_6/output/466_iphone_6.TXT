debut weekend, according to a Piper Jaffray Cos. survey, and supplies of the
larger model already are selling out in some U.S. stores.

The iPhone 6 Plus is "more popular," Gene Munster, an analyst for Piper Jaffray
in Minneapolis, said in a report today. The survey of 386 Apple customers
waiting in line in Minneapolis and New York yesterday found that 57 percent
intended to buy the iPhone 6 Plus, he said. Munster said he had expected buyers
to split 50-50 between the models this weekend and shift more in favor of the
smaller phone over time.

More buyers also said they would pay for higher storage capacity for either
phone than for the iPhone 5S last year. The survey showed 22 percent choosing 16
gigabytes, 52 percent picking 64 GB and 26 percent opting for 128 GB. Last year,
35 percent planned to buy 16 GB, 39 percent intended to get 64 GB and 25 percent
wanted 128 GB, Munster said.

The shift to higher storage capacity and larger phones "will provide an
incremental benefit to gross margins," Munster said. That should help revenue
outpace analysts' average estimate by 9 percent and earnings estimates by almost
12 percent in the three months through December, he said.
