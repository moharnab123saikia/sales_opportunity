

CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple sold more than 10 million units of the iPhone 6 and 6
Plus as the gadgets debuted this past weekend, the company said Monday.

The sales figures, which mark a new record for Apple, came as little surprise
after a weekend in which legions of people in many countries around the globe
lined up for hours to buy the new phones. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company
bested the 9 million phones it sold last year when the iPhone 5s and 5c debuted.

"Sales for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded our expectations for the launch
weekend, and we couldn't be happier," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.
"We would like to thank all of our customers for making this our best launch
ever, shattering all previous sell-through records by a large margin."

Though Apple still managed to log plenty of sales, supplies of the new iPhones
appeared to be straining under demand. The iPhone 6 Plus, in particular, sold
out quickly.

"While our team managed the manufacturing ramp better than ever before, we could
have sold many more iPhones with greater supply and we are working hard to fill
orders as quickly as possible."

Analysts expected that Apple would enjoy a gusher of sales when it finally
responded to consumers' cries for phones with larger screens. The iPhone 6,
which starts at $199 with a two-year contract, measures 4.7 inches diagonally,
and the $299 6 Plus has a screen of 5.5 inches.

Apple has also said the phones have sharper displays, better cameras and
extended battery life. In addition, people who purchase the new gadgets will
gain access to Apple Pay, a mobile payments service that lets customers make
purchases in stores with a wave of their phones.
