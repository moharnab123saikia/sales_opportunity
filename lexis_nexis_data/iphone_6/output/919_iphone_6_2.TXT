talking about it. We use data from the iPhone's past to predict its future.

Our first key statistic - depth.In 2024 we'll be buying empty packaging

Given that most years the iPhone gets thinner, it's obvious that at some point
it'll have become so thin that people will queue overnight outside Apple stores
to spend their hard-earned on a beautiful piece of empty packaging.

iPhone DepthBy 2040, the iPhone will be as light as a feather

As the iPhone's depth decreases, so too, does its weight. By 2036 it'll be
lighter than the human soul (according to the 1920s research of Dr Duncan
MacDougall) at just 20 grams. By the 2040s it'll be as light as a feather, quite
literally.

iPhone weight

As we can see, eventually the iPhone will become so good that it no longer has a
physical form - we'll all just happily send our money directl to Apple. Roll on
that glorious day!But these specs will probably remain constant

Enough about the future - here's what we know about the iPhone 6 so far:

1) The iPhone will be rectangular

Apple has a reputation for making rectangular phones. In fact, all previous the
iPhones have been rectangular. We think that this year's iPhone will be exactly
the same shape or similar - except thinner, lighter, and/or possibly heavier and
thicker with more features that you didn't know you needed.

2) You'll be able to "make calls"

Experts believe the next model iPhone will have voice-chat capabilities,
enabling you to speak to a far-away friend without resorting to shouting down
two baked-bean cans on a bit of string.

3) It'll have a camera

Cameras are useful for taking photos and uploading them to Facebook in an effort
to convince everybody you're having more fun than they are.

We may even get lucky with more than one camera in this model.
