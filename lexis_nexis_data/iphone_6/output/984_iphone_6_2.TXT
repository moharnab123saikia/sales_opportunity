Takorn Tantasith, secretary-general of the National Broadcasting and
Telecommunications Commission, yesterday insisted that his tweet about the NBTC
awarding its standard certification to the new iPhone 6 was in line with the
regulator's responsibility to keep the public informed as part of its
consumer-protection role.

His remark followed questions on some online sites that his tweet might affect
the iPhone marketing strategy in Thailand.

Apple representatives met with Takorn yesterday to make it clear that the
company had yet to finalise whether the two approved models would be named
iPhone 6.

Takorn had tweeted on Tuesday that the NBTC had approved this "type" of device,
which would allow the iPhone 6 to be sold in this country.

On the same day, he also told reporters that Apple South Asia (Thailand) sent
two models of the iPhone 6 for certification. The NBTC approved the types last
Friday.

Informing the public that the iPhone 6 model passed this type approval would
make consumers feel confident about purchasing the model, he added.

He claimed the tweet did not amount to divulging the company's trade information
to the public.

It is his own judgement to release any information to the public for consumers'
benefit, he added.
