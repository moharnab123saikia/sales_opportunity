record breaking figure. Franchesca Hashemi writes

This is in comparison to the 70 million iPhone 6 handsets from last year.

The company may not only be hedging its sales figures on the success of two new
iPhones but also the adoption of Apple Pay.

The approximate 90 million handsets order is believed to accommodate two
different iPhone models, one with a 4.7-inch display and the other a 5.5-inch
display. These are the same screen sizes as the previous models: the iPhone 6
and 6 Plus.

It could be argued that 90 million handsets is an oversight. Yet Apple managed
to surpass its own prediction for earnings in the last quarter of 2014, making
$74.6bn instead of $66.5bn.

The last iPhone was launch during a holiday, and it is to be expected that
iPhone 6 and 6Plus will be available after Christmas (31 December 2015).

Leaked images of the new iPhone were analysed by Apple experts at 9to5mac.com,
who said: "[The images show] updated NFC, 16 GB base storage, fewer chips, and
subtle design tweaks".

The iPhone 6S is also expected to have an updated Force Touch system, a better
camera, a different colour range, and includes a Qualcomm LTE chip for double
speed data updates.

Force Touch is said to differentiate between a light tap and deep press, a
feature which already exists on new MacBooks and Apple Watches.

Sales figures for Apple's first large screen iPhone, the iPhone 6, for the first
fiscal term ended September 2014 hit 135.6 million, according to the Wall Street
Journal. This is a 43% increase from the previous year.

The iPhone 6s will be shown to the public for the first time in September 2015.
