BEIJING - Apple Inc's iPhone 6 is in the final stages of review for approval,
with results due shortly, a top Chinese government regulator said in an
interview published on Tuesday by Tencent.

The status of the iPhone 6 in China has been a mystery since Apple unveiled the
device this month without releasing a launch date for the world's largest
smartphone market.

The delay has led to widespread speculation the iPhone has run into difficulty
securing regulatory approval from China's Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology (MIIT), with some reports suggesting the launch could be delayed
until 2015.

"The iPhone 6 has entered the final stage of the approval process, now it's just
a matter of time," MIIT chief Miao Wei told Tencent in an exclusive interview in
Beijing. "Netizens, please wait patiently."

Miao declined to offer a timeframe for completion of the review, saying only
that he expected a result "very soon".

The ministry could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday.
