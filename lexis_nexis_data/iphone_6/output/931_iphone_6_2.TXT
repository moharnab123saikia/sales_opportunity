Thursday, September 18, 2014: Few days back there was a huge buzz created in the
market about the fall in iPhone 5s price in India. But the excitement couldn't
go for long after Apple India rolled back the price cut decision it made.

Last week, Apple distributors in India made a significant price cut announcement
in iPhone 5S 32GB which is presently priced at Rs 62,500, cutting it down to Rs
49,500. The reason behind taking back the decision is not yet known. Apple
distributor Redington reported in a communication with the dealers on Tuesday
that the Apple new iPhone 5s shipment with new MRP label has been delayed to the
end of October; new prices can only be availed after the stock from Apple is
received.

Earlier 26 September was decided as the launch date for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6
Plus in India on Apple's website which was later changed to 17 October and then
after some time any detail about the launch date was removed from the website
assuming the reason to be shortage of stock availability. Few days back Apple
announced that it has launched sold 4 million units of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6
Plus on the first day of pre-order with some models getting their delivery dates
in November.

The MRP of iPhone 5s 16GB was cut down to Rs. 44,500 as compared to 53,500
launch price. However 16GB iPhone 5s was seen available online for between Rs.
35,000 and Rs. 40,000 for quite sometime.
