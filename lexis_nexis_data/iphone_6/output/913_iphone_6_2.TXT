after customers complained the new mobile phone model was too flexible.

The pair shared the clip of their antics on YouTube but removed it after online
commentators pointed out they could be prosecuted for criminal damage.

In the video, which is still available to watch online through other websites,
one of the boys turns to the camera and speaks about their visit to the Apple
store.

He describes breaking one of the store's phones, saying: "We went into the Apple
store and bent the iPhone 6 plus. We did speak to one of the Apple people and he
said the iPhone 6 cannot be bent.

"I asked him about it - but he said 'No, it cannot be bent, it's a rumour'.

"But we proved that the screen did pop out - we did have to push it back in as
there was a lot of people there and if we got caught we'd end up paying for the
phone. So we had to get out of there quite quick."

It was not immediately clear which store the pair targeted for their stunt.

Apple refused to comment on the video but reissued a statement they released
last week rebuffing criticisms of the iPhone 6's apparent flexibility.

A spokesman said: "Our iPhones are designed, engineered and manufactured to be
both beautiful and sturdy. With normal use a bend in iPhone is extremely rare
and through our first six days of sale, a total ofÂ nine customers have contacted
Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus. As with any Apple product, if you have
questions please contact Apple."
