Nowhereelse. The website has leaked a video of a 'dummy' iPhone 6 handset
revealing this phone to be thin at 6mm.

Earlier the same website posted protective shells that will soon be marketed by
Chinese prop for the iPhone 6. This case measured as a fit for 4.7 inch phone
with buttons placed on both left and right side, instead of left side as in
iPhone 5S. There was one button on the right side while two on the left side.
These was a space above the volume rocker, probably for a USB/lightening
connector.

This time, the dummy has leaked showing a thinner look, which in a way
consolidates the rumours of a thinner and lighter 2mm battery inside the pack.
"It confirms the thickness of 6mm, which was recently suggested by a schematic
plan", the news report says. (via Google translate)

According to a report in DailyMail today, earlier this month, a Japanese
magazine has published drawings of what purported to be a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch
iPhone 6C. The use of product code 6C intrigues us. Like the iPhone 5C and
iPhone 5S (in 2013) after the iPhone 5 in year 2012, are we going to witness
iPhone 6C and and 6S this year?

Since Apple is rumoured to launch two phone of different display sizes in two
events - one in August and another in September this could be a possibility. A
report in Reuteres earlier in May this year pointed at an iPhone 6 with 4.7 inch
display screen at a launch event in August (at least a month earlier than its
usual launch time every year) while the a 5.5 inch or 5.6 inch display screen
model could see a launch in September.

Another leaked information earlier pointed at a waterproof model of the upcoming
phone.
