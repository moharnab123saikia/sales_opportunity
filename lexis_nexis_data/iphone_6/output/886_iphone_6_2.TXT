no further than the humble iPod touch.

Leaked plans of the iPhone 6 - which are coming so thick and fast that now there
are even drawings purporting to be directly from the phone's manufacturer,
Foxconn - all seem to point to the fact the phone will be very similar to an
iPod touch, only larger.

The first iPhone 6 is expected to have a 4.7-inch screen, compared with the mere
4.0 inch screen on the iPod touch. And, of course, it will be a phone rather
than a music/video/games player. But apart from that, they're identical.

The Italian Mac fan site Macitynet.it, which last week brought us a comparison
of the iPhone 6 and Samsung's Galaxy S5, has this week photographed a mock-up of
the iPhone 6, manufactured from the leaked plans, next to a fifth-generation
iPod touch.

As you can see, t The similarities are striking.

The shells are similar. The buttons are the same. The speaker holes are almost
identical.

Gone are the sharp, squared off edges of the past few iPhone designs. In their
place are rounded edges like on the iPod, only even more rounded.

If Apple hadn't itself designed the iPhone 6, I'd say it should sue the designer
for copying its iconic iPod design.
