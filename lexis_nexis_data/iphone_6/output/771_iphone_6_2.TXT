the first weekend. However, the real game changer from Apple may still be in the
offing. Apple is said to be working on an iPhone with a 4.8-inch screen, a 20%
increase in screen size from the iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C and iPhone 5.

Jeffries analyst Peter Misek has issued a research note to investors where he
cited supply chain sources in China claiming that Apple will unveil an iPhone
with 4.8-inch screen. This model is scheduled to be launched in September next
year and will be named iPhone 6, said Misek.

His sources also said that Apple is getting favourable pricing for components
from suppliers. He also raised his rating for Apple shares from Hold to Buy,
increasing the price target from $450 to $600.

Misek in his research note wrote, "We think the 85 million iPhones eligible for
an upgrade when the iPhone 6 launches (we think Apple is targeting Sep 2014)
could be boosted by another 5-10 million from people who skipped the iPhone
5S/5C cycle."

He also revealed that iPhone 5C is facing weak demand in the market. Thus, Apple
has slashed manufacturing volumes of the cheaper model from 30 million to 15
million.

Earlier reports by The Wall Street Journal and KGI securities analyst Ming-chi
Kuo have claimed that the next iPhone will have a 4.8-inch display. WSJ has also
reported that Apple is simultaneously testing an iPhone with a 6-inch screen.
