Nigeria today (November 14), Globacom has assured its teeming subscribers,
especially the thousands of personalities who pre-ordered the handsets, of
adequate stock of the authentic iconic phones.

An earlier statement from the telecommunications company promised to be the
first to make genuine iPhones available to Nigerians who they advised to
purchase their iPhones from Gloworld shops and retail outlets across the country
in order to enjoy the one year warranty from Apple and other mouth-watering
offers which Glo is attaching to two variants of the phones.

This promise to be the first to make the devices officially available led to
Globacom opening its flagship Gloworld outlet on Adeola Odeku, Victoria Island,
Lagos, at midnight to sell the devices to expectant customers.

"Nigerians should get their authentic Apple iPhone and iPhone Plus from Globacom
at the right price, assured quality and great data bundle offers backed up by
Glo 3G high speed internet. Our shop opened from midnight today and will
continue selling the devices in her outlets."

to cater for those who are eager to be the first to own the iPhone 6 on Friday,
November 14 2014", the statement stressed.

It added that "people do not have to ask friends who travel abroad to buy
authentic iPhones for them, or buy fake iPhones from illegal vendors as Apple
has licensed and equipped Globacom to sell authentic iPhones to the good people
of the country. Those who purchase their iPhones from illegal vendors will not
enjoy the warranty from Apple."
