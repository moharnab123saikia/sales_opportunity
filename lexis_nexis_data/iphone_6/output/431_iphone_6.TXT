that the device would be able to run software in landscape mode to offer an
iPad-like user-interface. This set of photos has been leaked by proficient
leakser 9to5 Mac a day ahead of Apple's unveiling of its much awaited bigger
iPhone 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch variants, which are rumored to be called as the
Iphone 6 Air and iPhone 6 Pro respectively.

These screenshots have been tipped by developer Steven Troughton-Smith, who
changed the setting the iOS simulator to 736x414 pixels (1,472x828 at 2x, or
2,208x1242 at 3x), which is rumored to be the resolution for one of the two
iPhone 6 models. And while the iPhone 6 Air with 4.7-inch is expected to work
like the iPhone 5S however with a bigger display, it is the 5.5-inch variant of
the next gen iPhone that is more likely to accommodate this resolution and offer
a dual-pane interface with an iPad-like landscape orientation.

With the landscape interface, the bigger iPhone would offer a more productive
interface, as it might let a user see everything on the Calendar app to be
displayed in a single page, or allow individual contact cards to be seen
alongside full contacts list.

While this landscape mode will make more sense on the 5.5-inch model, we wait
for Apple to take the wraps off its new iPhones and confirm this feature.
Meanwhile, we will keep you updated of any major rumor around the iPhone 6 and
iWatch.
