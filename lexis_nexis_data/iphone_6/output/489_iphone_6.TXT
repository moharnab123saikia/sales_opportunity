next iPhone might look like. Launch dates presumed to be some time mid-September

If industry sources are to be believed, Apple enthusiasts can expect the launch
of the next iPhone as early as September 25.

Apple Insider reported on Thursday, quoting a Chinese language website, that
Apple might announce the iPhone 6 by September 15, ten days ahead of formally
launching it in the first group of countries.

Apple Insider, however, has its doubts, considering that Apple has always
launched a product on a Friday and September 25 is a Thursday. Price-wise, the
4.7-inch iPhone 6, a 32 GB model, is speculated to cost around $850.

iPhone Air?

Another rumour that has taken the internet with a frenzy is talks of a new
5.5-inch "phablet" version of the next iPhone being dubbed the 'iPhone Air'.
Mockups of this alleged new phone that have already surfaced all over the
internet, show a sleeker gadget with a larger screen and rounded edges,
competing with the likes of HTC One.

This sleeker version of the iPhone, if true, is pegged to cost the user around
around $1000. iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone phablet are both expected to have
similar specs.

Earlier, French website Nowwhereelse.fr had shown 'leaked' images of what is
presumably the new iPhone 6 battery, which they claim to be sourced from a
Taiwanese website
