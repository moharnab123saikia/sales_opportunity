The battle of the smartphones: iPhone vs. Pixel

The smartphone market evolves at the blink of an eye and the long-standing,

dominant players are getting ready to battle it out on the field. Keeping to the

trend of launching new and innovative products and services, Google recently

launched its new series of smartphones - Pixel. Marking a clear break from their

much sought-after Nexus series, the new range of Pixel phones have prospective

users excited about its highly advanced features - both internal and external -

that are sure to give its major opponents like Apple and Samsung the competition

of a lifetime.



The multi-billion dollar conglomerate has been releasing a series of new

products, which include Google Allo and Google Trips, which have the majority of

the market tilting towards its favour. But Apple is quick to keep up and release

its own set of products with modified features to lure these very same people

back into its lair. The flaming battle between Apple and Android loyalists has

led to many virtual showdowns, but the real question comes down to which of the

two's recent releases fares better in the market - the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus or

the Google Pixel?



Although we do not profess loyalty towards any one company over the other,

here's why we think that Apple's iPhone fares better than the Google Pixel.



Design



Although both the Google Pixel and the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus smartphones look

similar in terms of polishing, there are some factors in which the latter

outperforms the former. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have their home buttons at the

bottom of the front screen, and the iPhone 7 weighs a good 20 grams lighter than

the Pixel phone, making it lighter on the pocket (only literally). The new set

of iPhones comes in a variety of unique colours like Jet Black, Matte Black,

Silver, Gold and Rose Gold. The Pixel phones, on the other hand, appear only in

three shades - 'Quite Black', 'Very Silver' and 'Really Blue'.



Water resistance



The natural klutzes that we are, we often get caught in the rain with our phones

in our pockets, or we unconsciously place them on wet counter-tops, only to

realise this after some serious damage. Here, too, Apple traced consumer

behaviour and made the new series water-proof, sparing us the trouble of waiting

for hours and spending a fortune on getting our phones repaired at the service

store. However, Pixel does not offer the same luxury and offers no safeguard to

everyday damages to the smartphone.



Raw power



The iPhone 7 uses a superior A10 fusion processor that the company boasts of as

being "the most powerful chip ever used in a smartphone". According to various

benchmark tests, the A10 processor offers a significantly higher single-core

performance among its competition and a modestly enhanced multi-core

performance. With official records stating that this makes the iPhone 7 and 7

Plus twice as fast as the iPhone 6, the former seems to have an edge in the

market when it comes to raw power. In comparison, the Google Pixel carries a

Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 system-on-a-chip, which, though the company promises a

10 percent improvement in processing speed over the Snapdragon 820 that

smartphones like the One Plus 3 and the HTC 10 currently support, does not seem

to boast of the same core performance speed as the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.



Storage



The new set of iPhones offers a storage package of 32, 128 and 256 GB compared

to the earlier iPhones that began with the set of 16, 32 and 128 GB. In

comparison, the Google Pixel offers a storage package of 32 and 128 GB, tilting

the odds in favour of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, considering the vast amount of

data that everyday users are now privy to save on their devices.



Camera and updates



One of the primary selling features of the iPhone 7 Plus is that it offers a

dual-real-lens camera with a 12 megapixel wide-angle and telephoto features,

with an optical zoom of 2x and digital zoom up to 10x. Although Google Pixel too

offers a 12-megapixel rear camera and has the advantage of an 8-megapixel front

camera, compared to the iPhone's 7-megapixel, it boasts of no dual-lens feature

that has your everyday picture-lovers bouncing in their seats.
