HIGHLIGHT:Â Proof of Concept will be available to developers.





Google is reportedly planning to release its second generation Chromebook Pixel

dubbed Chromebook Pixel 2.



OMG!CHROME! cited Google's Renee Niemi as saying: "We do have a new Pixel coming

out and it will be coming out soon.



"We will be selling it but I just have to set your expectations: this is a

development platform. This is really a proof of concept. We don't make very many

of these -- we really don't."



The report suggests that the company will be making limited units of the new

device which will be sold to developers.



It is likely to have a similar design as that of the Chromebook Pixel, which is

expected to cut additional design and manufacturing costs, reported the

publication.



The first generation Chromebook pixel featured a touch-screen with the highest

pixel density of any laptop and was capable of ruining Ubuntu and Android OS.



The Chromebook Pixel 2 will have 12.85-inch screen and is likely to feature

reversible 'Type-C' USB ports, which is expected to provide up to 10 Gbps of

data transfer speed.



It is also likely to feature an interactive lightbar, backlit keyboard and other

premium niceties, and is expected to be powered by Intel's new Skylake chip.
