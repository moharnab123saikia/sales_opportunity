According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
tileable display panel includes a screen layer, a display layer, and an
illumination layer. The display layer includes a plurality of transmissive
pixels to collectively project a unified image onto the backside of the screen
layer. The transmissive pixels disposed within a perimeter region of the display
layer have smaller transmission apertures than the transmissive pixels disposed
within a central region of the display layer. The illumination layer generates
lamp light to illuminate a backside of the display layer. The illumination layer
is coupled to generate the lamp light incident on the backside of the display
layer in the perimeter region with greater divergence than the lamp light
incident on the backside of the display layer in the central region."
