According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A

tileable display panel includes a screen layer, a display layer, and an

illumination layer. The display layer includes a plurality of transmissive

pixels to collectively project a unified image onto the backside of the screen

layer. The transmissive pixels disposed within a perimeter region of the display

layer have smaller transmission apertures than the transmissive pixels disposed

within a central region of the display layer. The illumination layer generates

lamp light to illuminate a backside of the display layer. The illumination layer

is coupled to generate the lamp light incident on the backside of the display

layer in the perimeter region with greater divergence than the lamp light

incident on the backside of the display layer in the central region."
