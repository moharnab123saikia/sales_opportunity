LENGTH: 192  words



DATELINE: Washington





Marketing Research Association has issued the following news release:



Google has revamped its logo much to the excitement of a small number of design

geeks, moving the second 'g' a whopping one pixel to the right and taking the

'l' on a wild journey one pixel down and one to the right.

The minuscule change was spotted by eagle-eyed Redditors, with the fact that it

was even picked up on being testament to the brand's power and omnipresence.



The change basically comes down to kerning, with Google adjusting the letters to

improve the logo's readability and decipherability.



Also, the bottoms of the 'l' and 'e' previously didn't line up, which presumably

left some employees in the company's design department weeping at their desks.
