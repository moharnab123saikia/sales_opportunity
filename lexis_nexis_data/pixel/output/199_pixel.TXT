Has Google finally hit the smartphone jackpot?



Shares of Google/Alphabet are trading at record highs after many positive

reviews of the companycs new Pixel phone were published Tuesday.



Among the fans of the new phone, which is the first to be designed by Google, is

longtime tech guru Walt Mossberg, who called it ceasily the best Android phonec

he has tested.



cIn its first try, Google has landed itself in the same class as Applecs iPhone

and the Samsung Galaxy S7 (that companycs non-exploding model),c Mossberg wrote

for the Verge .



The Wall Street Journalcs Joanna Stern : cThe Google Pixel is now the best

Android smartphone you can buy.cThe other leading contender was disqualified due

to spontaneous combustion. c (Shecs talking about Samsungcs Galaxy Note 7, which

is no longer being made because of batteries that overheated and caught fire.)



The Pixel is manufactured by HTC, but Mossberg notes that unlike with the Nexus,

Google designed the hardware, software and cloud ecosystem for it   an

Apple-like move that he says will cshake up the industry.c While the Pixel is

only being carried by Verizon in the U.S., it appears investors are excited

about the possibilities.



Google shares are up $5.30 to $826.79 as of this post. They closed at $821.49

Tuesday. At least one analyst, Youssef Squali, of Cantor Fitzgerald, thinks

their rise can also be attributed to chope from a strong quarter from all

internet companies.c Google reports earnings next week.
