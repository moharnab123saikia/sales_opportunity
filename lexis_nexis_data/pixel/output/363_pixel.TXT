

Google has had a virtual reality headset on the market for a few years - but
it's basically a £13 piece of cardboard .

But today the gigantic technology company unveiled a brand new headset called
Daydream View.

It's more than just a piece of card - instead it's closer to Samsung's Gear VR
headset. But rather than being made out of plastic, it's crafted from fabric
more akin to sportswear.

Google says the Daydream View is 30% lighter than similar headsets.

Of course, it still requires a smartphone to work and Google is no doubt hoping
you'll pair it up with one of its two new Pixel phones .

new Android smartphones

The Daydream View headset comes with a small remote control that works a bit
like the remote sticks for the Nintendo Wii. It tracks motion control and can be
used for navigation and gameplay.

Inside the remote are sensors that respond to the way you move. Google says it's
so precise you can even write with it.

There's going to be quite a few apps that work with the Daydream View headset as
well. Google first announced the platform at its I/O developer conference back
in May.

The platform will be optimised to run on a number of Android smartphones -
including those from manufacturers like Samsung, Huawei and HTC.

But Google still pointed out that its new Pixel phones are the first that are
"Daydream ready".

The headset will come in a choice of three colours: Slate, Snow and Crimson.
It's set to launch in early November in the UK for £69.
