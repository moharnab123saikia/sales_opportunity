Galaxy S7 edge can charge much faster than Google Pixel XL or an iPhone 7 Plus

In a smartphone battery charging test speed results, Galaxy S7 edge is able to

get the better of both Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus



One popular YouTuber who goes by the name of SuperSaf TV has made a video of a

speed charging test between Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge, iPhone 7 Plus and the

Google Pixel XL. To bring you to a recap of the battery capacities of each

phablet, Galaxy S7 edge features the biggest cell, at 3,600mAh, followed by the

Pixel XL at 3,450mAh and iPhone 7 Plus at 2,900mAh.



However, despite sporting the largest battery in comparison to the remaining two

handsets, Galaxy S7 edge still manages to charge the battery much faster than

the remaining two flagships. To start a fair comparison between all three

smartphones, all three were started from 1% battery life with all three phones

having Wi-Fi disabled and set on airplane mode. All three phones were also using

their own chargers that came bundled with the phone's packaging. If there were

different chargers used, the results obtained would have been much different.



Looking at the video, Galaxy S7 edge is the clear winner here most likely

because the smartphone's charger delivers more amperage compared to the

remaining two. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take a long time to charge

because Apple has continued to ship its iPhones with 5W chargers, thus

increasing the overall time it takes for the battery capacity to reach its

maximum level.



Galaxy S7 edge also supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0, which dramatically

decreases the total battery charging time, which you can evidently see in the

video posted above. Google Pixel XL happily accepted second place, which is

disappointing because it doesn't feature premium features despite carrying an

expensive price of $649 for the base model. Galaxy S7 edge also features a

wireless charging feature, making it an even better smartphone if you're looking

for a handset that provides you with a ton of options for your money.
