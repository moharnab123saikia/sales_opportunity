OS. The new open source operating system could go live as early as the third
quarter of 2017.

Android blog Android Police reports that Andromeda will debut on the
next-generation Pixel notebook. Presently codenamed "Bison," the said hardware
is likely to go official as the Pixel 3. This would finally showcase the highly
anticipated efforts by Google's Pixel team in collaboration with Android and
Chrome OS engineers.

Google recently brought its Play store to Chrome OS to offer a large number of
Android apps directly on Chromebooks. However, that tweak within the web-based
platform didn't influence the masses, and many customers are still opting for a
Windows-running laptop or a macOS-powered MacBook. The search giant is thus
apparently in development to release an entirely new combination that can take
on Windows as well as macOS through its powerpack features.

It was initially rumoured that Google would completely merge Chrome OS with
Android and develop a unified solution for smartphones and tablets. But
considering the forthcoming event where the search giant is speculated to launch
Pixel phones, that merge would not have a direct presence on smartphones.

The blog claims that the very first Andromeda device will come as an "ultra-thin
laptop" with a 12.3-inch display and have the latest USB-C ports. Also, the
hardware is expected to be powered by either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor
with 32GB or 128GB of storage and up to 16GB of RAM.

Google is yet to reveal details about the development of Andromeda. Meanwhile,
the tech world is anticipating Android 7.1 running Pixel smartphones that are
likely to be unveiled on October 4. That same event would also set the stage for
the new platform development.
