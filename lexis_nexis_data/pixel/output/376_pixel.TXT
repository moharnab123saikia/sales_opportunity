Google is reportedly all set to launch Andromeda as a mix of Android and Chrome

OS. The new open source operating system could go live as early as the third

quarter of 2017.



Android blog Android Police reports that Andromeda will debut on the

next-generation Pixel notebook. Presently codenamed "Bison," the said hardware

is likely to go official as the Pixel 3. This would finally showcase the highly

anticipated efforts by Google's Pixel team in collaboration with Android and

Chrome OS engineers.



Google recently brought its Play store to Chrome OS to offer a large number of

Android apps directly on Chromebooks. However, that tweak within the web-based

platform didn't influence the masses, and many customers are still opting for a

Windows-running laptop or a macOS-powered MacBook. The search giant is thus

apparently in development to release an entirely new combination that can take

on Windows as well as macOS through its powerpack features.



It was initially rumoured that Google would completely merge Chrome OS with

Android and develop a unified solution for smartphones and tablets. But

considering the forthcoming event where the search giant is speculated to launch

Pixel phones, that merge would not have a direct presence on smartphones.



The blog claims that the very first Andromeda device will come as an "ultra-thin

laptop" with a 12.3-inch display and have the latest USB-C ports. Also, the

hardware is expected to be powered by either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor

with 32GB or 128GB of storage and up to 16GB of RAM.



Google is yet to reveal details about the development of Andromeda. Meanwhile,

the tech world is anticipating Android 7.1 running Pixel smartphones that are

likely to be unveiled on October 4. That same event would also set the stage for

the new platform development.
