The 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel will be priced at over (EURO)700 and come
with specifications to match top handsets from Samsung, Apple, Sony and Huawei.

Both phones have 12-megapixel cameras with optical stabilisation and an f2.0
lens. Google claims that the camera has the best industry technical score
(DxoMark Mobile) of any smartphone.

They also have 32GB of storage memory and a bigger battery than the iPhone 7.
Both phones have a free tech support function directly from the device. Both the
Pixel and Pixel XL have a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone.

At over (EURO)700 each, Google is pursuing a premium pricing strategy for the
new phones in contrast to the aggressive pricing it adopted for its Nexus line
of phones. The phones are to be launched in the US soon, while availability in
Ireland is expected to be announced later. Google also launched a new smarthome
voice control unit called Home. The device is being marketed as a rival to
Amazon's voice-controlled Echo home gadget, which has proven to be a hit in the
US.

The company also announced a new ultra high definition streaming device to link
smartphones and tablets to 4K televisions as well as a virtual reality headset
called Daydream View.

Shares in Google, Samsung and Apple remained unchanged after the product
announcements.
