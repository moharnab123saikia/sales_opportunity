Sep. 7--See that white spot on Google Earth? Thanks to Decatur employees of

United Launch Alliance, it could be your poodle.



A Decatur-made Delta II rocket on Saturday launched GeoEye-1, the world's

highest-resolution commercial imaging satellite.



Google has an exclusive contract with GeoEye, stipulating it will not sell its

images to any other mapping Web sites.



The $209 million satellite weighs 4,300 pounds. It will take color images of the

Earth from 425 miles in space while moving at about 16,000 mph.



The satellite is capable of taking images at a resolution of 0.41 meters per

pixel, but U.S. law limits Google to 0.5 meters per pixel.



A 12-story-tall Delta II 7420-10 configuration rocket launched the GeoEye-1 into

a near-polar orbit.



Liftoff was at 1:50 p.m. CDT from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the Central

California coast.



Video on the Web site of Boeing, a partner in ULA, showed the rocket jettisoning

solid rocket motors and then the separation of the first stage.



Google, ULA and Boeing decals were on Stage 1.



The company says the satellite's imaging services will be sold for uses that

could range from environmental mapping to agriculture and defense. One of its

customers is the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which helped finance

the construction and launch.



ULA employs about 650 workers in Decatur. The plant assembles the Delta II and

Delta IV rockets. It recently began construction of a warehouse for rocket

inventory that will clear space for construction of the Atlas V.
