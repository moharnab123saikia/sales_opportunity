virtual reality and smart home devices.

The handset will slip into a headset to transport users into a new world, which
might be the flight deck of a spaceship or the audience for a Rihanna concert.

Google is due to unveil the Pixel, pictured, at an event in San Francisco.
However, some details appear to have been inadvertently leaked by Carphone
Warehouse. It is thought there will be a Pixel with a 5in screen and a 5.5in
Pixel XL.

The Pixel, whose price and launch date are to be announced, will challenge the
iPhone from Apple and Samsung Galaxy devices. Along with the phone will be a
voicecontrolled personal assistant service. It is thought the Pixel will work
with a home hub and smart speaker system to let users talk to the internet,
rather than using keyboards and touchscreens, and control smart household
appliances.

The Pixel will be at the heart of the Google Daydream virtual reality platform.
It is thought the phone and headset will come with a remote control for users to
navigate their way through virtual worlds.
