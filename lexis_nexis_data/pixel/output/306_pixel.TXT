

Google is set to launch its latest smartphone line-up next week.

However, a leaked photo of what is said to be one of the the new devices has
been doing the rounds of late. The leaked photo does not reveal much about the
phone other than that it employs a bone stock Android interface and features a
simplistic body design that borrows heavily from Google's older Nexus devices.

Dubbed Pixel, Google's new smartphone line-up comes in after the tech giant
decided to drop its Nexus branding. Google will reveal two smartphones, Pixel
and Pixel XL at its October 4 event along with other hardware.

Google smartphone expected at Oct 4 event

Reports suggest that the phone features a 5-inch 1080p display, a quad-core
2.0GHz 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a 2,770 mAh battery, a
12MP rear camera, and an 8MP front camera. It has also been reported that users
can expect a top-mounted headphone jack, a fingerprint scanner on the rear and a
USB-C port on the bottom. The Pixel XL is also said to feature the same
specifications barring a bigger 5.5 inch screen and a 3,450 mAh battery.

Google teases with mysterious ads ahead of October 4 launch

Google hasn't said much about the upcoming event. Nevertheless, it has employed
an aggressive marketing strategy by installing building-sized adverts trailing
the event and pictures of a statue in Brooklyn Bridge Park.

How the new smartphone actually looks we'll only know for sure once Google
unveils it at the October 4 event.
