LENGTH: 242  words





This will be the second ever touch screen Chromebook to be launched after the

Google Chromebook Pixel.



Saturday, November 16, 2013: After launching its C720-2484 Chromebook earlier,

Acer is reportedly planning to extend its line of Google Chromebook devices. The

company is reportedly going to launch the second ever touch screen Chromebook

device. The only other device in this segment is the Google Chromebook pixel.

According to reports, Acer's touch screen device was seen on Amazon France and

has the model number C720P-29552G03aii.



The device is reportedly available on pre order right now at a price of 299, but

it should be announced soon by the company. The device will have a 29.4-cm

(11.6-inch) touch screen display and will be powered by a 1.4 GHz Intel Celeron

processor. This could be a Haswell-based processor as well. It is available with

2 GB of RAM and a 32 GB SSD for data storage.



The device seems pretty similar to the C720 Chromebook that Acer already has

doing the rounds in the market. Apart from the touch screen, the only other

difference between the two devices is in the RAM and the SSD storage. While no

official comment has been made by Acer, it is possible that the company will

launch more such devices.



The key specifications of the Acer C720P-29552G03aii are as follow.



* Weight: 1.2 Kg



* Screen Size: 11.6 inches



* Intel Celeron 1.4 GHz dual-core processor



* 2GB of RAM, 32GB SSD



* Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n



* USB 2.0, 3.0 ports, HDMI out
