

If you stayed up for Apple's iPad mini announcement last Wednesday morning
(Singapore time), the screen-size comparison the company made between its new
7.9-inch tablet and the 7-inch Google Nexus 7 might seem puzzling.

It seemed as if Apple was saying the larger screen size is one of the reasons
its new tablet is superior.

By its own definition, every phone that is larger than Apple's new 4-inch iPhone
5, such as the 4.8-inch Samsung Galaxy S III, has to be superior.

Digital Life takes a closer look at the claims made by Apple's senior
vice-president of worldwide marketing, Mr Phil Schiller.

Price

iPad mini: $448

Nexus 7: $399

Asus is selling the Nexus 7 here at a slightly higher price than in the United
States (where it is US$249, or S$304), which means that in Singapore, the iPad
mini costs only $49 more.

If the comparison is based on price and size, $49 more gets you 0.9inches more
display.

Display

iPad mini: 7.9inches

Nexus 7: 7inches

The 29.6 square inches of space of the iPad mini is bigger than the
21.9squareinches of the Nexus 7, but let us look at the form factor.

The Nexus 7 uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is better for watching movies and
videos as they are usually produced in that format.

With the 4:3 ratio of the iPad mini, users will end up with black bars above and
below video clips.

Resolution

iPad mini: 1,024 x 768 pixels

Nexus 7: 1,280 x 800 pixels

Apple's famed retina display is absent and the iPad mini's screen sports 1,024 x
768 pixels, with a pixel per inch density of 163.

The Nexus 7's screen offers 1,280x800 pixels, with a higher pixel density of
216.

This means that while the mini has a bigger screen, the Nexus 7 has a much
sharper one.

Processor

iPad mini: 1GHz dual-core A5

Nexus 7: 1.3GHz Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor chip

The iPad mini uses the 1GHz dual-core A5 - the same one used in the iPad 2,
which was first launched last March.

The Nexus 7 uses the latest Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor chip, running at
1.3GHz.

Cameras

iPad mini: Two (front and rear)

Nexus 7: One (rear)

The mini has a 5-megapixel (MP) rear camera, and a 1.2MP front one.

The Nexus 7 has only a much weaker 1.2MP rear camera.

Wireless

iPad mini: Wi-Fi and 4G LTE

Nexus 7: Wi-Fi only

The Nexus 7 is currently only available in Wi-Fi, whereas the iPad mini offers
both Wi-Fi and 4G LTE.

But note that while local telcos support both 1,800MHz and 2,600MHz LTE bands,
Apple's LTE chip only supports the 1,800MHz frequency.
