Wednesday, December 11, 2013: LG has reportedly launched the Google Play edition
of its G Pad 8.3 tablet. According to reports, the Google Play edition of the
South Korean electronics giant's tablet will come with the Android KitKat
operating system. Just like any other Google Play edition device, this will also
bring a pure Android experience for the KitKat operating system, without the
usual Optimus user interface that comes in these LG devices. Further, the tablet
will get priority in terms of the updates that it gets from Google.

The device is reportedly selling in the US already for $350. The G Pad 8.3 has
an IPS LCD display along with a 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution. It is powered by a
1.7 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor with 2 GB of RAM. In addition, the
device has a 5 mega pixel rear camera and a 1.3 mega pixel front camera. The
rear camera can record videos at 1080 pixel resolutions.

LG has reportedly also added a 4,600 mAh battery in the tablet and the device
weighs a total of 338 grams. It is 8.3-mm thin and will be available in Indigo
Black colour. It's a competitor for the Apple iPad Mini with Retina Display.
