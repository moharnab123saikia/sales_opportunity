Thursday, December 05, 2013: The Xolo Play Tegra Note tablet is available on
e-commerce portal, Flipkart. The device has been listed at a price tag of Rs
18,990 by the retailer. No official launch has been made by Xolo yet though and
the company hasn't given an official word either. Being listed on Flipkart
though shows that the official launch for the device could also be around the
corner.

The Tegra Note tablet by Xolo was expected in the country around this time only.
The device is powered by a 1.8 GHz nVidia Tegra 4 processor along with a 17.7-cm
(7-inch) 1280 x 800 pixel display and 16 GB of internal storage, which can be
extended using a micro-SD card slot. It also has a 5 mega pixel rear camera and
a VGA front camera. The device runs the Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean operating
system and has 1 GB of RAM.

The device is in direct competition with the Nexus 7 by Google, which was
officially released in India today. The Nexus 7 is priced at Rs 20,999 in the
country, which is about Rs 2,000 above the Xolo tablet. Unlike the Xolo tablet
though, the Nexus 7 does not support a stylus.
