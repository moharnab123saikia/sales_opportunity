everyone waited excitedly for the Nexus successors to be unveiled, the company
on October 4th announced the Pixel duo at an overwhelming price point, which
turned out to be almost double that of a Nexus. Google Pixel 32GB black color
variant will go the cheapest at Rs 57,000. The smartphone has a 5-inch display,
world's top end Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset and also, supposedly, the best
camera a smartphone could ever have.
