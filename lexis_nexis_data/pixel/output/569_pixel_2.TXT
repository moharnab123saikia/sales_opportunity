Since its launch, Google's pixel smartphones have grabbed a lot of attention. As

everyone waited excitedly for the Nexus successors to be unveiled, the company

on October 4th announced the Pixel duo at an overwhelming price point, which

turned out to be almost double that of a Nexus. Google Pixel 32GB black color

variant will go the cheapest at Rs 57,000. The smartphone has a 5-inch display,

world's top end Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset and also, supposedly, the best

camera a smartphone could ever have.
