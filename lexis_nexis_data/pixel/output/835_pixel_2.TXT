AJon Ellis, Mad About Pixels director, has launched a new initiative to give
businesses a strong presence on Google to make the most of Hull's recent
successes and will not charge a monthly search engine optimisation (SEO) fee if
it is not meeting targets.

QWhere did it    come from?

AMr Ellis developed the idea for businesses to develop the SEO initiative after
the city's success. He said: "The city is already gaining excellent exposure in
the media and that will substantially increase as we approach 2017. Thousands of
people will be going online to discover more about Hull and it presents a
wonderful chance  for local businesses to raise awareness about their products
and services. It will be vital for businesses to have a strong presence on
Google but if they are not on page one they could miss out."

QWhat happens   next?

AMad About Pixels plans to get as many businesses on page one of a Google search
as it can, while making it as easy and as cost-effective as possible. Mr Ellis
said: "Once they are on page one they will generate more business, which will
increase revenue."
