THE first Google Pixel smartphones went on sale in London today - with

enthusiasts queuing from 6am to snap one up.



Shoppers and Google staff packed into a pop-up store inside Currys PC World in

Tottenham Court Road to try out the much-hyped handset.



Londoner Rabi Rafi, 19, was first in the queue after getting up at 5am to ensure

his place, saying he had "not been this excited in a while".



The Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phones to feature Google Assistant and

claim day-long battery life, plus a seven-hour charge after being plugged in for

just 15 minutes.



The 5-inch Pixel costs £599 and the XL an extra £120. Both are available in

silver or black, with either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage.



Also today, camera giant Kodak announced plans to unveil its new smartphone -

which is aimed at photography enthusiasts and which it says has two

"industry-leading" cameras built in.



The Kodak Ektra will house a 21-megapixel rear camera as well as a 13-megapixel

front-facing camera. It goes on sale in the UK in December for £449.
