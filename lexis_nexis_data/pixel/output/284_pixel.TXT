After numerous leaks, Google has finally unveiled its Pixel smartphone.
According to the search-giant, it is the first phone made inside and out by the
company. Google claims that the goal of Nexus program was to work closely with
mobile handset partners around the world to deliver the best of Android. Pixel
is the next step to bring the hardware and software design together under one
roof.

Made of premium glass and metals, this device is supposed to take on the iPhpne
7 duo. The only problem is that compared to Apple's latest phones, the Pixel's
back looks quite repulsive. Seriously, why on Earth would you experiment with
the glossy and matte surface on a single side?

As far as the specifications are concerned, you get a 5-inch Full HD AMOLED
screen. It is powered by a quad-core Snapdragon 821 chipset and has 4 GB RAM.
Although the phone isn't available at this point, Google claims that the Pixel
"the highest rated smartphone camera. Ever." What you get here is a 12-megapixel
rear camera that lacks OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation). Instead it makes do
with EIS (Electronic Image Stabilisation) that's mostly found in budget or
mid-range phones.

Highest rated camera. Ever! On a phone that's not even released.

The Pixel comes with a fingerprint sensor. Other features include 4G VoLTE,
Wi-Fi , Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, USB Type-C, and 2770 mAh battery. On the software
side of the things, you get the latest Android 7.1 Nougat. Starting today, the
Pixel will be up for pre-order in the US, Canada, Germany, and Australia. The 32
GB base variant is priced at $649 (approx Rs 43,000), whereas the 128 GB model
costs $749 (approx Rs 50,000).
