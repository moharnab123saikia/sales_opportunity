Google's first premium handset is set to take on the iPhone 7.



After numerous leaks, Google has finally unveiled its Pixel smartphone.

According to the search-giant, it is the first phone made inside and out by the

company. Google claims that the goal of Nexus program was to work closely with

mobile handset partners around the world to deliver the best of Android. Pixel

is the next step to bring the hardware and software design together under one

roof.



Made of premium glass and metals, this device is supposed to take on the iPhpne

7 duo. The only problem is that compared to Apple's latest phones, the Pixel's

back looks quite repulsive. Seriously, why on Earth would you experiment with

the glossy and matte surface on a single side?



As far as the specifications are concerned, you get a 5-inch Full HD AMOLED

screen. It is powered by a quad-core Snapdragon 821 chipset and has 4 GB RAM.

Although the phone isn't available at this point, Google claims that the Pixel

"the highest rated smartphone camera. Ever." What you get here is a 12-megapixel

rear camera that lacks OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation). Instead it makes do

with EIS (Electronic Image Stabilisation) that's mostly found in budget or

mid-range phones.



Highest rated camera. Ever! On a phone that's not even released.



The Pixel comes with a fingerprint sensor. Other features include 4G VoLTE,

Wi-Fi , Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, USB Type-C, and 2770 mAh battery. On the software

side of the things, you get the latest Android 7.1 Nougat. Starting today, the

Pixel will be up for pre-order in the US, Canada, Germany, and Australia. The 32

GB base variant is priced at $649 (approx Rs 43,000), whereas the 128 GB model

costs $749 (approx Rs 50,000).
