Google in dreamtime Optus deal chases Apple's monster

OPTUS has taken the wraps off Google's first mobile phone -- but the ``HTC

Dream'' could turn into a nightmare for the big telco.



Experts say the highly anticipated phone, built by Taiwanese brand HTC, won't

take sales away from Apple's popular iPhone 3G, despite having some amazing new

features.



What could be even more depressing for Optus are internet reports that the first

version of the HTC Dream (also called the G1) could be outdated by a series 2

Google mobile that could be unveiled in the US as early as May.



Technology expert Alex Zaharov-Reutt says the deadline for all new smartphones

will be June.



``Everyone is trying to go to market before or at the same time Apple announces

its new iPhone model, which has been June for the last two years,'' Mr

Zaharov-Reutt said.



``So I'd expect we'd see Google's updated Dream phone, rumoured to be called the

G2, in Australia in the lead-up to Christmas.''



On paper the HTC Dream boasts an impressive list of features, headed by Google's

Android open source operating system. But that will mean little to the man in

the street.



``The Dream, like the Blackberry, appeals to Google fans and soccer mums, ''

says The Gadget Guy, Peter Blasina.



``It's a great little organiser and has all of Google's internet tools and

functionality built into it.



``But the iPhone will remain more of an emotional purchase and remains more of

an entertainment device that appeals to a market that looks for something

cool.''



Stylistically, the new HTC Dream G1 is nowhere near as slinky as the iPhone, and

its user interface is not as responsive or as friendly.



Applications loaded into the HTC Dream include YouTube, Google Talk, Gmail,

Google Search and Google Maps. The HTC Dream is exclusive to Optus and is

available on four, 24-month plans from $59 per month.
