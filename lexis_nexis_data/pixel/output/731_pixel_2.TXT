Khimji Information and Communication Technology launched the Motorola Milestone

in Oman last week. With software from Google and hardware from Motorola, this is

the latter's first smartphone in the Middle East powered by Android 2.1.





With this new product, Motorola claims there is no compromise between the

Internet, messaging and the multimedia experience. Enabling this is Milestone's

high resolution 3.7" wide screen offering 854 pixel width display. This allows

easy viewing of web pages, displaying the whole page when browsing as most web

pages are 800 pixels wide.

Further enhancing the experience is its keypad, which is fully Arabic supported.

Motorola claims that the Milestone is the thinnest handset with a full QWERTY

slider - 13.7mm - around today.

Taking the media gathering through the Milestone's various features at the

launch, Harout Bedrossian, sales director of mobile devices, Motorola, said, "We

are back after a year of quiet."

This is when the company innovated to come back with a bang. Motorola has

launched eight Android products globally since Q4 2009.

Among the features in the Milestone that make it stand out are a number of

Google mobile applications, including Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail and

YouTube, integrated into the device.

The Milestone comes fitted with GPS maps of the GCC, North African and some

African countries, allowing voice-enabled turn-by-turn navigation. It also has a

5 megapixel camera, 3G and Wi-Fi connectivity, and 8GB memory inbox which is

expandable to 32GB among other things and is priced at RO259.

On purchase, the Milestone comes with a stereo headset, 8GB card with GCC GPS

maps and a multimedia docking station.

Among those present at the launch were Jayanta G Borpujari, GM of Khimji

Information and Communication Technology, and Pankaj Khimji, director of Khimji

Ramdas, who said, "Technology changes faster than I can change my mussar."
