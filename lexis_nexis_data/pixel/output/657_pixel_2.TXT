
DATELINE: New Delhi


New Delhi, Sept. 27 -- With the 'Made by Google' event to be held on October 4,
Google seems to have new hardware plans for next year. The company plans to
release a new laptop, known by an informal nickname "Pixel 3", which will be the
first ever device to run on the software giant's new Android-Chrome OS, called
Andromeda.


 Google-watcher blog Android Police reports that the device, internally known as
"Bison" will be an ultra-thin laptop with a 12.3" display, but Google also wants
it to support a "tablet" mode. The blog also states that Google's planned
pricing is still competitive: Bison is pegged to start at $799. Powering it will
be either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or
16GB of RAM. This seems to suggest there will be two models, says Android
Police.
 It will also feature a fingerprint scanner, two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm jack, a
host of sensors, stylus support (a Wacom pen will be sold separately), stereo
speakers, quad microphones, and a battery that will last around 10 hours. The
keyboard will be backlit, and the glass trackpad will use haptic and force
detection similar to the MacBook.
 The company plans to announce its Pixel smartphones on October 4, and the 'Made
by Google' event could be the first time we get to see Andromeda and how it
functions.
