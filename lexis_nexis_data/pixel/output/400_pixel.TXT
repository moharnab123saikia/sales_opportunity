Google Pixel phones seen coming in October



LENGTH: 143  words





It seems that Project Ara is not the only thing that Google is dropping this

quarter. The company appears to also be planning to drop the Nexus moniker in

favor of a new brand name for its Android smartphones.



Google is preparing to announce on Oct. 4 its first two smartphones dubbed Pixel

and Pixel XL. The latter will be a 4K-capable Chromcast dongle and Daydream VR

viewer, reports The Next Web.



It is highly likely that these two devices are the ones that HTC built for

Google which were codenamed Sailfish and Marlin.



Apart from new smartphones, Google is also expected to disclose more information

about its Google Home, a voice-activated speaker powered by Google Assistant

that supports Cast for audio streaming.



Google has yet to confirm anything regarding the new Pixel phones, but hopefully

more information will be made available in the coming days.
