quarter. The company appears to also be planning to drop the Nexus moniker in
favor of a new brand name for its Android smartphones.

Google is preparing to announce on Oct. 4 its first two smartphones dubbed Pixel
and Pixel XL. The latter will be a 4K-capable Chromcast dongle and Daydream VR
viewer, reports The Next Web.

It is highly likely that these two devices are the ones that HTC built for
Google which were codenamed Sailfish and Marlin.

Apart from new smartphones, Google is also expected to disclose more information
about its Google Home, a voice-activated speaker powered by Google Assistant
that supports Cast for audio streaming.

Google has yet to confirm anything regarding the new Pixel phones, but hopefully
more information will be made available in the coming days.
