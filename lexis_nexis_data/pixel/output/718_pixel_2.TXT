improved battery saving

Google has made a beta version of its new mobile operating system, Android N,

available to developers on a handful of devices (the Nexus 5X, 6, 6P, 9, the

Nexus Player and the Pixel C), revealing new features such as a multi-window

mode, a simplified notifications system, new options for managing data use and

enhanced battery saving.



The main innovation in Android N, now unveiled in a beta version for developers,

is a split-screen function for using two applications simultaneously, open side

by side (tablet) or one above the other (smartphone). This mode is even more

eagerly awaited since it already features in third-party interfaces for Google's

OS -- like those made by Samsung and LG -- as well as in competitor platforms

iOS and Windows. Developers are being offered a 25% reduction on the Pixel C in

the US Google Store to take full advantage of the new beta OS.



Other new features include revamped notifications, promising a faster and

easier-to-use system no matter what applications are open. Google also promises

improved battery saving, plus options for limiting data use by reducing the

quality of images and video streams, which could prove handy for users with

limited data packages.



Google is expected to present the latest features of its Android mobile

operating system in detail at the Google I/O conference, held in Mountain View,

California, May 18-20, 2016. By giving developers a first look in March, Google

could start rolling out Android N from this summer on a new line-up of Nexus

devices, before quickly following with updates for Android Marshmallow products.

All that remains now is to find a suitable snack to name the OS. Three years

after teaming up with KitKat, could Google have an Android Nutella in store?
