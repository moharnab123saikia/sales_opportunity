and Microsoft's OSes.

Monday, March 03, 2014: HTC is likely to announce its high-end tablet device
later this year. But speculations over the company's new device are rife as a
tablet concept made by @PhoneDesigner has surfaced. The HTC Babel is supposedly
a dual-boot tablet, which will support both Android and Windows operating
systems.

The HTC Babel tablet concept is likely to let users choose between Windows 8
(64-bit) and Android OS. Its design has a clear HTC feel as it is packed with
large speakers on the front, and an aluminum-made case with a dual-boot.

The concept tab made by @Phone Designer, has a display of 25.4-cm (10-inch) with
a 3:2 aspect ratio, and may have 1920 x 1440 or 2560 x 1920 pixel resolution. It
will further have a "native digitizer", a rear camera and a front-facing camera
to load the device.

However, HTC hasn't had a fair market share in the tablet segment, if rumours
are to believed the company may manufacture a high-end Nexus tablet for Google.
This tablet may be released in the second half of the year.
