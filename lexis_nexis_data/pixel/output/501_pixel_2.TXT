Google's upcoming Pixel phones wont be waterproof, but they will be water
resistant, says latest news reports.

According to a source speaking to Android Police, the rumored Pixel and Pixel XL
will be IP53 dust and water resistant - the same level as the HTC 10. The three
in IP53 means that it will be resistant to spraying water, which translates to
"water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60° from the vertical shall have no
harmful effect."

Potentially, this means that you can hold your phone out in the rain, but the
rating does not guarantee protection if it falls into a puddle or the pool,
which is something the new flagships like iPhone 7, Sony Xperia XZ and Samsung
Galaxy S7 Edge are protected against. The rating also means that the phone wont
be able to cope with high pressure water, so running the phone under a tap or in
the shower is out of the question as well.

As of now the phones are still rumors, but it looks like Google will launch them
at an event planned for October 4th, and might hit the shelves on October 21st.
