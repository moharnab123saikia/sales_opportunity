Next OnePlus phone to be as fast as Google Pixel



LENGTH: 249  words





Will the next OnePlus be able to stand up to the likes of the Google Pixel?



OnePlus next phone, rumored to be titled the OnePlus 3T, is set to feature

Qualcomm's cutting edge Snapdragon 821 chipset, which means we might be looking

at a pretty powerful phone.



The OnePlus 3T, which is rumored to be revealed on November 14 will be standing

up against the likes of the Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL and Asus ZenFone 3

Deluxe, all of which come with the new Snapdragon processor. The new processor,

the Snapdragon 821, is said to be roughly twice as efficient and capable than

the Snapdragon 810.



The new chipset could also bring to the picture support for virtual reality and

Google Daydream, if it comes stocked with Android Nougat. The current list of

devices that support Google Daydream include the Google Pixel and Pixel XL only,

so if the OnePlus 3T supports it, it could be the biggest selling point.

OnePlus CEO Carl Pei has teased that the upcoming device will feature the

beloved AMOLED display, and also keep the headphone jack that was omitted from

the likes of the iPhone 7 and Moto Z. OnePlus is known for being affordable, so

if it can pack in all of these features and still keep the price low, other

phone companies might have something to be worried about.
