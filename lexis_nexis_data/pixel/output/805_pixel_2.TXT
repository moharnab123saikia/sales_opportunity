Going ga-ga over Google Earth: CYBER TRAVEL: You can explore a destination

before you get there

Fasten your seatbelts for a wild ride. Zoom from the White House to the former

Republic Palace in Baghdad. Land in Moscow's Red Square then fly over to

Pyongyang, North Korea. And remarkably, you don't have to leave home to do so.



You can just sit at your computer and access an amazing new service called

Google Earth, software that puts satellite images of almost every inch of the

planet within reach of your mouse -- for free. It is no exaggeration to say it

is the ultimate armchair travel experience.



You can zoom in from space to street level to explore cities, landmarks,

buildings, road networks, mountains, lakes, valleys. You can key in the address

of the hotel you'll be staying at on your vacation and check out how long it

will take you to walk to the nearest Starbucks.



Yes, I'm gushing, because Google Earth represents a paradigm shift on the

Internet. And I'm not alone in my praise.



"This reminds me of the first days of e-mail. The idea you could send a message

to France in an instant was so exciting," says Internet consultant and author

Rick Broadhead. "Normally, technology like satellite imagery was only available

to large media organizations or institutions. Now, Google has made it available

to pretty much anyone, for free.



"Is it a huge leap forward? Absolutely.



"People are stunned when they see this. It's so powerful, they almost don't know

what to do with the information."



The benefits for travellers are clear -- or at least as clear as the resolution

of images on Google Earth.



What I'm saying is that some locations are clearer than others, because

different areas are covered at different resolutions. (In technology terms, the

resolution varies from one kilometre per pixel to six inches per pixel. At the

lowest resolution, features such as mountains and lakes are visible. At the

highest, you can see cars on the street, even people in Tiananmen Square.)



The images are not live. Indeed, some are a year or two old. That's how Google

explains away the scarier aspects of this technology. Some nations, such as

India, Thailand and South Korea, have complained that Google Earth exposes

politically sensitive areas, leaving them vulnerable to terrorist attacks.



"It is important to know that Google Earth is built from information that is

already available from a wide range of both commercial and public sources," says

Eileen Rodriguez, spokeswoman for California-based Google.



"The same information is available to anyone who flies above or drives by a

piece of property."



There are all sorts of other bells and whistles on the downloadable program (go

to http://earth.



google.com), which at the moment is available only to Windows users and only in

English.



Three-dimensional mapping of 38 U.S. cities allows you to "walk" around actual

buildings. And sophisticated video technology allows for "fluid, free-form"

exploration. Users can zoom in, tilt and rotate around whatever they see.



"You can literally explore a destination before you get there," says Broadhead.



That may take away some of the surprise factor for travellers, but sometimes

that's a good thing.
