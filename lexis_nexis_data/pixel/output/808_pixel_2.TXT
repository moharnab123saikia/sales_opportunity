Now you don't need the latest, greatest Web-enabled wireless phone or handheld

device to tap the power of the Internet when you're on the road.



Google's new Short Message Service enables you to get answers from any wireless

phone or device capable of sending a simple text message.



With Google SMS, you can get phone numbers, dictionary definitions, product

prices and much more. You can do math problems, measurement conversions and even

look up basic facts.



Google SMS returns the answers to your queries in plain text, usually within a

minute. It's really pretty handy. The service works with most major wireless

carriers, including AT&T, Cingular, Nextel, Sprint PCS, T-Mobile and Verizon.



For a complete rundown on the service and how to use it, visit www.google

D-I-Y Icons



If you're the type who likes to personalize every facet of your desktop,

consider do-it-yourself icons. It's fairly quick and easy to do with Windows XP.



Here's how: Click Start, Click Run, type "mspaint" (without the quotes) and

click OK to open the Paint application.



On Paint's Image menu, click Attributes. Enter 32 into both the Width and Height

boxes, click the Pixels radio button and then click OK to create a new,

icon-sized canvas.



From there, add color, type or whatever you like. You can even shrink photos to

32 by 32 pixels and paste them into the Paint document.



When you're done, click the File Menu and Save As, then give the icon a name and

use "ico" for the extension, ala "filename.ico".



Make note of where you've saved the file. To use your new icon, right-click on

any shortcut or folder, select Properties, click the Shortcut tab, click the

Change Icon button and browse to your newly created icon.



AOL Finally Gets It



For years, America Online customers had no choice but to use AOL's clunky e-mail

program.



That finally changed when AOL made its e-mail technology compatible with many

popular third-party e-mail applications applications.



If you're an AOL customer, you now have alternatives for sending and receiving

AOL e-mail, including Eudora, Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express, and other

e-mail clients that support Internet Message Access Protocol.



The downside is some features of AOL e-mail won't be available if you choose an

alternate e-mail program. For example, you won't be able to check the status of

a sent message or recall an unopened message sent to another AOL member.



For step-by-step instructions on configuring Outlook Express and other e-mail

applications for use with AOL e-mail, visit tinyurl.com/3goak.
