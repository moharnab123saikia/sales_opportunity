Google Pixel C Price: (EURO)509 from www.store.google.com (free delivery)

Rating: ???? HHHH Ever since Apple introduced the iPad, it has dominated tablet

sales. It's not just because of the bigger, deeper app store, either. The iPad

has always been better designed, sleeker and more durable than almost any of its

Android counterparts.



The only way to compete in the long term, it seems, is to really invest heavily

in the hardware. This is what is giving Microsoft traction with its Surface Pro

hybrid range. And it is very clearly in evidence with Google's new 10-inch Pixel

C tablet. The Pixel C is staking a major claim to being the best Android tablet

you can get, largely because of its solid aluminium build, fantastic screen and

lightning fast graphics.



It also has a dedicated keyboard built specially for it (but sold separately)

that turns this into a very competent laptop replacement for light, on-the-go

tasks.



It's a little heavier than the iPad Air 2, its closest rival, but is

considerably lighter than Microsoft's Surface 3, if one wants to bring Windows

into the comparison. (I've gone off the Surface 3: it's underpowered and its

keyboard will frustrate the bejesus out of you.) For anyone who cares, there's

also an 8-megapixel HD camera on the rear of the machine.



Is it worth the price of a top-end iPad? For anyone who lives off Google apps

(Docs, Drive and Gmail), it's certainly a valid contender.



One tip: if you're considering this machine, you should really get the keyboard

designed to go with it. It's a superior Bluetooth model with wide, spacious keys

and a clever magnetic mechanism that lets you angle the tablet-screen at almost

any pitch. It also supports inductive charging.
