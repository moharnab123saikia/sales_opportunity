Rating: ???? HHHH Ever since Apple introduced the iPad, it has dominated tablet
sales. It's not just because of the bigger, deeper app store, either. The iPad
has always been better designed, sleeker and more durable than almost any of its
Android counterparts.

The only way to compete in the long term, it seems, is to really invest heavily
in the hardware. This is what is giving Microsoft traction with its Surface Pro
hybrid range. And it is very clearly in evidence with Google's new 10-inch Pixel
C tablet. The Pixel C is staking a major claim to being the best Android tablet
you can get, largely because of its solid aluminium build, fantastic screen and
lightning fast graphics.

It also has a dedicated keyboard built specially for it (but sold separately)
that turns this into a very competent laptop replacement for light, on-the-go
tasks.

It's a little heavier than the iPad Air 2, its closest rival, but is
considerably lighter than Microsoft's Surface 3, if one wants to bring Windows
into the comparison. (I've gone off the Surface 3: it's underpowered and its
keyboard will frustrate the bejesus out of you.) For anyone who cares, there's
also an 8-megapixel HD camera on the rear of the machine.

Is it worth the price of a top-end iPad? For anyone who lives off Google apps
(Docs, Drive and Gmail), it's certainly a valid contender.

One tip: if you're considering this machine, you should really get the keyboard
designed to go with it. It's a superior Bluetooth model with wide, spacious keys
and a clever magnetic mechanism that lets you angle the tablet-screen at almost
any pitch. It also supports inductive charging.
