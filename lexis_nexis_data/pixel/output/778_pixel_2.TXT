LENGTH: 225  words





Benchmark tests revealed that the Nexus 5 bested most other Android rivals.



Friday, September 27, 2013: The Nexus 4 smartphone from Google may have been a

pretty affordable device, but the Nexus 5 is going to be an absolute beast of a

device. According to benchmark test results from GFXBench, reported by Phone

Arena, the next generation of the Nexus is going to be right up there with

high-end smartphones in the market. Google and LG seem to be putting out the

best specs as the new Nexus is beating most of the other rivals in performance

and graphics.



In fact, Google's Nexus 5, which is being developed by LG, came out to be at par

with Apple's new iPhone 5S. In a recent report, the iPhone 5S had beaten all its

Android rivals in performance tests. The only area where the Nexus 5 may be

behind the iPhone 5S is the display and that is because it has a considerably

larger 12.7-cm (5-inch) display as compared to the Apple iPhone 5S.



Internet rumours suggest that the Nexus 5 device will be launched in October. It

is said that the device will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor

along with 3 GB of RAM. The 12.7-cm (5-inch) screen on the device will offer

1080 pixel resolutions. The device will also be capable of 70band LTE radio and

will have a 13 mega pixel rear camera. It will run on the Android 4.4 KitKat

operating system.
