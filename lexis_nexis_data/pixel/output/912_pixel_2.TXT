Despite Steve Jobs' avowed rejection of a 7-inch form factor, the post-Jobs
Apple went ahead with a downsized 7.9-inch display for the iPad mini.

With a screen resolution of 1,024 x 768 pixels, this baby is favoured by those
seeking a lighter tablet that can be held in one hand.

Once again, the lure of a well-populated app store is the main appeal.

Google Nexus 7

The Google Nexus 7 is a favourite with Android users for one reason - it is the
first to receive the latest updates to Google's mobile operating system. The
buttery smooth performance of Android 4.2 Jelly Bean is well complemented by its
hardware, which includes an Nvidia Tegra 3 quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM to
keep apps running smoothly on this compact tablet.

Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7

Measuring 7.89mm and weighing 340g, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 is a portable
tablet that is easy to handle. It stands out with its Super Amoled Plus display,
delivering rich colours and clear images on its 7.7-inch screen. With its 1.4GHz
dual-core processor, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 creates a smooth seamless user
experience.

Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 LTE

The Galaxy Tab 8.9 LTE represents the sweet spot for those who want a large
screen but not the weight of a bulky tablet. Viewing movies is as easy and as
comfortable as reading e-books on this 8.9-inch display with its screen
resolution of 1,280 x 800 pixels.

Sony Tablet P

The Sony Tablet P is one of the most interesting Android tablets to date, with
two 5.5-inch displays to house the customised Android user interface. This
innovative design allows users to use the bottom screen as a keyboard or
touchpad controller while the top screen acts as a regular display.
