

GOOGLE will today launch its Pixel smartphone which will be at the hub of new
virtual reality and smart home devices.

The handset will slip into a headset and transport users into a new world, which
might be the flight deck of a spaceship or the audience for a Rihanna concert.

Google is due to unveil the Pixel, right, at an event in the US. It is thought
there will be a 5in Pixel and a 5.5in Pixel XL.
