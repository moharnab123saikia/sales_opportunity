Immerse yourself beyond reality;

Virtual reality is taking over the world of gaming. With the arrival of the new

Oculus Rift and Sony's PlayStation VR, Wez Evans looks at what's available

Oculus Rift was once synonymous with virtual reality in the same way the iPod

was with the MP3 player. Now the market has expanded to include a wide range of

platforms that vary in quality, cost and a few other parameters. VR may not be

an essential purchase just yet, but the time has never been better for those

looking to dip their toe into what is arguably the future of home entertainment.



Google Cardboard is very much the entry-level VR experience at about (EURO)20.

Users can either purchase the Cardboard with a pre-manufactured frame or

construct their own using basic, low-cost parts such as velcro, Sellotape and

cardboard, fitting them to the lenses provided.



In order to function, the Cardboard requires a smartphone running at least

Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) or iOS, which is inserted at the front. The headset's

lenses then convert the phone's screen into an enveloping virtual reality,

although at this price point it's unsurprisingly one of the least convincing VR

headsets available.



The Cardboard's bigger brother, on the other hand, is a much more powerful

device. Google's Daydream View also requires the help of an Android smartphone,

namely its own recently released Pixel, though the company promises that more

"Daydream-ready" phones are on the way.



The Pixel, as well as its operating system, Nougat, is being developed with VR

in mind, and the Daydream will be able to take full advantage of the phone's

head-tracking algorithms and sensors.



HTC, Samsung, Asus, LG, Xiaomi, Alcatel, and ZTA have all announced Daydream

compatible phones but it takes more than hardware to create a successful

platform. Google has partnered with HBO, Netflix, Hulu, Lionsgate, NBA, MLB and

the Wall Street Journal to develop an impressive catalogue of apps as well as

flexing its YouTube muscles to bring in content creators like lifecaster Justine

Ezarik (also known as iJustine) and the Dolan twins (of AwesomenessTV) who will

create unique 360-degree promotional material.



Daydream View is an aesthetic departure from its rivals, sporting a cloth-based

frame as opposed to the industry standard's solid plastic. This makes it both

comfortable to wear and hand-washable - a reasonable selling point as prolonged

use of any headset can leave the user with a reasonably sweaty brow. The

material comes in three colour variations: Slate at launch with Crimson and Snow

available later down the line.



Similar to Cardboard and Daydream, the Samsung Gear VR works in partnership with

an Android phone. Provided you already own a Galaxy Note5, Galaxy S6, S7, or any

of their Edge and Plus variations the Gear VR is an incredibly cheap and

powerful alternative at around (EURO)60.



While the recent mass recall of faulty Galaxy S7 Edges doesn't necessarily

reflect poorly on the Gear VR, it does serve as a reminder that a faulty phone

means a faulty VR device. Buyer, beware.



Originally demoed back in 2014, the HTV Vive got a full release in April of this

year to almost universally positive reviews. As one of the most powerful virtual

reality headsets available right now the cost of more than (EURO)900 is steep,

yet that doesn't factor in the potentially steeper cost of upgrading or even

buying a PC capable of running software for the device.



The Vive is a graphically demanding headset, requiring roughly triple the power

of a typical gaming PC. Gaming rigs rocking anything less than Nvidea's Geforce

GTX 970 will likely need beefing up in order to run most of what the HTC has to

offer. Gameplay is projected onto two screens simultaneously (one for each eye)

at 1200 x 1080 resolution, making even low-intensity indie games a reasonably

big task to render.



The result of all this processing power is a thoroughly immersive gameplay

experience, further intensified by the Vive's unique controllers. The wireless

motion tracked controllers feature a comfortable trigger as well as

squeezeactivated buttons, which translate perfectly when the user attempts pick

up an object or otherwise interact with a digital world.



This digital world demands adequate space, however. While HTC recommends 2

metres x 1.5 metres some games issue a warning on startup if the user attempts

to play in anything less than 3m x 3m. A front-facing camera can be toggled to

provide picture-in-picture view of the surrounding area, allowing you to

maintain a safe distance from obstacles.



Further limiting your area of play is the sheer volume of cabling required to

hook the Vive up. While not a deal breaker, a wired VR connection might not be

for everyone, especially considering the headset weighs in at 555g before

everything's even plugged in.



The Oculus Rift is easily the Vive's biggest competitor with a similar level of

graphical fidelity and (EURO)200 knocked off the cost. The hardware requirements

are only slightly lower - you'll still want a pretty beastly PC to make the Rift

do its thing - and physical space is a non-issue with most software allowing you

to remain seated, negating any issues with cabling.



This crowdfunded machine's biggest drawback is lack of motion controls. The long

awaited Touch controllers are still in development, so for now players will need

to settle for the Xbox One game pad - a perfectly viable method of interaction

that unfortunately can't compare to the Vive's slick and visceral triggers.



In October, Oculus acquired the Irish micro-LED developer InfiniLED, a

Cork-based company specialising in the development of wearable displays and TV

screens. According to www.Uploadvr.com, InfiniLED has moved into Oculus

Research's new Cork offices in order to further develop inorganic LEDS, which

will reduce the Rift's power consumption without compromising visual quality.



The purchase of InfiniLED indicates that we'll either see a new, cheaper

generation of Rifts down the line, or at least a price drop for the original

Oculus as a more efficient version hits the market.



At (EURO)400, PlayStation VR seems to hit the sweet spot of affordability

without overly compromising quality. Similar to the Rift and Vive, external

hardware is essential, though here in the form of a PlayStation 4. The

difference is that in this case all hardware is created equal. Whether you

bought a PS4 at launch, just as PSVR released, or plan on waiting for the

upcoming PS4 Pro, Sony's headset will work just as efficiently regardless.



That said, in order to let the PSVR headset talk to your console you'll need to

drop a little extra cash on the PS4 camera, which clocks in at (EURO)60.



Optionally the PS Move motion controllers also run to (EURO)35, although the

standard PS4 controller works just fine.



Much like the Oculus Rift, some games are a little jarring without motion

controls but for titles such as EVE: Valkyrie (which is available on both

platforms) a game pad is actually preferable.



Virtual reality has crested through its content drought with plenty of games and

interactive experiences on the horizon that make any of these headsets a

worthwhile purchase. The one thing holding it back is potential motion sickness

as some but not all users complain of nausea after prolonged use, and in some

cases any use at all.



As unhelpful a clich√© as it's become virtual reality needs to be experienced to

be truly understood. The most important aspect to take away is that the

technology works. Just how well it works will depend on how much money you're

willing to part with in return for a tour of a virtual world.
