According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Aspects of the disclosure relate to generating a digital terrain model ("DTM")

from a digital surface model ("DSM"). For example, the DSM may include a

plurality pixels associated with coordinate information and elevation

information, including the elevation of features such as buildings and large

vegetation. Initially, a set of vertices defining a polygon may be identified. A

set of seed pixels, corresponding to points of the DSM of "bare" earth (without

buildings or large vegetation) may also be identified. These may be the same or

different from the set of vertices. An adaptive flood filler algorithm is used

to evaluate the pixels of the polygon starting with the seed pixels. This

process validates or invalidates the state of the pixels. The result is an

approximation of a DTM for the polygon."
