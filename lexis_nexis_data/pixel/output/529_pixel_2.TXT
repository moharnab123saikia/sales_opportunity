According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Aspects of the disclosure relate to generating a digital terrain model ("DTM")
from a digital surface model ("DSM"). For example, the DSM may include a
plurality pixels associated with coordinate information and elevation
information, including the elevation of features such as buildings and large
vegetation. Initially, a set of vertices defining a polygon may be identified. A
set of seed pixels, corresponding to points of the DSM of "bare" earth (without
buildings or large vegetation) may also be identified. These may be the same or
different from the set of vertices. An adaptive flood filler algorithm is used
to evaluate the pixels of the polygon starting with the seed pixels. This
process validates or invalidates the state of the pixels. The result is an
approximation of a DTM for the polygon."
