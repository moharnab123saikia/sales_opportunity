THE Pixel is not the first phone to have Google's brand - but with Samsung

recovering from the Note7 disaster - the Pixel could become the most successful.

The Pixel has been designed from the ground up by Google engineers to give their

ideal Android phone.



The Pixel has the impressive Google Assistant built in. It is similar to Apple's

Siri or Microsoft's Cortana but able to better understand context, follow up

questions and can be introduced to conversations. Just tagging@google when

discussing where to go for dinner nearby and you'll have an answer. Google also

promises the assistant will learn as you use it. Like the Galaxy and iPhone it

will compete with, the Pixel will come in a standard or "XL" size. Price from

$1079.
