Priced at  11, 350, the much-hyped smartphone is expected to be available in

Gold and White-Silver variants



Tuesday, July 28, 2015: Indian handset maker Lava has joined hands with Google

in order to launch the Pixel Series; a new smartphone series running on Android.

The flagship variant under this series, Pixel V1 claims to be the first

second-generation device from Google's Android One smartphones. Priced at  11,

350, the much-hyped smartphone is expected to be available in Gold and

White-Silver variants.



While the specifications of the handset were listed online hours ahead of its

launch, we bring you more features which were previously kept under the wraps.



Similar to what had been leaked earlier, the much-awaited handset sports a

12.7cm (5.5- inch) display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. Powered by a

1.3GHz quad-core MediaTek processor coupled with 2GB DDR3 RAM, the phone claims

to have 32GB ROM which can be further expanded up to 32GB more via microSD card.



Backed by a 2560mAh battery, the device comes with dual-SIM slot and Asahi

Dragon Trail glass promising high scratch and damage-resistance.



The phone runs on Android 5.1.1. It has a 13MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture,

BSI sensor, blue glass filter along with an 8MP front-facing camera with f/2.4

lens to capture exceptionally beautiful selfies. Its connectivity options

include Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, USB OTG and micro-USB.



As Lava was a partner for Android One initiative by Google, the handset is

likely to get two years' worth of Android updates straight from Google, which is

expected to begin with Android M.



While the first Android One smartphone by the firm will be sold exclusively

through Flipkart starting today, the device will be available in various retail

stores across the country.
