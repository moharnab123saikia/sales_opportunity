forever to bring its own-brand hardware stylings to the smartphone, but it s
logical the search giant would eventually offer something to showcase the best
of Android, in the same way Apple has the iPhone to carry iOS. There s every
reason to believe the Pixel could be a genuine iPhone killer, in a market that
appears to be growing tired of the incumbents.

A battery that charges seven hours in just 15 minutes might not seem as cool as
an intelligent voice-activated assistant, but this combination of core
functionality and bleeding-edge features is highly likely to win people over.
Never underestimate the importance of battery life.

Google s biggest challenge will be differentiating in an incredibly competitive
space, where Android fans could easily default to Samsung.

Mr Doku added that the inclusion of artificial intelligence and virtual reality
content could help the Pixel stand out.

With a potentially market-leading camera, sleek design and a Google ecosystem
stacked with the latest in AI and VR, this might just be the handset to inject a
dose of cool back into the smartphone market,  he said.
