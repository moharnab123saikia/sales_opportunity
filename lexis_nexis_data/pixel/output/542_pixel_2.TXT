Google's Pixel smartphone takes on Apple

Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at comparison site uSwitch, said:  It s taken Google

forever to bring its own-brand hardware stylings to the smartphone, but it s

logical the search giant would eventually offer something to showcase the best

of Android, in the same way Apple has the iPhone to carry iOS. There s every

reason to believe the Pixel could be a genuine iPhone killer, in a market that

appears to be growing tired of the incumbents.



A battery that charges seven hours in just 15 minutes might not seem as cool as

an intelligent voice-activated assistant, but this combination of core

functionality and bleeding-edge features is highly likely to win people over.

Never underestimate the importance of battery life.



Google s biggest challenge will be differentiating in an incredibly competitive

space, where Android fans could easily default to Samsung.



Mr Doku added that the inclusion of artificial intelligence and virtual reality

content could help the Pixel stand out.



With a potentially market-leading camera, sleek design and a Google ecosystem

stacked with the latest in AI and VR, this might just be the handset to inject a

dose of cool back into the smartphone market,  he said.
