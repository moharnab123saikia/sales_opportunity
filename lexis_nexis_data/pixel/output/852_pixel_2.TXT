Ebook readers may have slow monochrome screens and limited functions but they
will get you online, to download books and journals, at a bargain price

Amazon 'Original' Kindle, £69 6in E Ink display, no touchscreen, wi-fi only.
Will hold up to 1,400 books. Battery life is exceptional and it's unrivalled for
its choice of books. amazon.co.uk

Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch, £79 7in E Ink display, touchscreen, wi-fi
only. Will hold about 1,000 books. It will be launched this week in Britain.

MID-RANGE Smaller than a full-sized tablet but more versatile than a simple
ebook reader, 7in tablets are a great compromise option. The iPad Mini is up
against these two entrenched rivals

Asus/Google Nexus 7, from £159 7in, 1280 x 800-pixel display, running Android,
with 8GB or 16GB of memory. Wi-fi only. Zippy, with a higher-resolution screen
than the iPad Mini. play.google.com/store

Amazon Kindle Fire HD, from £159 7in, 1280 x 800-pixel display, running Android,
with 16GB or 32GB of memory. It's not as fast as the Nexus 7 but does link
directly to Amazon's expansive online shops. amazon.co.uk

BLOW THE BUDGET

At the top end of the market, the iPad is challenged by Android and Windows
tablets. The latter are fast and attractive and run the new Windows 8, cleverly
adapted for touchscreens

Asus Padfone 2, from £600 (estimated)

10.1in, 1280 x 800-pixel display. Wi-fi and 3G. Asus's Transformer Pad is the
best of the pricier Android tablets, made up of a screen and keyboard. The
Padfone 2, coming soon, combines a Pad with a smartphone that slots into the
device. asus.co.uk

Microsoft Surface, from £399

10.6in, 1366 x 768-pixel display. Released last week, it's wi-fi only at
present. Memory goes from 32GB to 64GB. Windows 8 runs smoothly on this
well-made tablet; an extra £100 gets you a smart cover cum keyboard.
