MID-RANGE Smaller than a full-sized tablet but more versatile than a simple

ebook reader, 7in tablets are a great compromise option. The iPad Mini is up

against these two entrenched rivals



Asus/Google Nexus 7, from £159 7in, 1280 x 800-pixel display, running Android,

with 8GB or 16GB of memory. Wi-fi only. Zippy, with a higher-resolution screen

than the iPad Mini. play.google.com/store



Amazon Kindle Fire HD, from £159 7in, 1280 x 800-pixel display, running Android,

with 16GB or 32GB of memory. It's not as fast as the Nexus 7 but does link

directly to Amazon's expansive online shops. amazon.co.uk



BLOW THE BUDGET



At the top end of the market, the iPad is challenged by Android and Windows

tablets. The latter are fast and attractive and run the new Windows 8, cleverly

adapted for touchscreens



Asus Padfone 2, from £600 (estimated)



10.1in, 1280 x 800-pixel display. Wi-fi and 3G. Asus's Transformer Pad is the

best of the pricier Android tablets, made up of a screen and keyboard. The

Padfone 2, coming soon, combines a Pad with a smartphone that slots into the

device. asus.co.uk



Microsoft Surface, from £399



10.6in, 1366 x 768-pixel display. Released last week, it's wi-fi only at

present. Memory goes from 32GB to 64GB. Windows 8 runs smoothly on this

well-made tablet; an extra £100 gets you a smart cover cum keyboard.
