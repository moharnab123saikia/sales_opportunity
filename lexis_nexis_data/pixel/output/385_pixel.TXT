Google is beginning to TAKE on Look, feel of apple;

Internet giant's latest product strategy takes a page out of iPhone maker's

playbook

If Google's product bonanza Tuesday seemed familiar -- a new line of pricey

smartphones, a snazzy voice-activated service and a virtual-reality headset --

it wasn't by accident.



The hardware-software double play was decidedly Apple-like. It's no coincidence

because, frankly, Google is beginning to look, and feel, a lot more like Apple.

And that could mean a major shake-up in a tech industry roiled by questions over

Apple's innovation and declining iPhone sales,  Samsung's troubled Galaxy Note 7

smartphones, an expected sale of Twitter and a mad scramble by nearly everyone

else to bolster their cloud-computing services.



"The market has co-opted the Apple playbook in some ways," says Matthew Quint,

director of the Center on Global Brand Leadership at Columbia Business School.

From a design perspective, he said, Google's new Pixel phone "is as close as

possible in look to an iPhone than anyone, including Samsung." (Google has

aligned with Samsung in the latter's patent design dispute with Apple that goes

before the U.S. Supreme Court next week.)



There is a sea change at the Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif., with a product

strategy and approach straight out of the playbook at Infinite Loop in

Cupertino, Calif. In short, Google is constructing a digital empire of devices

and services, run from one platform, to compete with Apple's cohesive, polished

ecosystem. It is developing a system to control sleek consumer-electronic

products, software and services. The days of its fragmented Android approach are

over.



The Pixel line is "a recognition that the best hardware products come from the

companies that make the operating systems, which has been Apple's strategy all

along -- and Microsoft's more recently with the Surface and phones," says Jan

Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research.



The strategic gambit is exemplified in Pixel and Pixel XL, Google's new

smartphone product line. Priced at an iPhone-like $649 ($769 for the XL), the

sleek phones represent an improvement over their predecessor, Nexus. HTC is

assembling the new Google phones.



The phones featured high-end specs. But the real bragging rights came from the

Google Assistant, Google's version of Siri that, as Google would point out,

leverages the artificial intelligence and machine learning it has been

developing for years -- through its PC-based search, then through its extensive

mapping, and finally in efforts such as AlphaGo, the program that beat a human

champion at a notoriously difficult board game.



It was hard not to see the litany of examples of what Assistant could do in the

light of Apple's improved, but still-limited, Siri digital assistant.



The new phones also touted nifty features: cameras that snap photos faster,

longer battery life and free, unlimited storage, the kind of shopping list Apple

likes to trot out at its product launches. A video promoting the Pixel also

embraced something now missing on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus: "3.5-mm headphone

jack satisfyingly not new." In the background, someone coughs "ahem."



Google had more fun at the expense of Apple, poking fun at its South Bay

neighbor by announcing Pixel comes in three colors -- quite black, very silver

and really blue. Several weeks earlier, Apple unfurled the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7

Plus in black and jet black.



Google rounded out its bag of goodies with Google Assistant, a super-smart

digital helper; a new Home Internet-connected speaker device; a WiFi system; and

Daydream View, a VR headset.



It's the sort of hardware-software treasure trove Steve Jobs once imagined, and

spoke of.



Google's gambit isn't unique, nor is it flawless. Its retail strategy has

struggled in getting gadgets to consumers, and it does not have stores, as Apple

does, to display its wares. But it does have  momentum at a time when its

smartphone rivals face obstacles.



As Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin points out, Google and Microsoft --

with its Surface table strategy combining hardware and software -- are emulating

Apple. "It is a recognition that tightly integrating hardware and software will

always yield the best customer experience," he says.
