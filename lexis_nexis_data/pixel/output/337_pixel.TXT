

Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will be sold online and through a number
of multi-brand retail stores from Tuesday, as the search giant takes the plunge
into the most competitive phone market in the world.

Attacking the premium end of the market, the Pixel smartphone range will begin
from '57,000, but to attract consumers, the company will offer cash-backs and
equal monthly installment (EMI) plans from multiple banks from Tuesday. It will
go head-to-head with Apple's iPhone 7, which went on sale earlier this month,
besides Samsung's S7 and S7 Edge, which the South Korean major is pushing after
the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. The first 'Made By Google' smartphone will be
available on Flipkart and across organised and multi-brand retail stores
including Bajaj Electronics, Croma, Ezone, Jumbo, Poorvika, Reliance Digital,
Sangeetha and Vijay Sales, the company said in a statement on Monday. Google
entered the mobile space with its Nexus series where it partnered with other
manufacturers for design and input.But the company did not market the devices
and did not attach its own branding. Pixel, however, is fully conceptualised and
produced by Google, and the company is going all out to promote the device,
including a 360 degree marketing and branding campaign, a strategy it had not
adopted before.
