Computer specialist Tobias Weyand and his colleagues at Google have come up with

a deep-learning platform codenamed PlaNet. They have trained the system to

figure out locations where pictures have been captured on the basis of visual

cues. The project is interesting and it has showcased amazingly high degree of

accuracy in detecting places where images were taken. The system is improving

with time, said Google research team member Weyand.



The specialists at Google began by dividing up the globe into a grid, leaving

aside the oceans and polar region. MIT Technology Review reported that

thereafter, they formed a database for PlaNet, containing 126 million

geo-located pictures taken from the Internet.



PlaNet is an artificial neural network, thus it can learn. So the experts taught

the network how to recognize a picture's location on the grid only with the help

of information present in the pixels.



For testing the accuracy of PlaNet, Weyand and his team fed it 2.3 million

geo-tagged Flickr pictures. Then, PlaNet lessened 48% of them to the right

continent, 28.4% to the right country, 10.1% to the right city, and 3.6% to the

real street.



With further improvement, PlaNet can exactly locate every single random picture

on a map, however, it has to consider many other factors and pixels in pictures.

In some cases, the system makes wrong guess about location.



Though the findings might not seem all that great initially, they became

extraordinary when the tech giant team pitted their machine opposed to 10 smart,

well-traveled humans. The machine managed to win over 50% of the rounds and had

better accuracy.



The team wrote in their abstract regarding the system, "PlaNet outperforms

previous approaches and even attains superhuman levels of accuracy in some

cases".



According to the team, PlaNet doesn't need a lot of memory, either. MIT

Technology Review reported that the model uses just 377 MB, which means it could

be easily loaded on a smartphone.



PlaNet has distinct abilities, and it could end up being like a Shazam for

picture locations. A user can run, Carmen Sandiego, but can't stay out of sight

of the Google machine.
