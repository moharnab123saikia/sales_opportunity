Asus Transformer Pad TF300



When it comes to hardware specs, the Asus Transformer Pad TF300 is a real

powerhouse. An 8-megapixel camera, quad-core Nvidia Tegra 3 processor and a

10.1-inch display with a screen resolution of 1,280 x 800 pixels are packed into

this Android tablet. Its keyboard docking station adds more functionality,

including a USB port and an SD card slot, neither of which is common in Android

tablets.



Google Nexus 7



Google's Android Jelly Bean tablet is a versatile device. Its 7-inch display and

screen resolution of 1,280 x 800 pixels make it suitable as a movie viewer,

e-book reader and Web browser. Enhanced search features, such as Google Now,

which can show you the fastest route home or when your next appointment is, set

it apart from other Android tablets.



Motorola Xoom 2



About 10 per cent lighter and 33per cent thinner than its predecessor, the Xoom

2 is a much sleeker and a more appealing Android tablet to behold. It was

introduced with features such as a splash-guard coating to protect it from water

spills and a faster 1.2GHz dual-core processor. Motorola chose to keep the

Android user interface relatively untouched, thus pleasing the Android-loving

crowd.



Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1



Among Android tablets, the Galaxy Note 10.1 creates the most innovative

interactive experience with its S Pen stylus. With a click of a button on the

pen, you can outline and crop a screenshot and send it to your friends by

e-mail.



The S Pen shares the same Air View feature as Samsung's Galaxy Note II LTE,

allowing you to preview images and e-mail messages when the S Pen is hovering

over them.



Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1



Simple and unassuming, it has rounded edges like its predecessor. Where the

Tab210.1 shows the greatest improvement is in its battery life. It lasts twice

as long as the original Tab 10.1.



This Samsung tablet, with its dual-core 1.2GHz processor, delivers a smooth

performance.
