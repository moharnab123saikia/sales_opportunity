Assignee:  Google Inc. (Mountain View, CA)

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
computer-implemented method includes identifying a bit-mapped image of a line or
polygon shape; mapping the image to a texture map that is slightly large in at
least one dimension than the bit-mapped image; overlaying the bit-mapped image
and the texture map; computing pixel shading for pixels between an outer edge of
the bit-mapped image and the texture map by measuring a distance from particular
ones of the pixels to an idealized line near an edge of the bit-mapped image;
and displaying the bit-mapped image with pixels at its edge shaded according to
the computed pixel shading."

The patent was filed on January 5, 2012 Application no. 13/344,605
