According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
system and method for generating a road network based on satellite imagery.
Plural pixels corresponding to satellite imagery of a region are obtained. For
each of the plural pixels, a probability value corresponding to the probability
that the pixel belongs within the road network is calculated. A grayscale image
is formed based on the calculated probability values. Plural curves are produced
based on the grayscale image, wherein the producing of each curve includes
positioning a shape on the grayscale image so that an average intensity of the
grayscale image covered by the shape exceeds a preset threshold, moving the
shape about the grayscale image while the average intensity is maintained, and
tracking the movement of the shape to produce the curve. A planar-connected
graph is generated by connecting at least portions of the plural curves. The
planar-connected graph corresponds to the road network."

The patent was filed on April 13, 2012 Application no. 13/446,948
