If you like plus size phones, Google has you covered with its Pixel XL
smartphone. Just like its younger sibling, the Pixel XL features metal and glass
construction. The phone boasts of Pixel Imprint, which is Google's way of saying
fingerprint sensor. Thanks to its bigger footprint, the Pixel XL packs-in a
bigger 3450 mAh battery compared to that of the Pixel.

The handset sports a 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED screen. Now that's quite a pixel
packed screen when compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. The Pixel XL is powered by the
Snapdragon 821 chipset with 4 GB RAM. In the photography department, you get a
12-megapixel main camera with EIS (Electronic Image Stabilisation). For selfies,
there's an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. The phone supports 4G VoLTE, which
means that it is compatible with Reliance Jio network. Other connectivity
essentials include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, and A-GPS. On the software front, the
phone will ship with Android 7.1 Nougat.

The Google Pixel XL will come in Quite Black, Very Silver, and Really Blue. The
32 GV version is pegged at $769 (approx Rs 51,000), while the 128 GB variant
will set you back for $869 (roughly Rs 58,000). The device is up for pre-order
