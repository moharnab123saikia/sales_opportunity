
DATELINE: San Francisco


San Francisco, Sept. 30 -- Google is countering the release of Apple's latest
iPhones with two devices running on a new version of Android software.
 The Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X unveiled Tuesday are the first smartphones sold with
the Marshmallow upgrade.


 The Marshmallow version of Android enables users to summon Google Now to scan
whatever content might be on a mobile device's screen so it can present
pertinent information about the topic of a text, a song, a video clip or an
article.
 The new Android feature, called 'Now on Tap', can be activated by holding down
the device's home button or speaking, "OK Google," into the microphone. It will
prompt 'Now on Tap' to scan the screen in an attempt to figure out how to be the
most helpful.
 "In a multiscreen world, it is even more important for Google to do the hard
work so the experience is simple and delightful for the users," Google CEO
Sundar Pichai said.
 Apple's new operating system also has programmed the iPhone's Siri assistant to
be more intuitive so it can anticipate what the user might want or need before
being explicitly asked.
 Google began taking pre-orders for the Nexus phones in the U.S., United
Kingdom, Ireland and Japan on Tuesday with prices for the 6P starting at $499
and $379 for the 5X with no commitment to a wireless contract required. They are
expected to start shipping by mid-October.
 The Nexus phones are undercutting Apple, which sells the iPhone 6s for $649 and
the 6S Plus for $749 without a subsidy from a wireless carrier.
 Google uses its Nexus line of phones to showcase how the company would like
Android to be set up. Most phone makers, though, still take advantage of the
freedom that Google gives them to alter Android, although the free software
usually is still set up to drive traffic to Google's search engine, YouTube
video site and other digital services.
 The Nexus phones also feature better cameras than previous models, matching
similar upgrades that Apple just made to its iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
 The Nexus 6P has a 5.7-inch screen, slightly larger than the iPhone 6s Plus.
The Nexus 5X has a 5.2-inch screen.
 But it won't be necessary to have a Nexus phone to get Marshmallow. People will
receive the option to install a free upgrade beginning next week.
 The debut of the latest Nexus phones underscores the steadily intensifying
rivalry between Google and Apple as they duel for consumers' loyalty in the
increasingly important mobile device market.
 Besides its Nexus phones, Google also began selling upgrades to its Chromecast
video-streaming device and a new Chromecast model that can be plugged into
speakers to play music from a phone or an Internet service. The devices will
sell for $35 apiece, the same price that Google has been charging for the
original Chromecast, which has won over a lot of households.
 Google disclosed on Tuesday that more than 20 million of the Chromecast video
devices have been sold since the gadget's debut two years ago.
 Google also provided a peek at a tablet called the Pixel C that is aimed at
consumers and workers who want a device that can accommodate a lot of typing.
The $499 tablet comes with a 10-inch display screen an attachable $149 keyboard
that transforms the device into the equivalent of a laptop, when needed. Apple
will begin selling a similar model of its pioneering iPad with a 13-inch screen
later this fall. Prices start at $799 for that iPad and $169 for the keyboard.
