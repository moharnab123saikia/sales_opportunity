The Google Nexus: tech, specs and pricing

San Francisco, Sept. 30 -- Google is countering the release of Apple's latest

iPhones with two devices running on a new version of Android software.

 The Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X unveiled Tuesday are the first smartphones sold with

the Marshmallow upgrade.





 The Marshmallow version of Android enables users to summon Google Now to scan

whatever content might be on a mobile device's screen so it can present

pertinent information about the topic of a text, a song, a video clip or an

article.

 The new Android feature, called 'Now on Tap', can be activated by holding down

the device's home button or speaking, "OK Google," into the microphone. It will

prompt 'Now on Tap' to scan the screen in an attempt to figure out how to be the

most helpful.

 "In a multiscreen world, it is even more important for Google to do the hard

work so the experience is simple and delightful for the users," Google CEO

Sundar Pichai said.

 Apple's new operating system also has programmed the iPhone's Siri assistant to

be more intuitive so it can anticipate what the user might want or need before

being explicitly asked.

 Google began taking pre-orders for the Nexus phones in the U.S., United

Kingdom, Ireland and Japan on Tuesday with prices for the 6P starting at $499

and $379 for the 5X with no commitment to a wireless contract required. They are

expected to start shipping by mid-October.

 The Nexus phones are undercutting Apple, which sells the iPhone 6s for $649 and

the 6S Plus for $749 without a subsidy from a wireless carrier.

 Google uses its Nexus line of phones to showcase how the company would like

Android to be set up. Most phone makers, though, still take advantage of the

freedom that Google gives them to alter Android, although the free software

usually is still set up to drive traffic to Google's search engine, YouTube

video site and other digital services.

 The Nexus phones also feature better cameras than previous models, matching

similar upgrades that Apple just made to its iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.

 The Nexus 6P has a 5.7-inch screen, slightly larger than the iPhone 6s Plus.

The Nexus 5X has a 5.2-inch screen.

 But it won't be necessary to have a Nexus phone to get Marshmallow. People will

receive the option to install a free upgrade beginning next week.

 The debut of the latest Nexus phones underscores the steadily intensifying

rivalry between Google and Apple as they duel for consumers' loyalty in the

increasingly important mobile device market.

 Besides its Nexus phones, Google also began selling upgrades to its Chromecast

video-streaming device and a new Chromecast model that can be plugged into

speakers to play music from a phone or an Internet service. The devices will

sell for $35 apiece, the same price that Google has been charging for the

original Chromecast, which has won over a lot of households.

 Google disclosed on Tuesday that more than 20 million of the Chromecast video

devices have been sold since the gadget's debut two years ago.

 Google also provided a peek at a tablet called the Pixel C that is aimed at

consumers and workers who want a device that can accommodate a lot of typing.

The $499 tablet comes with a 10-inch display screen an attachable $149 keyboard

that transforms the device into the equivalent of a laptop, when needed. Apple

will begin selling a similar model of its pioneering iPad with a 13-inch screen

later this fall. Prices start at $799 for that iPad and $169 for the keyboard.
