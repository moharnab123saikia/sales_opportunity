it will start getting sold from November 10

Google announced its Daydream VR platform at the company's I/O 2016 event,
followed by the actual headset named Daydream View. Carrying a price of $79, the
headset will officially be available to purchase starting from this month and it
will officially be available on November 10. In order to start viewing Daydream
content on your smartphone, you will need to own a smartphone that's not only
running impressive hardware specifications, but is also running Android 7.0 out
of the box.

So far, there are only a few smartphones available that can run Daydream VR,
with LG V20, and the Pixel lineup running Android 7.0 to name a few. Daydream
View is also lightweight, and weighs far less compared to other VR headsets
readily available in the market. It also features an attractive fabric that
upgrades its aesthetics, and the soft fabric present inside will provide a
comfortable experience to the wearer. In addition to the headset, there is also
a controller that has multiple sensors built into it, allowing you to take your
VR experience on smartphones to the very next level.

The controller has a 220mAh battery and has been designed to run for a very long
period (up to 12 hours). If you're looking for an affordable Daydream ready
smartphone, then be sure to check out the ZTE Axon 7 at Gear Best, which is an
affordable flagship and sports a Snapdragon 820 combined with 4GB of RAM, which
are essentially the minimum hardware requirements necessary for the smartphone
to be Daydream ready.
