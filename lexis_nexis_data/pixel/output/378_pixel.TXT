Google unveiled two new smartphones to go head-to-head with Apple and outlined

its plans for artificial intelligence.



At a San Francisco event, the company showed off its Pixel line of smartphones,

with Google's head of hardware Rick Osterloh announcing the 5in Pixel and the

5Â½in Pixel XL as expected.



Much of the detail had already leaked online in recent days. The Pixel will have

a choice between 32GB and 128GB of storage and come with 4GB of RAM. The phone

will run Qualcomm's latest 821 processor,and have fingerprint scanner.



The phones have 12.3 megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image

stabilisation and eight megapixel front cameras.



It comes with a rear glass panel and a polished aluminium case, and "no

unsightly camera bump", said Mr Osterloh.



"The technology needs to be smart and just work for you," he said. "That's why

we believe the next innovation is going to take place between hardware and

software, with AI at the centre."



Chief executive Sundar Pichai kicked off the event by outlining the company's

progress in machine learning and its plans for the technology.



"It is clear to me that we are morphing from a mobile-first to an AI-first

world," he said. "Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every

user."



Google has already used its Assistant technology in its Allo messaging app, and

Mr Pichai said it would be brought to "two new surfaces": phones and homes.

Pixel will be the first phone to have Assistant built in.



Mr Osterloh also emphasised the phone would never run out of space, with free

storage for video and photographs at original resolution, and Clay Bavor took to

the stage to outline the phone's compatibility with Daydream, Google's virtual

reality platform. He also showed off the Daydream View, Google's VR headset.
