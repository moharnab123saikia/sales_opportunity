Google is taking on the iPhone 7 with its Pixel series phones. The search giant
is not only trying to match the premium feel of Apple's devices, but also the
pricing part. As revealed by the search-giant itself on its official blog, the
Pixel phone's base model will cost you Rs 57,000. However, the blog article does
not disclose the cost of other variants. If MySmartPrice.com's product listings
are to be believed, the 128 GB storage option will be pegged at Rs 66,000. The
Pixel XL (32 GB) will set you back for Rs 67,000, whereas the top model burn a
Rs 76,000 hole in your pocket!

The Pixel is Google's first phone made inside and out by the company. I'm sure
that's reason enough for the Android fans to get excited. However, it will be
interesting to see if the handset will find many takers in the value conscious
market such as India. Especially, considering that even Apple is losing its
ground in India due to its exuberant pricing.

The Pixel and Pixel XL will be up for pre-booking starting October 13 in India.
Both these handsets are powered by the powerful Snapdragon 821 chip with 4 GB
RAM. In the photography department, you get a 12-megapixel main camera with EIS
(Electronic Image Stabilisation). For selfies, there's an 8-megapixel
front-facing camera. Other features include 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, and
A-GPS. On the software front, the Pixel phones will run Android 7.1 Nougat
out-of-the-box.
