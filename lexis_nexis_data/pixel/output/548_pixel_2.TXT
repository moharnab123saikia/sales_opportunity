Monday, November 11, 2013: The rumoured Moto G smartphone has reportedly been
spotted on the GFXBench website. According to reports, the sighting was
consistent with many of the rumours that had been heard about the smartphone in
the past, thus confirming them. Also, the leak said that the smartphone may be
coming with the new Android KitKat operating system from Google. Neither
Motorola nor Google have made any comment on the matter.

The benchmark listing on GFXBench shows that the Moto G will run on the Qualcomm
Snapdragon S4 MSM8226 quad core processor, which is based on the Cortex A7
architecture. Further, as with this processor, the device will sport the Adreno
305 graphics processing unit and a 1280 x 720 pixels screen.

Further, the fact that the KitKat OS has been seen on the benchmark listing
could mean that this smartphone, the Moto G XT1032 could be the Google Play
edition of the device. This is also suggested by the 'falcon_gpe' product name
that the listing ha shown. On the other hand, the appearance of the Android 4.4
OS could also mean that Google owner Motorola are testing the device with
KitKat, but will launch with the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean OS.

According to earlier rumours, the device will have an 11.9-cm (4.5-inch) display
along with 8 GB of internal storage and a 5 mega pixel rear camera. It also has
a 1.3 mega pixel front camera and is expected to be announced on 13 November.
