Sabrina Ellis, Google's director of product management, talks Tuesday about the

new Google Pixel smartphone during a product event in San Francisco. Replacing

Google's Nexus line, the Pixel is being offered both online and through Verizon,

with phones priced at roughly $650 for a version with a 5-inch screen and $750
