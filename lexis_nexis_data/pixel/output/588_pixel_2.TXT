new Google Pixel smartphone during a product event in San Francisco. Replacing
Google's Nexus line, the Pixel is being offered both online and through Verizon,
with phones priced at roughly $650 for a version with a 5-inch screen and $750
for the 5.5-inch version. Google promises a spectacular camera and unlimited
online storage for phones at full resolution. The Pixel is designed to showcase
a digital helper the company calls "Google Assistant."
