New Delhi, Oct. 5 -- After years of just partnering with LG, Huawei etc Google
has decided to fully enter the $400 billion market of smartphones. Alphabet
Inc.'s Google on Tuesday unveiled the Pixel and larger Pixel XL, the first
phones that were conceptualized, designed, engineered and tested in-house.

The Pixel handsets feature a Siri-like virtual assistant called Al, flashy
camera features and are the first to boast Android's new Nougat 7.1 operating
system. Pixel is expected to give major players like Apple and Samsung some
serious competition.

In addition buyers of Pixel will also get their hands on free unlimited storage
on Google Photos with photos shot at their original resolution.

A quad-core Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM and a 2770mAh battery, which
can quick charge up to seven hours in 15 minutes, power the new phone. The XL,
naturally, features a much beefier 3,450mAh. The Pixel ships with 32GB of
storage standard, which users can chose to quadruple up to 128GB.
