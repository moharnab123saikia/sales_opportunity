with the arrival of the Google Nexus 7. The new device has scored a bullseye,
hitting a hole in the market, between the Kindle and Galaxy Note on one hand and
the iPad and its rivals on the other. It is an affordable tablet that does more
than an overgrown e-reader. It costs pounds 159 for the entry level model and
runs Android 4.1.

Users can read books, play songs, watch video, send emails, surf the web and run
Apps, all at a price which significantly undercuts the current top tablets.

The 7in screen is a fair bit smaller than that of an iPad, but some users are
seeing that as an advantage when it comes to portability. With an NVIDIA Tegra 3
quad-core processor, it is fast and responsive. The 1280x 800 pixel
high-resolution display gives a good picture quality and it connects via wi-fi
or Bluetooth.

Some quality problems have been reported with a minority of deliveries,
particularly with loose screen glass and dead pixels. As purchases so far have
been on backorder through home delivery, recipients have been unable to inspect
before parting with their money.

Demand has not been affected though and finding a Nexus 7 available on the shelf
anywhere is expected to be a good while off yet.

The rush to preorder the (yet to be launched) 16Gb model, at pounds 199, has
outstripped expectations so much that Google has stopped taking orders for the
time being. The cheaper 8Gb model, though, is still currently shipping in 3-5
days from play.google.com.
