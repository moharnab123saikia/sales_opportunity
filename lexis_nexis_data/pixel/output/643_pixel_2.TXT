HYDERABAD, Oct. 29 -- For tech geeks, this was the most anticipated week after

the recent Apple iPad mini launch. But nature has played spoilsport and thanks

to Hurricane Sandy, Google's media event in New York slated for Monday has been

cancelled. Google, the rumour mills had it, was to launch its Nexus smartphone

and the Nexus 10 tablet. According to the Next Web, an online portal, the 10

inch tablet goes under the name "Codename Manta", runs Google's new Android 4.2

operating system and will offer a 2560x1600 pixel (16:10) resolution or 300

pixels per inch (PPI) compared to the new iPad's 264 PPI.



An improved version of the Nexus 7 was also said to be in the offing and of

course, the Android 4.2 operating system. So, the wait for Google Nexus 10

continues and for users in India, the wait is likely to be much longer. Google

hasn't launched even its smartphone or the Nexus 7 in India. If you are too

eager to lay your hands on these devices, you could head over to Mumbai and grab

one at one of the stores in the black market! A Nexus phone costs about '20,000!

On the other hand, the good news for Apple fans in India is that the much-hyped

iPhone 5, the fastest selling iPhone ever, will come to your nearest stores on

Nov 2.



And the price? It could be around Rs 45,000-50,000! One more thing, Apple store

is now offering its apps in rupees and not dollars. So that's some consolation!

If you are among those interested in Microsoft, the company, after unveiling its

Windows 8, will launch its Windows 8 phone on Monday. So there is something to

look forward to. Published by HT Syndication with permission from New Indian
