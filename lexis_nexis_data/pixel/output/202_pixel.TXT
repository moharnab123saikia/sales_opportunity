could be seen in the new MacBook too.

Friday, March 13, 2015: Google has announced the latest version of Chromebook
Pixel, almost after a gap of two years. The new Chromebook Pixel doesn't come
with a design overhaul though. The company has dropped the price now and it
starts at $999.

The new Pixel is available in two variants. The $999 Core i5 (2.2 GHz
Broadwell-U) version sports 8GB RAM and 32GB SSD. The second one is the $1,299
Core i7 "LS" (ludicrous speed) version (2.4 GHz Broadwell-U) and it sports 16GB
of RAM and 64GB SSD. Both machines pack Intel's HD Graphics 5500 GPU and Wi-Fi
only. But the new Pixel has no LTE option though. It packs the same keyboard
too.

The Pixel launches with the new standard for charging called USB Type C which
could be seen in the new MacBook too. The official blog
(http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2015/03/meet-updated-chromebook-pixel
-and-new.html) of Google says, "Not only does Type-C enable multi-device
charging, but it also allows high-speed data and display over the same connector
and cable. It's small enough to work with smartphones, powerful enough to charge
computers, and conveniently symmetrical."

For the time being, the new Pixel is available in the U.S. only on Google's new
online hardware store (https://store.google
