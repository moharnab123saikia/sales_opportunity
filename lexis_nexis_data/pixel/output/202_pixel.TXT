LENGTH: 249  words





The Pixel launches with the new standard for charging called USB Type C which

could be seen in the new MacBook too.



Friday, March 13, 2015: Google has announced the latest version of Chromebook

Pixel, almost after a gap of two years. The new Chromebook Pixel doesn't come

with a design overhaul though. The company has dropped the price now and it

starts at $999.



The new Pixel is available in two variants. The $999 Core i5 (2.2 GHz

Broadwell-U) version sports 8GB RAM and 32GB SSD. The second one is the $1,299

Core i7 "LS" (ludicrous speed) version (2.4 GHz Broadwell-U) and it sports 16GB

of RAM and 64GB SSD. Both machines pack Intel's HD Graphics 5500 GPU and Wi-Fi

only. But the new Pixel has no LTE option though. It packs the same keyboard

too.



The Pixel launches with the new standard for charging called USB Type C which

could be seen in the new MacBook too. The official blog

(http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2015/03/meet-updated-chromebook-pixel

-and-new.html) of Google says, "Not only does Type-C enable multi-device

charging, but it also allows high-speed data and display over the same connector

and cable. It's small enough to work with smartphones, powerful enough to charge

computers, and conveniently symmetrical."



For the time being, the new Pixel is available in the U.S. only on Google's new

online hardware store (https://store.google
