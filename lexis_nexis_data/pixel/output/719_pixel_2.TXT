According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
system, apparatus, and method of compressing video data having at least one
frame having at least one block having an array of pixels. The method includes
transforming the pixels of the at least one block into coefficients, creating a
default transmission order of the coefficients, creating an optimal transmission
order of the coefficients, comparing a coefficient position of at least one of
the coefficients in the optimal transmission order with a coefficient position
of the at least one of the coefficients in the default transmission order;
determining an update value based on the comparison, and selectively encoding
position information of the at least one of the coefficients in the optimal
transmission order based on the update value."

The patent was filed on August 30, 2012 Application no. 13/599,315
