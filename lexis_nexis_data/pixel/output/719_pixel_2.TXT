According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A

system, apparatus, and method of compressing video data having at least one

frame having at least one block having an array of pixels. The method includes

transforming the pixels of the at least one block into coefficients, creating a

default transmission order of the coefficients, creating an optimal transmission

order of the coefficients, comparing a coefficient position of at least one of

the coefficients in the optimal transmission order with a coefficient position

of the at least one of the coefficients in the default transmission order;

determining an update value based on the comparison, and selectively encoding

position information of the at least one of the coefficients in the optimal

transmission order based on the update value."



The patent was filed on August 30, 2012 Application no. 13/599,315
