ABSTRACT



Doctor and researcher discusses how he developed visualisations to illustrate

data on the developing world



FULL TEXT



At a conference called Thinking Digital, the presentation of doctor and

researcher Hans Rosling might be called Seeing Digital. If there ever was a

statistics and visualisation rock star, Hans Rosling would be it. While

teaching, he realised that his students had a 40-year-old world view. They have

a view of the developing world that didn't take into the account the level of

development those countries had achieved in the last 40 years. "They had a

Tintin-based view of the world," he said.



Working with his son and other members of his family, he developed

visualisations that showed how China, Brazil and India had caught up with the

developed world over the last 40 years based in looking at fertility rates and

life expectancy. But this outdated view of the world wasn't just among his

students, the news media had never communicated these changes, he said.



As he looked at the data and the best way to represent it, he saw how animations

could help explain these changes, showing how health and economic conditions had

changed over time. Using Flash, they were able to clearly show these trends in

powerful ways and established the  to support their work.



Moving on from health data, he also showed how interactive graphics could drill

down from comparisons between regions in the world to countries in those

regions. They even were able to dynamically drill down to variations on a

country-basis, showing variations in health between the richest and poorest 20%

of populations in countries like Brazil and Namibia.



To develop these animations, they used an iterative process, improving the

animations step-by-stop. They used game principles, putting their hours of video

gaming to good use, he joked. Usually in developing statistical visualisations,

you have the content or stat geeks and the designers, and it's a difficult

balance to be struck. They decided instead of making beautiful icons that:



...no pixel would be there just for beauty. Every pixel had to carry

information.



Challenging governments over data



The biggest problem that they ran into during developing these statistical

visualisations was getting the data. He called on governments around the world:



Statistics are paid by for the taxpayers, compiled by people paid for taxpayers.

That data should be allowed free on the net for innovators like you to use.



The Gapminder Foundation have now sold some of its software to Google but have

retained a free licence and the ability to sub-licence the software. Hans's son

and the Swedish staff have now moved to Google. Hans said some have questioned

the decision to sell the source code to Google, but he said he had wanted to

develop a service not a product. Their main goal was to push for governments to

liberate data so that innovators could use that data to develop services. He

highlighted how  in the US beginning with unemployment data.



He showed how unemployment in California compared to US unemployment overall,

and he was even able to show unemployment in Alpine County. The data showed huge

seasonal spikes. Why the wide variation? It's a ski resort.



He was asked whether governments should create a single portal for data like

Data.gov in the US or leave it to individual agencies. He replied:



The government should take all statistics - labour, financial, education and

health in one unified block - and make it downloadable every Friday afternoon

with their watermark embedded. Allow the software industry to innovate.
