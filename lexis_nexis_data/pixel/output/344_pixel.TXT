

With literally one day left before Google's big unveil of the company's new
smartphones, a UK-based retailer accidentally posted information of the upcoming
Pixel phones.

Carphone Warehouse posted on its website details about the smartphones'
specifications, reports The Next Web.

At this writing, the posts have been taken down. The retailer had listed the
Pixel as a Snapdragon 821 2.15Ghz-powered device. It had options for a 32GB and
128GB variants both with a microSD slot for extra 256GB of storage.

The Pixel's camera was listed as 12-megapixels with an f/2.0 aperture. Its
screen is a Full HD AMOLED display protected by Gorilla Glass 4. There's also an
8-megapixel front shooter for selfies. The battery was said to be a 2,770mAh
unit.

As for the Pixel XL, the now-deleted post mentioned a 5.5-inch Quad HD display,
Android Nougat 7.1, and a 3,450mAh battery, among others. Both Pixel and Pixel
XL will be available in black and white.

As the information came from a third-party retailer, these specifications could
be subject to change. However, it looks like past rumors weren't too far off the
mark after all.

Google will formally reveal the Pixel smartphones on Oct. 4. The company also
put up a website just for this event.
