

Launched on Tuesday at the Google Pixel event, Chromecast Ultra, boasts of
advanced features like 4K and High Dynamic Range (HDR) support, faster speed and
Wi-Fi improvements.

Google announced the much awaited launch of Pixel, the first 'Made by Google'
phone. The other launches of the day include Daydream - platform for high
quality mobile VR; Google Home - voice-activated speaker powered by Google
Assistant; and Chromecast Ultra - the new Chromecast with 4K and HDR support.

The features of the new Chromecast include:

Deeper colors

Chromecast Ultra supports 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision, and gives a crisper picture
with higher resolution and more vibrant colors. Right now, users can stream 4K
content from Netflix, YouTube and Vudu. Later this year, Google Play Movies & TV
will be rolling out 4K content. Even if a TV isn't 4K-ready, Chromecast Ultra
automatically optimizes TV's picture.

Faster Chromecast, with optional Ethernet port

Chromecast Ultra loads videos 1.8 times faster than other Chromecast devices and
includes major Wi-Fi improvements to support streams from full HD to Ultra HD
without a hitch. For tricky Wi-Fi environments, Google is adding Ethernet
support for a wired connection.

Old features

Users can cast the content from thousands of apps using your phone, tablet or
laptop. They can mirror any content from their Android device or from a browser
tab (using Chrome) to the TV.

Works with Google Home

Google Home, the voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant, can
control smart home devices, including Chromecast. Combined with Chromecast or
Chromecast Ultra, Google Home can control TV - completely hands free.

Google Chromecast Ultra will be available for pre-order in November in US. India
launch hasn't been announced yet.
