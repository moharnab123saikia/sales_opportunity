Galaxy S7 Edge

CNET rating: 5 stars out of 5 (Spectacular)

The good: The Galaxy S7 Edge has a gorgeous larger curved screen and larger
battery than the otherwise identical standard S7. It really is something
special. The extra navigation tools can be useful when used judiciously.

The bad: When you pile on these extra navigation tools, they slow you down
rather than speed you up. It's pricier than other good phones.

The cost: $599.99 (refurbished) to $779.99

The bottom line: The gorgeous Galaxy S7 Edge makes the best Android phone that
much better.

Samsung

Galaxy S7

CNET rating: 4.5 stars out of 5 (Outstanding)

The good: Polished design. Awesome camera. Long battery life. MicroSD storage
slot and water-resistant (again!).

The bad: Annoyingly reflective. Smudge magnet. Plastic-looking selfies even with
no filter. No removable battery, which isn't surprising, but is still a
compromise compared to 2014's S5.

The cost: $479.99 (refurbished) to $679.99

The bottom line: The fast, powerful, beautiful Galaxy S7 phone is 2016's
all-around phone to beat.

OnePlus 3

CNET rating: 4.5 stars out of 5 (Outstanding)

The good: The OnePlus 3's sharp camera, powerful processor and enduring,
quick-charging battery make a knockout combo when you factor in its low price.

The bad: The camera has a distinct bulge. Power users may be disappointed that
the phone doesn't have a swappable battery or expandable storage.

The cost: $399 to $495

The bottom line: At $400, the OnePlus 3 is the best budget Android phone you can
buy, with a premium look and feel, and performance fast enough to go
head-to-head with any high-end handset on the market.

Google Pixel

CNET rating: 4.5 stars out of 5 (Outstanding)

The good: The Google Pixel has a fantastic camera, especially in low light. It's
elegantly designed. Google Assistant takes one of the most natural, human
approaches to answering your voice.

The bad: The phone's display is dim in outdoor sunlight and its camera's Lens
Blur feature is shoddy. It's splash-resistant rather than dunkable, and it's
pricey compared to previous Google Nexus devices.

The cost: $649 to $649.99

The bottom line: If you're wary of Samsung or looking for a worthy iPhone
alternative, the Google Pixel is the high-end Android phone to get.
