Google is known for sneaking in easter eggs with all of the OS updates, and for
sure there will be one in the Google Assistant in the new Pixel and Pixel XL
smartphones.

According to a report from Ars Technica, Google Assistant will come with a quick
trivia game. All users have to do is open up Google Assistant and then say, "I'm
Feeling Lucky" to begin the game. "I'm Feeling Lucky" is a reference to the
button on Google's main site, that will take users to a random search result.
The trivia game, called Are You Feeling Lucky, comes with theme music, audience
reactions and a host that likes to throw out sharp one-liners.

The game is quite similar to the classic PC games You Dont Know Jack, which has
fast trivia questions from a snarky, but unseen host. The game also allows
multiple players where each person can  answer a question and, at the end of the
round, Google Assistant proclaims the winner. This addition is great, if you
want to spend some time with friends.
