DATELINE: Kathmandu





Kathmandu, May 10 -- To put it simply, Samsung Galaxy S4 begins where the S3

ended. At first glance, it looks a lot like its predecessor, but the new and

much improved features make the S4 a much smarter choice. So just what does the

newest Galaxy offer? A better question would be what doesn't it offer?



The S4 comes jam packed with a lot of features that will take some time to

master but once you get the hang of it, you'll not stop touching your phone.

S4's colouful 5-inch HD, 1080 super AMOLED screen is absolutely beautiful and

ideal for watching videos. With a 441 ppi pixel density, the images appear

refined, sharp, and detailed without any blur edges. Yantrick watched the

trailer of Iron Man 3 and was blown away by the precision in details of images.

Now, add a blazing quad-core processor and the S4 is your gaming heaven.



The phone runs on Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, has 2GB RAM, and comes with 16GB,

32GB, and 64GB internal memory. Although it is currently only available in 16GB

model, the internal memory can be extended using a micro SD card. The S4 comes

with basic preinstalled apps like calculators, music player, Google services

like Gmail, navigation, chrome, and also Samsung's apps like S memo, S Health, S

translator (which works much like Google translate). The speakers placed at the

rear provide fairly loud audio. But be careful not to place your hands on the

back-mounted speaker otherwise the sound gets muffled.



The screen is super sensitive and if you are too busy eating a burger when the

phone rings, don't worry about getting your set dirty. The Air gesture lets you

accept calls, browse photos or the web, and change songs with a quick sweep of

your hands across the screen and voila. The Air view, which was first featured

on the Galaxy Note II, allows you to preview mails and photos from the gallery

by simply hovering your finger above the screen. Samsung seems really determined

to turn us all into budding magicians.



Equipped with a sharp shooting 13 mega pixel camera along with a 2 mega pixel

front facing camera, the S4 is a good enough substitute for digital cameras.

Also on offer are a myriad of tricks that allow everything from dual shots to

smart pause.



At Rs 71,900, owning the new kid on the block will burn a hole in most of our

wallets. But fret not. Nabil Bank and Laxmi Bank are offering easy monthly

installments at zero per cent interest. You can even exchange your old Samsung

S2 and S3 by forking out some extra cash.



Galaxy S4 is available at Samsung Mobile Plaza, Royal Singhi Plaza, Darbar Marg.



Yantrick's verdict: if you are willing to splash some real cash for a

do-everything smart phone, then Samsung Galaxy S4 is the right pick.
