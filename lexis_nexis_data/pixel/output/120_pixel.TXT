Google has well and truly sought revenge on its rivals Apple with their latest

phone release.



They unveiled their two latest models the Google Pixel and Pixel XL during their

annual Autumn event on Tuesday night where they also announced other products

including daydream View headset, a new Chromecast and the Google Home speaker.



The tech-giant claims the biggest selling point for their new mobile models are

their new Google assistant- which is a voice activated controller, which claims

to be able to have a conversation with users.

The handsets will also provide unlimited storage for photos, and a headphone

jack which make it stand-out against competing models from Apple and Motorolla.



Google also claim by charging both Pixel models for only 15 minutes, the phones

will have seven hours of battery life. Another claim is the camera shutter speed

will make it the fastest on the market.



There are three colour options available; very silver, quite black or really

blue.
