Google's big event is all set for tomorrow, and the new Pixel phones are
expected to be launched as well. However, an early leak just gave us all the
information we need.

UK phone retailer Carphone Warehouse accidentally published product pages for
both the new Google phones early, which they now pulled, but not before
screenshots were grabbed. According to the website, both phones will come with a

 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM, microSD support and a choice of
32GB or 128GB storage. The leak also suggests that the Pixel XL features a
5.5-inch 2K AMOLED display and a 3450mAh battery, while the Pixel comes with a
less impressive sounding 5-inch Full HD screen and 2770mAh power pack.

We cant really trust these specs as some retailers often tend to fill pages with

  random information as place holders as they await final confirmation for the
manufacturer. There is still a lot more to learn about the Pixel XL and Pixel
phones, but we can wait for the event tomorrow for it.
