The tablet majors battle against each other with their affordable tablet
offerings.



Google's highly popular Nexus 7 was officially launched by ASUS in the country
last month. The affordable small display Android running powerful tablet has
received tremendous response all over the globe but due to some reasons unknown
to us, Google did not find the Indian market attractive enough to introduce its
Nexus tablet. But that is not the case anymore, the tablet is available across
Google Play (only the 16 GB Wi-Fi variant) and on ASUS stores (32 GB Wi-Fi And
3G variant) across the country.

While there are plenty of India-based tablet brands offering similar products at
an affordable price range, the obvious rival to the search-engine giant's
affordable tablet is Samsung's Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, which has been around in the
market for quite some time now. One would say that Samsung's slate is available
at a cheaper price point compared to the Nexus 7 and we could safely say that
both the devices have their pros and cons. Here we take an elaborate look at
them, both in terms of hardware and features.
