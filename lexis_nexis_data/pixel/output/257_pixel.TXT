According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "In
some implementations, a method provides color correction in images and includes
determining multiple input groups of pixels of an image based on one or more
pixel attributes of the pixels. Each of the input groups includes different
pixels of the image than the other input groups. The method determines an
individual neutral color associated with each of the input groups of pixels
based on the colors of the pixels in the associated input group. An individual
color correction associated with each of a number of output groups of pixels is
determined based on one or more neutral colors associated with the input groups.
The method applies each individual color correction to its associated output
group of pixels, including adjusting the color of pixels in each output group to
reduce color casts on the pixels."

The patent was filed on July 1, 2013 Application no. 13/933,075
