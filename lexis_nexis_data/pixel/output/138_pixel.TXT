Google Inc. unveiled a revamped line of smartphones, the first to be fully

conceptualized and designed by the tech giant in-house, marking a major

strategic departure that puts it in direct competition with Apple Inc.'s iPhone

in the premium device market.



With the new line of Pixel smartphones, Alphabet Inc's Google said it is

"getting serious" about hardware, merging several product departments that

designed the device to ensure that software - Android - and device work better

together.



Available for pre-order starting Tuesday, the aluminum-body Pixel smartphone

will come in two screen sizes: 5-inch and 5.5-inch. Each model will be available

in black and silver and have 32 gigabyte and 128GB options. Prices are US$899

(32GB) and US$1,029 (128GB) for the 5-inch, then US$1,049 (32GB) and US$1,179

(128GB) for the 5.5-inch off contract, putting the Pixel right in iPhone

territory as far as price.



Pixel's battery has a quick charging feature that Google said will get seven

hours of battery life after plugging it in for just 15 minutes. The

12.3-megapixel camera has a feature called Lens Blur that uses software to

create a shallow depth of field and bokeh effects similar to a DSLR camera.



Launching with the Pixel are Live Cases, US$50 accessories for the phone that

have a programmable shortcut button and live wallpapers. The cases are

customizable, and can include a favourite photo, place in Google Maps or even

pre-designed artwork from creators like Chris Hadfield or FAILE.



According to Google, the Pixel marks the "start of a journey" for the company

and a long-term strategy of bringing high-quality smartphones to market. While

the device sounds interesting on paper, it's the software's integration with

hardware designed by Google that the company hopes will be appealing to

consumers. For example, Pixel phones come with unlimited cloud storage for

full-resolution photos and videos. There is also a one-tap video calling feature

through Google Duo and a built-in Google Support button if a user needs help.



But the most significant example of Google integrating software and hardware is

with Google Assistant, the company's virtual assistant that was announced in the

spring and is now integrated into the new Pixel phones.



"It's sort of like a natural evolution at Google," said Gummi Hafsteinsson,

product management director at Google, in an interview with Financial Post. "

Google Search has been this interface that people can turn to for information,

and... we feel like it is time now to add a fully formed conversational

interface with Google." Right now, Assistant is available in text format within

Google's chat app Allo for Android and iOS, but the Pixel phones will see the

company doubling down on the service with voice commands and eventually

thirdparty integration. In Allo, the user can call on the text-based Assistant

in the middle of a conversation with friends or in a separate bot-like chat to

help do tasks such as book a restaurant reservation.



But with Pixel and voice commands, Hafsteinsson said users can also use Google

Assistant to help with typical phone tasks (such as crafting a text message or

reminder) or ask questions you might have used another Google app for (such as

looking for nearby cafés). In addition, Assistant will be able to recognize

what's on the screen to help you within your current context.



What makes Assistant stand out from competitors such as Apple's Siri,

Microsoft's Cortana or Amazon's Alexa, Hafsteinsson says, is it's more

conversational, capable of intelligent follow-up questions, and it can be

personalized, getting to know the user over time through interaction with your

Google account.



The amount of personal data it takes to make the most of Assistant may raise

privacy concerns for some, but Hafsteinsson said the user has full control over

what can be accessed.



Google's long-term strategy for Assistant is offering full conversational

experiences with a third party, as opposed to just accessing databases.



"For example, if I asked Assistant for an Uber, then imagine an agent

(temporarily) joins the conversation and I'm talking to them directly," said

Hafsteinsson. "We really want to build an ecosystem around helping you get

things done." !@COPYRIGHT=© 2016 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved.
