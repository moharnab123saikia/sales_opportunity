DoST's Lipad 'clearer than Google Earth'

Land developers now can't make excuses if they have built on areas prone to

floods, landslides and other geo-hazards.



The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) on Wednesday launched Lipad, a

website that provides such crucial information for free. Lipad stands for Lidar

(Light Detection and Ranging) Portal for Archiving and Distribution.



Lidar technology produces high-resolution images at 1 meter per pixel, much

clearer than Google Earth which has a resolution of 2 meters per pixel, said

Carlos Primo David, executive director of the Philippine Council for Industry,

Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development, a DOST-attached agency.



A ground image can be processed to remove obstructions like trees and buildings,

so the user can also detect underground rivers, for example, he added.



In use since 2012, Lidar has mapped out almost half of the country's total land

area, including Metro Manila, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo and parts of Eastern Visayas.



If offered commercially, the valuable data gathered by the DOST through Lipad

can cost around P600 million, David said.



At present, Lidar data are used only by the environment and public works

departments, other DOST-affiliated entities like Pagasa and Project NOAH, and

some local governments.
