Google changes its logo: try if you can spot the difference



LENGTH: 149  words





Google has changed its logo this week. We are challenging you to spot the

difference between the older logo and the new changed logo, if you can.



The change has been spotted by Reddit this week and one has to congratulate them

for this acclaimed feat.



The post says that Google has moved the second 'g' in GOOGLE to left by one

pixel and the 'l' down and left by one pixel in the new logo.



When you click on the "inspect the element" option in the Google logo, the image

shows /images/srpr/logo11w.png. This was earlier /images/srpr/logo10w.png

reports TheDrum.



One can also see that the colours have been made a bit darker.



Google spokesperson told Gizmodo in a statement "Great to see people notice and

appreciate even single-pixel changes - we tweaked the logo a little while ago to

make sure it looks its sharpest regardless of your screen resolution."



A very minor change indeed! What do you think?
