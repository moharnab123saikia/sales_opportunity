The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Google would fold the Chrome OS
into Android, spawning widespread rumors and speculation. Then Chrome and
Android VP of Engineering Hiroshi Lockheimer contradicted the Wall Street
Journal in a tweet confirming Google's commitment to Chrome OS. And a Google
spokesperson's response to my request for clarification unequivocally stated
that Google wasn't sun-setting the Chrome OS. But then again, Google CEO Sundar
Pichai, who once ran the Chrome group, has said that Chrome OS and Android would
come closer together. The controversy has been echoing ever since.

The root of this controversy is probably the high-end Chromebook Pixel C
introduced in September. The Pixel C runs Android Marshmallow 6.0 and created a
hybrid third use case, combining the unique features of both Android and Chrome
OS into a superset of both.

Here are the eight things that will help you understand the controversy for
yourself.


     ·    Chrome OS was built to provide compatibility on low-cost hardware
          running Google's Chrome browser. Chromebooks presume its users will
          have consistent access to a high-bandwidth internet connection and a
          use case limited to running all apps in a browser. Chrome OS provides
          a minimal set of OS resources that a browser needs to run, like
          storage, memory management, and connections to external services such
          as HTTPS, identity, and security.


     ·    Android was created to run immersive native mobile apps with rich
          interactions designed for the mobile internet. It's a complete
          operating system able to run many different autonomous apps, including
          the Chrome browser.


     ·    Both Chrome OS and Android system architects chose Linux as the
          foundation for their operating systems because it reduces the time to
          market and the risk of building a mobile device. Chromebook and
          Android device manufacturers gain time to market advantages too,
          because Linux has been cooperatively ported to many hardware platforms
          by system on a chip (SoC) manufacturers such as Qualcomm and Intel,
          device manufacturers like Lenovo and Samsung, and the Linux community.


     ·    Google would benefit immediately from the cost reductions from
          maintaining a single software stack of the Linux modules common to
          both Android and Chrome OS. However, there is a much bigger
          opportunity to scale Chromebooks by combining the Chrome OS and
          Android communities, especially with the device manufacturers. The
          hundreds of Android device manufacturers could quickly become
          Chromebook manufacturers.


     ·    Building apps for Android and extensions for the Chrome browser
          require entirely different skills. Android apps are built by native
          platform developers in Java and C/C++, while Chrome apps are built by
          front-end developers with HTML, CSS, and Javascript (not to be
          confused with Java). Different tools for different jobs. Android
          development targets the native features of the platform to build apps
          with rich interactions. Chrome targets the rich features of the web.


     ·    The mobile use cases for smartphones, tablets, and PCs are converging.
          So is the hardware. For example, a teardown of the new MacBook by
          iFixit revealed a mobile phone-sized system board with an Intel Core M
          mobile processor. Nearly the same hardware design could be used for a
          smartphone, tablet, Chromebook, or ultrabook. Devices are defined by
          software, not hardware.


     ·    As devices become more intelligent and the internet of things (IoT)
          emerges, many will need a user interface. Building a unique user
          interface for most applications wouldn't be justified when browsers
          are available and millions of developers understand how to program
          them. Android has been ported to every type of device, from power
          outlets to vending machines, making a merged Chrome OS and Android a
          strong and light candidate to support a Chrome browser-based user
          interface, not only for Chromebooks but for smart devices like
          refrigerators.


     ·    The Android App ecosystem has achieved large-scale efficiency, with
          over 1.5 million apps on the Google Play store. Chrome apps number in
          the tens of thousands, and could benefit from Android's scale.


Converging Android and Chrome OS into one OS that supersedes both is easier said
than done. The hardware is converging much more quickly than the use case and
the software. Chromebooks, embedded devices, and smartphones all are used
differently. The superset represented by the Pixel C is very attractive, but why
drag the overhead of all the underlying Chrome OS and Android software to an
interactive Chrome kiosk, a Chrome control panel, or a Chromebook used in an
environment where just a browser meets all the requirements?
