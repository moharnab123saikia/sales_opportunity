There's a new look to tablets these days, writes Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson



TAB-BOOK Z160



LG, $1499

****



Hybrid tablets will be hard to avoid this year, if Computex predictions prove

correct, and LG has one of the first and most compelling. The Tab-Book Z160 is a

Windows 8 computer with a vivid 11.6-inch screen, a powerful engine and a

generously sized, slide-out keyboard. Whether you can call the Tab-Book a true

tablet, at 1.25kg with a 1.9cm thickness, is debatable, but it's a highly

capable Ultrabook at minimum.



FONEPAD



ASUS, $329 (8GB)

*** 1/2



Is even a 6-inch phablet too small for you? If so, Asus has a solution in its

mighty big phone, or reasonably small tablet, the Fonepad. This 7-inch

touchscreen device has a number keypad even Mr Magoo could see. As a tablet,

it's standard 7-inch fare, with a 1.2GHz chip and 1GB RAM running Google Android

Jelly Bean software. Its 1280 x 800 pixel screen is good from an angle, thanks

to In-Plane Switching technology, it offers space for a memory card to boost its

8GB memory, and the camera offers basic snapshots and video.



SLATE 7



HP, $199



hp.com.au



***



HP's first tablet computer may live in infamy, but its most recent attempts show

promise. The Slate 7 is the latest handbag/backpack-friendly tablet from the

world's biggest computer maker and it's easy to use, offers an untouched version

of Google's Android Jelly Bean software (v4.1) and all the apps you'd expect.

Its 7-inch screen is narrower than others and, at 1024 x 600 pixels, won't

impress with its clarity, but the unit chugs along capably with a dual-core

1.6GHz chip.



SAMSUNG GALAXY MEGA



Mobicity, $699.95



mobicity.com.au



****



Is it a tablet? Is it a phone? Samsung doesn't just blur but breaks the line

between the two with the Galaxy Mega, a 6.3-inch device that dwarfs its Note

smartphone. Despite its size, the 4G Mega is still quite usable as a phone,

provided you've got the space for a 199g, 16.7cm device. It delivers useful

widgets to fill the larger display, its keyboard is easier to navigate, and

taking a photo with its 8-megapixel camera is like capturing a TV screenshot. A

slower chip and less RAM hold it back.
