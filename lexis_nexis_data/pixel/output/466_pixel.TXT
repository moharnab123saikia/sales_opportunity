LENGTH: 398  words





Google has launched its bigger tablet today with the HTC made Nexus 9. With this

Google has ditched the larger screen (10 inch) tablet and launched a new 8.9

incher.



The new tablet is a bigger bet on the tablet market, and compared to the Nexus 7

(2013) it is heavier by more than 150 grams. But Google does a good job as it

maintains the tablet at a thinner level.



The new tablet not only gets a bigger and better protected glass, but also gets

a bump in display resolution. While the previous generation use a Corning

Gorilla Glass first generation the latest tablet gets a 3rd generation Corning

Gorilla Glass protection. The 1200 x 1920 pixels of the Nexus 7 (2013) has been

increases to 2048 x 1536 pixels in the Nexus 9, but because of the bigger screen

size the pixel density remains less in the Nexus 9.



The bigger addition is in the processor of the tablet. With the Nexus 9 Google

goes back to Nvbidia again for the processor. After the Nexus 7 (2012) which was

powered by the Nvidia Tegra processor, the search giant moved to Qualcomm

Snapdragon S4Pro processor for the 2013 tablet. IKt has not come back to Nvidia

with its latest intensive graphics capable Tegra K1 processor.



The new processor is 64-bit processing capable in contrast to the 32-bit capable

processor from last year. Though the supporting RAM still remains at 2 GB, this

still make the new tablet faster.
