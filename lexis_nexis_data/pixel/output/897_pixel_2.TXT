Google Nexus 6 and Moto X (2nd gen) are both made by Motorola and share an

'almost similar' spec sheet. But the former is priced at Rs 43,999 while the

later is available at Rs 31,999. Of course, at Rs 12,000 more, the Nexus 6

offers better display, 4K camera, a better CPU, more RAM and a bit more here and

there.



But does it make sense for a regular user to spend Rs 12,000 more for the new

Nexus smartphone? Yes, but only, if you can unleash the true potential of the

Nexus 6. If you are one of those buyers who just like boasting about specs and

not using it in reality, then it makes very little sense in buying the Nexus 6.

Here is why



Design and display



Both the smartphones looks almost the same except for the fact that the Nexus 6

is larger in size. The Moto X (2014) features a 5.2-inch Full HD 1920 x 1080

pixels OLED display at a density of 424 ppi while the Nexus 6 sports a 5.96-inch

QHD 2560 x1440 pixels AMOLED display at a density of 493 ppi. The display of

both smartphones comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. So, if you need

an almost 6-inch screen then buy the Nexus 6. Or, if you are fine with 5.2-inch

screen then Moto X (2014) is okay.



Now, coming to the Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) and quad HD (2560 x1440 pixels)

battle. Well, QHD wins with ultra high resolution content. But then are you

really into 4K and QHD? Decide for yourself.



Operating system:



Of course, the Google Nexus 6 will come with the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop

operating system out of box. However, Motorola has already promised Android 5.0

Lollipop update for its Moto X (2014) smartphone. We don't know when Motorola

will roll out the update but it is expected to come soon. So, if you are okay

with stock Android 4.4.4 KitKat and willing to wait for Lollipop update, then

Moto X (2014) sounds sweet. But if you a power user and desperately want stock

Lollipop, go for Nexus 6 ASAP.



Hardware:



This one area you might have expected to get some Nexus mileage and thanks to

Motorola. For average user you really don't get much. Both the smartphones come

with quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. The Moto X (2014) runs on 2.5 GHz

Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 MSM8974-AC CPU with Andreno 330 GPU, 2 GB RAM and 16 GB

internal memory. Memory cannot be expanded.



On the other hand, the Nexus 6 features a 2.7 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon

805 processor with Adreno 420 GPU, 3GB RAM and 32 GB or 64 GB internal memory.

No external memory is supported.



The Nexus 6 advantage here is the extra RAM and internal storage. An average

user will not feel a difference when it comes to RAM, while the storage could be

used up for high-resolution videos.



Camera:



If you love hearing the word 'megapixel' then be informed that both the

smartphones sports a 13 MP rear camera and a 2MP front camera with dual LED

flash. The major differentiator is that the Nexus 6 can capture 4K videos at 30

fps while the Moto X (2014) can't.



Battery:



A bigger screen needs a bigger battery. The Nexus 6 is powered by a 3220 mAh

battery and comes with Qi wireless charging while the Moto X (2014) is powered

by a 2300 mAh. But no real advantage, as the screen will use the battery and you

might not get extra juice from the battery.



Verdict:



Yes, you are really can't compare two smartphones with a price difference of Rs

12,000. Agreed. But this comparison is more for the readers out there who feels

the Google Nexus 6 is just a larger version of the Moto X (2014). Of course,

there are several other good smartphones in this price range or even lower but

let's keep the discussion limited to these two smartphones now. So, is it worth

spending Rs 12,000 more for the new Nexus smartphone? If you pay Rs 12,000 more,

you get Android 5.0 Lollipop, QHD display, a 4K camera and a bit more here and

there.
