Google launched a new phone, a home-assistant device, a Wi-Fi router system,
streaming device and virtual-reality headset at an event Tuesday that starred
the firm's industry-leading artificial-intelligence software.

"The software's magical, and the hardware's 'Yeah, OK,' " said Forrester
Research analyst Julie Ask.

Google confirmed it will release the "Pixel" phone, which comes in two sizes and
three colour choices and has the artificial intelligence-powered "Google
Assistant" built in.

"We designed everything about Pixel from the industrial design to the user
experience," said Rick Osterloh, head of Google's newly formed hardware
division. "We're building hardware with Google Assistant at its core so you can
get things done without worrying about the underlying technology."
