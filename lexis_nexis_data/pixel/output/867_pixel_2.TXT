Google launched a new phone, a home-assistant device, a Wi-Fi router system,

streaming device and virtual-reality headset at an event Tuesday that starred

the firm's industry-leading artificial-intelligence software.



"The software's magical, and the hardware's 'Yeah, OK,' " said Forrester

Research analyst Julie Ask.



Google confirmed it will release the "Pixel" phone, which comes in two sizes and

three colour choices and has the artificial intelligence-powered "Google

Assistant" built in.



"We designed everything about Pixel from the industrial design to the user

experience," said Rick Osterloh, head of Google's newly formed hardware

division. "We're building hardware with Google Assistant at its core so you can

get things done without worrying about the underlying technology."
