

Google is getting back into making phones.

The search giant and creator of the Android operating system debuted its two
newest flagship phones -- the Pixel and the Pixel XL -- at an event in San
Francisco on Tuesday.

Google has previously helped design "Nexus" phones such as the Huawei-made Nexus
6P and LG-made Nexus 5X, but the Pixel and Pixel XL will be the first phones to
bear the Google brand, with the tagline "Phone by Google."

Their return takes aim at Samsung, the top maker of Android phones, and
iPhone-maker Apple with state-of-the art hardware and artificial
intelligence-driven software -- the feature seen as giving the edge to tech
companies vying to dominate consumers' time and spending.

From a design and specification standpoint, the two Pixel phones are similar to
other current flagship smartphones on the market, with large high- definition
displays, 12-megapixel f/2.0 rear cameras and metal bodies. Google claims the
new phone is the best smartphone camera yet.

The Pixel will offer a 5-inch display and the Pixel XL will have a 5.5-inch
screen.

The first two features Google focused on during the announcement were the Google
Assistant and the improved camera software. Assistant allows you to have
Siri-like interactions that can leverage the full power of Google's search
results and the smart integration found in things such as the Google Now
launcher.
