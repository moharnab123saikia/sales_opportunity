Google's Pixel C has had quite a tough run recently, landing awkwardly between
being a tablet or a Chromebook. People considered getting it in hopes that it
will get the Chrome OS, but instead it will be getting the Remix OS which is the
closest you can get to Chrome OS.

The Pixel C will getting Remix OS, which is a more desktop styled skin of
Android Marshmallow, which is also an option for the HTC Nexus 9. This new OS is
currently available on torrents through Remix OS's Facebook announcement post,
which is the only way you can get it. If you need help on how to get Remix OS up
and running on your Nexus 9 and Pixel C, Jide has also put together a tutorial
to help you flash the Remix OS onto the device, which you can find here.

What do you think of this new update? Will you get it for your Pixel C or Nexus
9 tablet? If you do, let us know how it is in the comments below!
