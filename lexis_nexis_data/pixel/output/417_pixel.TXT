Google's Pixel C and Nexus 9 getting new OS update



Google's Pixel C has had quite a tough run recently, landing awkwardly between

being a tablet or a Chromebook. People considered getting it in hopes that it

will get the Chrome OS, but instead it will be getting the Remix OS which is the

closest you can get to Chrome OS.



The Pixel C will getting Remix OS, which isÂ a more desktop styled skin of

Android Marshmallow, which is also an option for the HTC Nexus 9. This new OS is

currently available on torrents through Remix OS's Facebook announcement post,

which is the only way you can get it. If you need help on how to get Remix OS up

and running on your Nexus 9 and Pixel C, Jide has also put together a tutorial

to help you flash the Remix OS onto the device, which you can find here.



What do you think of this new update? Will you get it for your Pixel C or Nexus

9 tablet? If you do, let us know how it is in the comments below!
