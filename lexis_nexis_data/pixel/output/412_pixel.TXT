

Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will be sold online and through a number
of multibrand retail stores from Tuesday, as the search giant takes the plunge
into the most competitive phone market in the world.

Attacking the premium end of the market, the Pixel smartphone range will begin
from '57,000, but to attract consumers, the company will offer cash-backs and
equal monthly installment (EMI) plans from multiple banks from Tuesday.

It will go head-to-head with Apple's iPhone 7, which went on sale earlier this
month, besides Samsung's S7 and S7 Edge, which the South Korean

major is pushing after the Galaxy Note 7 debacle.

The first 'Made By Google' smartphone will be available on Flipkart and across
organised and multi-brand retail stores including Bajaj Electronics, Croma,
Ezone, Jumbo, Poorvika, Reliance Digital, Sang eetha and Vi jay Sales, the
company said in a statement on Monday.

Google entered the mobile space with its Nexus series of smartphones where it
partnered with other manufacturers such as Samsung, Asus, HTC, LG and Huawei for
design and input. But the company did not market the devices and did not attach
its own branding.
