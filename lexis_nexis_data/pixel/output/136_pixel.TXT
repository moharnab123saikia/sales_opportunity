Google Pixel now available in the UAE grey market



LENGTH: 183  words





No word on official units coming to the Middle East



If you're looking to purchase Google first smartphone, the Google Pixel and the

Google Pixel XL are now available in the UAE through grey market sellers and the

likes of dubizzle. We've put together a table on the official US pricing as well

as what it's going for at the moment.



Surprisingly, prices aren't commanding as much of a premium as the new iPhone

does- especially when you factor in taxes and shipping from the US. That being

said, we expect the prices to down by 10-15% in the next few weeks



<table><tr><td>Official Price</td><td>Grey Imports</td></tr> <tr><td>Google

Pixel 32GB</td><td>$649 / AED 2400</td><td>2900-3200</td></tr> <tr><td>Google

Pixel 128GB</td><td>$749/ AED 2750</td><td>3800-4000</td></tr> <tr><td>Google

Pixel XL 32GB</td><td>$769/ AED 2825</td><td>3300-3500</td></tr> <tr><td>Google

Pixel LX 128GB</td><td>$869/AED 3200</td><td>4200-4400</td></tr> </table>



We still don't have any info on official availability but weill certainly keep

you posted if we hear anything.
