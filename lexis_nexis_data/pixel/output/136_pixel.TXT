If you're looking to purchase Google first smartphone, the Google Pixel and the
Google Pixel XL are now available in the UAE through grey market sellers and the
likes of dubizzle. We've put together a table on the official US pricing as well
as what it's going for at the moment.

Surprisingly, prices aren't commanding as much of a premium as the new iPhone
does- especially when you factor in taxes and shipping from the US. That being
said, we expect the prices to down by 10-15% in the next few weeks

<table><tr><td>Official Price</td><td>Grey Imports</td></tr> <tr><td>Google
Pixel 32GB</td><td>$649 / AED 2400</td><td>2900-3200</td></tr> <tr><td>Google
Pixel 128GB</td><td>$749/ AED 2750</td><td>3800-4000</td></tr> <tr><td>Google
Pixel XL 32GB</td><td>$769/ AED 2825</td><td>3300-3500</td></tr> <tr><td>Google
Pixel LX 128GB</td><td>$869/AED 3200</td><td>4200-4400</td></tr> </table>

We still don't have any info on official availability but weill certainly keep
you posted if we hear anything.
