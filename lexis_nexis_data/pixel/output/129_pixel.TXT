Unlocking and Rooting your Pixel and Pixel XL is easy

Get your Pixel or Pixel XL with unlockable bootloaders from Google



Google recently revealed that its latest Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will

come packed with unlockable bootloaders, making it much easier to root the

device, as long as you get them direct from Google Store.



Rooting a phone isnt easy, but if you manage to do it, you get more control over

the device overall. You will also be able to access the deeper settings of

Android to running a new OS altogether. In the  "root only" apps on the Android

apps section of the Google Play Store, you can see apps that will help you tweak

battery life, CPU Performance or perform full phone backups, better control the

file system and more.



However, it does have security risks which leads to people steering clear from

it. On the other hand, Pixel and Pixel XL users can do it easily, thanks to new

tools Google provides. Rooting is not something everyone opts for, instead it is

something that appeals to advanced users and developers.



The phones officially go on sale on 20 October and will be priced at $649 for

the Pixel and the Pixel XL from $769 direct from Google.
