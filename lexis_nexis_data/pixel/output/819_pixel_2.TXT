to design responsive websites more efficiently.

Thursday, September 04, 2014: The pictures and photograph on website, known as
simple images are all static images. But, Google's Chrome 38 is set to change
this old concept with a new responsive element called 'picture'. This would
bring a new responsive design to the website. The responsive design renders and
scales the elements on webpage in appropriate format for the screen size.

Senior Symbolic Software Engineer at Google, Andreas Rossberg said, "The Picture
element will bring elegant solution of responsive images on the website.
Previously, users were shown a duplicate resource of image. Developers can list
multiple images under one picture element, so that browser can pick up
appropriate image according to the screen size, pixel density and other
factors".

The HTML 5.1 has replaced image tag with superset element for image containers.
Google's picture element is based on this technology in W3C HTML 5.1. The HTML
5.1 specification draft says, "The picture element has multiple ing element
resouces. It helps authors to control or hint user's browser about which image
resource to choose. These image resources are of different screen size, pixel
density, viewport size, image format and other factors".

Chrome 38 will come with 64-bit build for Mac OSX. Some Linux distributions
namely, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Debian and Red Hat already have a 64-bit beta
channel support but for Mac, this will be the first browser to provide 64-bit
build. Currently, Mac users can run Canary branch of Chrome to get a 64-bit
version of Chrome. Canary branch tends to crash every now and then. It is full
of bugs and issues. This new 64-bit build of Chrome for Mac should bring the
most stable and usable web browser for Mac platform. Chrome 37 64-bit build for
Windows is supposed to release in the same week.
