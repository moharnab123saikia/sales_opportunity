Chrome 38 Brings New Responsive Image Element- 'Picture'



LENGTH: 323  words





The Picture element is based on new image tag in HTML 5.1 that helps developers

to design responsive websites more efficiently.



Thursday, September 04, 2014: The pictures and photograph on website, known as

simple images are all static images. But, Google's Chrome 38 is set to change

this old concept with a new responsive element called 'picture'. This would

bring a new responsive design to the website. The responsive design renders and

scales the elements on webpage in appropriate format for the screen size.



Senior Symbolic Software Engineer at Google, Andreas Rossberg said, "The Picture

element will bring elegant solution of responsive images on the website.

Previously, users were shown a duplicate resource of image. Developers can list

multiple images under one picture element, so that browser can pick up

appropriate image according to the screen size, pixel density and other

factors".



The HTML 5.1 has replaced image tag with superset element for image containers.

Google's picture element is based on this technology in W3C HTML 5.1. The HTML

5.1 specification draft says, "The picture element has multiple ing element

resouces. It helps authors to control or hint user's browser about which image

resource to choose. These image resources are of different screen size, pixel

density, viewport size, image format and other factors".



Chrome 38 will come with 64-bit build for Mac OSX. Some Linux distributions

namely, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, Debian and Red Hat already have a 64-bit beta

channel support but for Mac, this will be the first browser to provide 64-bit

build. Currently, Mac users can run Canary branch of Chrome to get a 64-bit

version of Chrome. Canary branch tends to crash every now and then. It is full

of bugs and issues. This new 64-bit build of Chrome for Mac should bring the

most stable and usable web browser for Mac platform. Chrome 37 64-bit build for

Windows is supposed to release in the same week.
