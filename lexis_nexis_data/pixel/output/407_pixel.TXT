

Google powered Nexus 6 is the company's latest Smartphone in the software
giant's Nexus line, for which Google ditched LG to partner with Motorola as its
new hardware partner. In terms of specifications, the new Nexus Smartphone is
pretty different from the Nexus 5.

The Motorola-build smartphone comes with a number of new features including a
bigger and higher resolution display, as well as a better processor, a bumped up
camera, the newest Android version and more.

Here is how the new Nexus 6 is different from the previous generation Nexus
smartphone, in terms of features and specifications.

Display:

This phone sports a 5.96-inch quad HD display which accommodates 1440x2560
pixels at a pixel density of 493 pixels per inch, while the Nexus 5 comes with a
4.95-inch IPS 1920x1080 pixels resolution with 445 pixels per inch. Both the
displays get Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection.

Processor and memory:

The phone is powered by 2.7GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 quad-core processor which
incorporates Adreno 420 GPU, with 3GB of RAM and in 32GB and 64GB storage
options. The Nexus 5 runs on 2.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core chipset
with 450 MHz Adreno 330 GPU and comparatively smaller 2GB of RAM and 16GB and
32GB storage variants.

Camera:

The newest Nexus smartphone adorns a 13-megapixel rear camera with optical image
stablisation, with f/2.0 lens and is capable of shooting videos at 4K
resolution. It also gets a 2-megapixel front facing camera with 720p video
recording capabilities. The Nexus 5 on the other hand gets an 8-megapixel
primary camera with full HD video recording capabilities, and a 1.3-megapixel
secondary camera.

Software:

The Nexus 6 is powered by the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop that debuted along
with the new Nexus devices. It is the first Nexus smartphone to run the newest
Android version. The Nexus 5, on the other hand, currently runs on the latest
version of KitKat and will get the Lollipop update as and when Google will start
rolling out the update for previous generation Nexus devices.

Battery:

Nexus 6 packs a 3,220mAh battery while the Nexus 5 houses a 2,300mAh battery.
The new Nexus device also includes what Motorola calls as its Turbo Charger,
which can offer a quick burst of power by giving six hours of battery life in
just a 15-minutes-battery charge.

Dimension and weight:

Owing to its bigger display, the Nexus 6 measures 159.2 x 82.3 x 10mm in
dimension while the Nexus 5 is thinner at 8.6mm and measures in 137.9 x 69.2 x
8.6mm. The bigger size of the Nexus 6 adds to the weight, and it weighs (184
grams) quite heavier that the Nexus 5 which is pretty light on hand at 130
grams.
