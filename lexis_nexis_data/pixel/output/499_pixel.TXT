HIGHLIGHT: All attendees at Google I/O 2013's first keynote on May 15 were each

presented with a free Chromebook Pixel.





On stage at Google's annual developer conference in San Fransico, Sundar Pichai,

Google senior VP of Chrome and Android, said: "Our goal behind the Pixel was to

literally to build the best laptop possible out there. Do you have any idea why

there's one up on the screen and why I'm holding one in my hand? We are going to

give each and every one of you a brand new Pixel."



The Chromebook features a 12.85-inch high resolution IPS display (2560×1700),

equal to 239 PPI, at a 3:2 aspect ratio.



The machine also boasts an Intel Core i5 Ivy Bridge processor with Panter Point

PCH, 4GB of DDR3 RAM and 32GB of storage via an SSD bolstered by 1TB of

additional cloud storage through Google Drive.



Hot topics at this year's conference, which runs from May 15 to May 17, include

Google Glass, the future of Android, Chrome and Google's strategy to challenge

Apple.
