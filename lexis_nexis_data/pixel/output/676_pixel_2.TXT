smart devices Technology Stephen Hutcheon On the cusp of what it calls an
"inflection point" in the history of computing, Google has unveiled a conga line
of new devices in its biggest single hardware launch.

The devices -- smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a smart speaker, Wi-Fi
router and an upgraded version of its Chromecast streaming gadget -- were rolled
out at an event in San Francisco for (eventual) worldwide distribution.The
"inflection" was described by Google chief executive Sundar Pichai as the moment
at which advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have filtered
out of the labs and into real world applications.

"When I look ahead at where computing is headed, it's clear to me that we're
moving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world," Mr Pichai said.

"Our goal is build a personal Google for each and every user," he said.

Australian users will be among the first in the world to get some of the new
gear.

The new Pixel phones, Google flagship Android smartphones, will be available for
order on Google's online store. The phones will also be sold through Telstra and
JB Hi-Fi outlets.

They will comes in two sizes: a 5-inch screen and a phablet-sized 5.5-inch
screen with prices starting at $1079 -- in the same league as the latest iPhones
and top-tier Samsung phones. And they come with 3.5-millimetre headphone jacks.
