

NEW YORK Â· It's not exactly a store, but the Google "showroom" that has just
opened in New York is the Internet giant's first real-world shop and a step onto
terrain where rival Apple has excelled.

The success of the temporary storefront that Google opened in the trendy Soho
neighbourhood could help the company decide whether to follow Apple's lead and
operate its own bricks-and-mortar retail operations.

The New York pop-up shop will be open until the end of the year, and will let
people get their hands on new Google devices such as the Pixel smartphone, which
began shipping on Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones.

"This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch," Google
spokesman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening.

"We want people to come in and experience the products."

Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push
into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel and a slew of other devices
showcasing artificial intelligence prowess.

By producing both the Pixel's hardware and its Android software, Google is
making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem.

The pop-up shop also displays Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual
reality headset, a modular Wi-Fi system and a Home virtual assistant that will
challenge the Amazon Echo device.

Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to
the company's online store or to telephone operators who can take orders for
products.

A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow
and green blocks, set up to display the Internet company's trademark colours.

Only about 30 visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a
lean showing in comparison to the mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores.

Apple also has a shop in Soho, and many more across the United States and the
world.

As differences on the hardware side of premium smartphones have faded,
competitors have increasingly stressed "experiences" such as smooth access to
content or services.
