AFTER some hefty leaks last week, Google has just officially unveiled a new

collection of devices with Google Assistant - the tech giant's artificial

intelligence engine - at their core.



Chief among Google's announcements was the reveal of its new phone, called

Pixel.



The iPhone rivalling handset is available in two sizes, Pixel and Pixel XL, with

the former sporting a 5-inch 1080p screen and the larger version sporting a

5.5-inch Quad HD screen.



Both models have otherwise identical specifications. The phone is powered by the

Snapdragon 821 processor and runs on the latest Nougat release of Android.



The rear-camera has a 12.3MP resolution and a f/2.0 aperture, with HDR+

functionality, image stabilisation and the promise of the fastest shutter speeds

of any phone on the market.



All Pixel owners will also receive infinite online storage space for photos and

videos. A quick charging feature can provide up to seven hours battery life from

a 15 minute charge.



Pixel will be £599 (32GB) and £699 (128GB) and Pixel XL at £719 (32 GB) and £819

(128GB). They are now available for pre-order and on sale and in store on 20

October.
