THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, Nov. 2 -- Google is marveling its technology day-by-day and

latest in the Google's line up is Nexus 10, a 10 inch tablet that the tech

analysts expect to have the potential to affect largely in the iPad sales. The

Nexus 10 which has been made in partnership with the South Korean electronic

giant, Samsung Electronics Co will be run on Google's Android.



The features of the Google and Samsung Nexus 10 is that it will have the highest

pixel density compared to any tablet on the market. It will have a 2,560x1,600

pixel density which will place the tablet at the top and putting behind Apple

iPad's 9.7 inch display. Nexus 10 tablet is unique for watching movies or

reading magazines.



The company claims that the new tablet has the highest resolution available on

the planet.



Also another advantage is the longer battery life. Nexus 10 comes with a

powerful battery that stays upto nine hours of video playback and more than 500

hours of standby time. The front facing speakers of the tablet makes it all the

more appealing for watching movies as the sound produced is lot more clearer.



But what makes Nexus 10 unique is that it's the first truly shareable tablet.

With Android 4.2, one can add multiple users and switch between them instantly

right from the lockscreen.



The Google, Samsung Nexus 10 also features micro USB and micro HDMI ports, a

clear advantage over Apple's iPad 4, which has neither these. The dimension of

the tab is 10.4 x 6.9 x 0.35 inches weighing only 1.33 lbs. It uses 1.7 Ghz

Samsung processor, 2GB RAM which is larger than the iPad's 1GB and same as

Microsoft Surface RT.



The back camera of the Nexus 10 is 5MP photo/1080p video, with LED flash while

the front one is 1.9MP photo/720p video. Though the back camera and video

quality is same as Apple iPad, Nexus has LED flash and the front camera is

better than iPad's 1.2 MP.



The one drawback that the techies find in the Google and Samsung's 10-inch

tablet is that Google lags behind Apple in building strong collection of

tablet-oriented apps. Published by HT Syndication with permission from New
