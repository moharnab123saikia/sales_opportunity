Google is getting all set for its upcoming event on October 4th, and in addition
to the Pixel and the Pixel XL we might also see a new Chromebook and the
Chromecast Ultra. Her is a sneak peek at the Chromecast Ultra.

Courtesy of leakster Evan Blass, we have images of the new Chromcast Ultra, and
(drumroll please)..it looks just like the earlier one. The only difference we
see, in terms of physical appearance that is, is the removal of the Chrome
branding in favor of Google's increasingly used "G" logo. The device is also set
to support 4K video. It also seems to have a button at the back, which could be
a reset button.

As opposed to normal Chromecasts which cost around $35, the Chromecast Ultra is
set to hit the markets at $70. However, if you dont have a 4K TV, then we
wouldnt suggest getting the upgrade. Fingers crossed, Google might have
something up their sleeves with the Chromecast Ultra, but we will only know on
October 4th.
