New images of the Chromecast Ultra



LENGTH: 170  words





Here is what the new Chromecast Ultra would look like



Google is getting all set for its upcoming event on October 4th, and in addition

to the Pixel and the Pixel XL we might also see a new Chromebook and the

Chromecast Ultra. Her is a sneak peek at the Chromecast Ultra.



Courtesy of leakster Evan Blass, we have images of the new Chromcast Ultra, and

(drumroll please)..it looks just like the earlier one. The only difference we

see, in terms of physical appearance that is, is the removal of the Chrome

branding in favor of Google's increasingly used "G" logo. The device is also set

to support 4K video. It also seems to have a button at the back, which could be

a reset button.



As opposed to normal Chromecasts which cost around $35, the Chromecast Ultra is

set to hit the markets at $70. However, if you dont have a 4K TV, then we

wouldnt suggest getting the upgrade. Fingers crossed, Google might have

something up their sleeves with the Chromecast Ultra, but we will only know on

October 4th.
