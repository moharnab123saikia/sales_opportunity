(http://www.techtree.com/content/news/9519/lava-unveil-second-generation-android

-one-handset-next-week.html) to an event to be held on July 27 in Delhi adding

more to the rumours about the new Android One device.



The Indian retailer MySmartPrice (http://www.mysmartprice.com/mobile/lava-pixel

-v1-msp7667) has recently revealed the Lava Pixel V1, an Android 5.1.1 device

that is said to be priced at around Rs 11,349.



While nearly one year after the first Android One smartphones debuted in India,

Google has finally made its mind to give a bump in the specifications of its

Android One series.



Coming to the specs, the Lava Pixel V1 comes with a quad-core 64 bit Qualcomm

processor, 2 GB of RAM, 5.5 inch HD display with Asahi Dragon Trail glass, 32 GB

of internal memory which can be expanded via microSD card and a dual SIM card

slot.



The smartphone also comes with a 13 MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture and 5 MP

front camera with 3G network connectivity support and WiFi, Bluetooth and GPS

connectivity.



The smartphone comes with a 2,650 mAh battery and runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop.

Since the Lava Pixel V1 is part of the Android One initiative, it is guaranteed

to get at least two years' worth of Android updates straight from Google, which

should start with Android M.



However, the smartphone may disappoint a few as it is not 4G enabled, but

keeping the price point in view, we feel it is worth for what we pay.



Churning out the past a little, we all know that things didn't turn out to be

how Google actually wanted

(http://www.techtree.com/content/features/9478/why-android-one-turn-out-one-

google-needed.html) especially with the outburst of Chinese players like Xiaomi

that offered better specs in the similar price range.



The Lava Pixel V1 is definitely one of the best-looking Android One phones that

we've seen to date. The first models were somewhat plain black slabs, and while

things have gotten a bit better lately, the Pixel V1's thin bezels and

white-and-silver backside definitely make it more attractive that its

predecessors.



However, An official announcement of the Lava Pixel V1 is expected to come on

July 29.
