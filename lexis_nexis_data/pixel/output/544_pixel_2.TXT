According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Techniques are described to use a reference motion vector to reduce the amount

of bits needed to encode motion vectors for inter prediction. One method

includes identifying a candidate motion vector used to inter predict each of a

plurality of previously coded blocks to define a plurality of candidate motion

vectors, identifying a set of reconstructed pixel values corresponding to a set

of previously coded pixels for the current block, and generating, using each

candidate motion vector, a corresponding set of predicted values for the set of

previously coded pixel values within each reference frame of a plurality of

reference frames. A respective error value based on a difference between the set

of reconstructed pixel values and each set of predicted values is used to select

a reference motion vector from the candidate motion vectors that is used to

encode the motion vector for the current block."



The Patent was filed on August 23, 2013 under application No. 20150055706
