According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Techniques are described to use a reference motion vector to reduce the amount
of bits needed to encode motion vectors for inter prediction. One method
includes identifying a candidate motion vector used to inter predict each of a
plurality of previously coded blocks to define a plurality of candidate motion
vectors, identifying a set of reconstructed pixel values corresponding to a set
of previously coded pixels for the current block, and generating, using each
candidate motion vector, a corresponding set of predicted values for the set of
previously coded pixel values within each reference frame of a plurality of
reference frames. A respective error value based on a difference between the set
of reconstructed pixel values and each set of predicted values is used to select
a reference motion vector from the candidate motion vectors that is used to
encode the motion vector for the current block."

The Patent was filed on August 23, 2013 under application No. 20150055706
