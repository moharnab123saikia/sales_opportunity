Google challenges Apple with high-end laptop

Google on Thursday unveiled a touch-screen notebook computer designed for

high-end users, throwing down a gauntlet for Apple and its MacBooks.



Google said its Chromebook Pixel computers blending tablet and laptop

technology, boasting heavyweight Intel chips and screens tailored for rich

graphics, were released in the United States and Britain, starting at $1,299.



"People will give up a MacBook Air for this," Google Chrome senior vice

president Sundar Pichai said while showing off the premium end of what, to now,

were low-priced notebook computers that serve as windows to Internet-based

services.



A Pixel model featuring built-in connectivity to the Verizon mobile Internet

service will hit the market in April at a price of $1,449, according to Google.



The version available Thursday allowed connections to the Internet with wireless

hot-spot technology or cables.



"It's a great looking product," Om Malik of technology news website GigaOm said

at the Pixel debut in San Francisco.



"But Google is facing a selling problem, they have to compete on price

originally and build a developer base for a high-end product."



Google hoped people look beyond comparing Pixel prices with competitors such as

MacBooks or laptops built on Windows 8 software to see the value the

touch-screen and the massive terabyte of Google Drive online data storage

included.



"It is clear that touch is here to stay and that it is the future," Pichai said.

"I am sure every laptop will have touch in the future."



He described the Pixel screen resolution as superior to that on any laptop being

shipped today, including Apple's premium MacBook models.



Google also set out to remedy a complaint by Chrome notebook users frustrated

when trying to work with documents or spreadsheets made with Microsoft's widely

used Word or Excel software.



Within three months, Google will release Quickoffice software for handling those

types of files, according to Pichai.



The announcement adds a new dimension to the rivalry between the two tech

giants, which are in a fierce battle over smartphones and tablets.



"This is for power users we expect to live completely in the cloud," Pichai

said. "The Pixel is about pushing the state of the art."



Google custom built Pixel and is producing it with the help of electronics

manufacturers in Taiwan.



Google intended to make a profit on Pixel sales, but said the main intents were

to more deeply mesh the California-based Internet giant's money-generating

products and services into people's lives.



Pixels were also intended to set an example for other device makers to follow,

according to Pichai.



"Chrome notebooks bring the best of Google together; search, maps, Gmail, and

more just a click away," Pichai said. "And since we are obsessed with speed,

this Chromebook is screamingly fast."



Google was working with third-party application developers to tailor Pixel

programs.



"The goal is to get the Pixel in the hands of all our early adopters as well as

developers," Pichai said. "We think our ecosystem will respond well."



Google introduced the first Chromebook in mid-2010 in a challenge to Windows

operating software at the heart of Microsoft's empire.



The array of Chromebook makers has grown to include Acer, Lenovo, Samsung and

Hewlett-Packard, with previous models offered at bargain prices when compared to

high-end laptops.



When Chromebooks were first introduced, then Google chief executive Eric Schmidt

predicted that "cloud computing will define computing as we all know it" and

that the offering was a viable third option to computers built on Apple and

Windows platforms.



Shifting operating software to banks of servers on the Internet means that

Google tends to matters such as updating programs and fending off hackers and

malicious software.



Advantages include quick start-ups from disk-drive free machines and essentially

being able to dive into one's desktop data from anywhere on the Internet.



People can also share their computers, with the operating system preventing

snooping on one another.



Google remains devoted to its Android software for powering tablets and

smartphones, following two paths when it comes to Internet-synched hardware,

according to Pichai.



"So far, we have been in a world that is pretty straight forward: Chromebook

laptops and Android tablets," Pichai said. "Once you start building a touch

laptop, the lines blur but we are doing both."
