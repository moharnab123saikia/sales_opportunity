According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "In
some implementations of edge-aware smoothing, a method includes determining a
boundary map for an input image, where the boundary map associates one of
multiple different labels to each pixel of the input image, and the labels
indicate one or more edges in the input image. The method determines a set of
input pixels of the input image eligible to influence an output pixel of an
output image, the output pixel corresponding to a pixel of the input image. A
blurred pixel value for the output pixel is determined, where the blurred pixel
value is based on the set of input pixels and associated labels from the
boundary map that correspond to the set of input pixels. The associated labels
are used to reduce blurring in the output image of any of the one or more edges
present in the set of input pixels."

The patent was filed on May 14, 2013 Application no. 13/894,390
