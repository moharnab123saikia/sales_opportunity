According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
system and method for processing a satellite image to determine a terrain
boundary. Pixel data corresponding to a satellite image is obtained. For each
pixel within a subset of the pixel data, multiple image features are determined
corresponding to texture and color statistics for the pixel and neighboring
pixels, based on a feature selection process for selecting discriminative
features. An initial set of rules is generated for determining a terrain
boundary. Plural image models for applying to the pixel data are created based
on the initial set of rules. The plural image models are applied to the pixel
data to generate at least one probability map, which represents output of the
plural image models and corresponds to different terrains within the satellite
image. A binary label mask is generated for the satellite image based on the
probability map, and mask indicates segmentations corresponding to the different
terrains."

The patent was filed on April 3, 2012 Application no. 13/438,788
