Android laptops.

Friday, April 05, 2013: Earlier this week, reports emerged that Google is
working on a Android-powered laptop aka Androidbook that will be introduced in
the market later this year. But in the real world, will Android-running
notebooks succeed among users who are used to operating on the platform on their
small display smartphones (compared to laptop) and tablets? A laptop running
Android, for one, would require a touch-enabled technology, that will not be
available for cheap. Secondly, Android as a platform has succeeded mainly due to
its application (app) ecosystem, which has enabled the mobiling experience to
evolve to a whole new level.

Speaking of Android running big-display devices, we already have docking
products like the ASUS Transformer Pad, that plays the dual-function of tablet
as well as laptop. Tablets were basically seen as the portable, lighter form of
laptops, that make things easy for people on-the-go.

All these point us to the fact that Android running laptop may exist in the
market but its success is not written on stone and Google realises the fact.
But, the search-engine giant on the other hand could try integrating the Android
apps on Chromebooks.

Chrome and Android currently are being headed by Sundar Pichai and the prospect
of utilising Android apps on Chrome-OS running product like Chromebook Pixel,
could have been contemplated. Chromebook Pixel, the touch-screen based laptop
from Google, available with Android apps could be the best way to integrate the
Chrome OS and Android platform.
