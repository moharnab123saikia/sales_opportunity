According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
first set of pixels of a short exposure image and a second set of pixels of a
long exposure image may be obtained. The short exposure image may have been
captured using a short total exposure time (TET) and the long exposure image may
have been captured using a long TET. The long TET may be greater than the short
TET. The first set of pixels and the second set of pixels may be aligned. A
first pixel value of a first pixel in the first set of pixels and a second pixel
of a second pixel in the second set of pixels value may be compared. Based on
the comparison, an alignment error value for the first pixel and the second
pixel may be determined. Based at least on the alignment error value, an output
image may be provided."
