long exposure image may be obtained. The short exposure image may have been

captured using a short total exposure time (TET) and the long exposure image may

have been captured using a long TET. The long TET may be greater than the short

TET. The first set of pixels and the second set of pixels may be aligned. A

first pixel value of a first pixel in the first set of pixels and a second pixel

of a second pixel in the second set of pixels value may be compared. Based on

the comparison, an alignment error value for the first pixel and the second

pixel may be determined. Based at least on the alignment error value, an output

image may be provided."
