Tuesday, October 01, 2013: After a number of leaks, rumours and sightings on
benchmark tests, the complete specifications of the LG Nexus 5 smartphones have
finally surfaced online. The specs were first published by Myce.com, who
obtained a log file, which matches with the rumoured specifications of the
device. There is no official word though, from either Google or LG and the
release date is not yet known. It is expected to be released in October.

The specifications of the device, as seen in the log file, are as follows,

* 12.7-cm (5-inch) display with 1,920 x 1080 pixel resolution

* 2.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad core processor

* Adreno 330 GPU

* Android 4.4 KitKat

* 8 mega pixel rear camera with LED flash along with a 1.2 mega pixel front
camera* 2 GB of RAM

* 16 GB of internal storage

* 4G LTE, 3G, dual band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac

* Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC

* 2,300 mAh battery with wireless charging

The sightings in the FCC listings had already shown the presence of the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 processor and some of the other specifications, like the 12.7-cm
(5-inch) screen were also known through other rumours. So, it seems like the
only thing left to be known about the LG Google Nexus 5 is the launch date.
