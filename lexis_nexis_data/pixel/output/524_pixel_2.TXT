According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Methods and systems for calculating epipolar constraints between a plurality of

generalized cameras are provided. Each generalized camera implements two pixel

projection functions. One function converts a known pixel location into a ray

emanating from a projection center of a first camera to a point on a feature at

the pixel location. Another function converts a three dimensional point on the

feature in Euclidean space to a pixel location on a projection of the feature in

the image space of a second camera. Subsegments of along the ray are projected

onto the image space of the second camera and are subdivided until each

subsegment spans no more than one pixel in the second camera's image space. The

endpoints of all subsegments are projected into the image space of the second

camera and the discrete pixel locations of each subsegment are recorded to form

epipolar zones."
