According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Methods and systems for calculating epipolar constraints between a plurality of
generalized cameras are provided. Each generalized camera implements two pixel
projection functions. One function converts a known pixel location into a ray
emanating from a projection center of a first camera to a point on a feature at
the pixel location. Another function converts a three dimensional point on the
feature in Euclidean space to a pixel location on a projection of the feature in
the image space of a second camera. Subsegments of along the ray are projected
onto the image space of the second camera and are subdivided until each
subsegment spans no more than one pixel in the second camera's image space. The
endpoints of all subsegments are projected into the image space of the second
camera and the discrete pixel locations of each subsegment are recorded to form
epipolar zones."
