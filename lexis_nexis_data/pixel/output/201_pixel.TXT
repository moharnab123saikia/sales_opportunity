online.

It's been no small news that Google has rebranded its Nexus line to Pixel, and
plans to release two smartphones soon. While we've seen a few leaks regarding
both phones' specifications, this time around the rumours talk about the OS
inside.

A leaked benchmark test on Geekbench indicates both the upcoming PIxel and Pixel
XL smartphones will ship with Android 7.1 Nougat. In addition, the Google Pixel
will feature a 1.6GHz quad-core Snapdragon processor (likely the Snapdragon 820)
with 4GB RAM.

In other leaks, Phone Arena spotted possible renders for the Pixel and Pixel XL,
while Android Headlines, came across TPU cases available on AliExpress. Assuming
the designs on both are correct, it appears the Pixel XL will sport a
fingerprint scanner on the rear panel, similar to the Nexus 5X and 6P, The Pixel
will sport a 5-inch display, while the Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch display.

Rumours indicate the new smartphones will be launched at an event scheduled for
October 4, so perhaps we'll receive some much-needed clarity then.
