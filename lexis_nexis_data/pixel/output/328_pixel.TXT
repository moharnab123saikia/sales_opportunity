Google Pixel tablet may enter market within the year



LENGTH: 174  words





By now, it's already expected that Google will unveil the new Pixel smartphone

on Sept. 7. But it seems that the company has more surprises up its sleeve.



According to Evan Blass, known for his penchant for hardware information leaks,

Google is partnering with Huawei to build a new 7-inch tablet that may be

introduced into the market by the end of 2016, reports The Next Web.



If proven true, the tablet may also carry the Google Pixel brand as well as

Android 70 Nougat. More information about this mystery tablet could also surface

around Oct. 4, when Google unveils the long rumored, HTC-designed Google Pixel

smartphones.



The old Nexus 7 tablet made by ASUS was a success, but Google never did manage

to top it when the Nexus 9 was released in 2014. A new 7-inch tablet from the

company is interesting, to say the least, given that Android Nougat allows users

to have multiple apps running on the same screen. This larger Android device

could be just what Google needs to showcase the full potential of its operating

system's latest version.
