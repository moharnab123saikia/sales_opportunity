higher-resolution screen, according to Phandroid.com.

The specialist website is relaying leaks on the Google Play Developers Console
and on social network Weibo on an upcoming Android Wear device codenamed Smelt.

Said to have a screen with 360x360 pixels compared to the Moto 360's 320x290
pixels, the mystery smartwatch will reportedly come with WiFi as well as
Bluetooth, and it will be available with a wider selection of materials for both
the case and the strap. This next-generation Moto 360 is expected to launch
before the end of 2015.

A stylish smartwatch

Introduced in spring 2014, the Moto 360 marked a turning point in the evolution
of the emerging smartwatch market thanks to its round and elegant design, a far
cry from the more "geeky" appearance of earlier models. More in line with
traditional wristwatch style codes thanks to its steel case and leather strap,
the Android Wear gadget paved the way for a new generation of smartwatches such
as the LG Watch Urbane and the future Huawei Watch, which was presented at
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and will go on sale later this year.

The Moto 360 also stands out for the extensive customization options available
through the Moto Maker online interface, which lets users select their case
color, case size, strap and screen wallpaper.  Similar to those offered by car
brands, Motorola's configuration tool is currently the most advanced provided by
any tech manufacturer, and the customization options will almost certainly carry
over to the follow-up to the Moto 360.
