According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A

display apparatus includes an array of microlenses disposed in or on a

substrate. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes scattering centers disposed

in or on the substrate and offset relative to the microlenses. The scattering

centers are positioned substantially at focal points of the microlenses such

that light incident upon a first side the substrate is scattered off of the

scattering centers and collimated by corresponding ones of the microlenses

before emission from the display apparatus. In another embodiment, the apparatus

includes light emitting pixels disposed in or on the substrate and offset

relative to the microlenses. The light emitting pixels are positioned

substantially at focal points of the microlenses such that non-collimated light

emitted from the light emitting pixels is collimated by the microlenses upon

emission from the display apparatus."



The patent was filed on November 3, 2010 Application no. 12/938,644
