According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
display apparatus includes an array of microlenses disposed in or on a
substrate. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes scattering centers disposed
in or on the substrate and offset relative to the microlenses. The scattering
centers are positioned substantially at focal points of the microlenses such
that light incident upon a first side the substrate is scattered off of the
scattering centers and collimated by corresponding ones of the microlenses
before emission from the display apparatus. In another embodiment, the apparatus
includes light emitting pixels disposed in or on the substrate and offset
relative to the microlenses. The light emitting pixels are positioned
substantially at focal points of the microlenses such that non-collimated light
emitted from the light emitting pixels is collimated by the microlenses upon
emission from the display apparatus."

The patent was filed on November 3, 2010 Application no. 12/938,644
