Google is set to unveil two new smartphones as the technology giant aims to

challenge Samsung and Apple in the smartphone market.



The internet giant will announce the Pixel and Pixel XL as replacements for its

Nexus smartphones today, according to reports.



It has been suggested the Pixel will have a 5in display and the Pixel XL a 5.5in

screen. The devices will reportedly come with cutting-edge Snapdragon

processors, 12-megapixel cameras and fingerprint scanners.



Both phones are also expected to arrive with the latest version of Google's

Android software, 7.1 Nougat. The announcement will take place during a live

event in San Francisco, where the firm is also expected to give more information

on its smart home device, Google Home, which was announced in May.



Google Home enables users to talk to Google's artificial intelligence system to

find out news, weather and travel information, as well as control smart

appliances in their home, including lights and thermostats, using their voice.
