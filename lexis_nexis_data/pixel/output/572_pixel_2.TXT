TOP APP



UBEREATS Free, Google Android/Apple iOS Be warned: installing this app may prove

to be a dangerous game. UberEATS recently launched ina host of Australian

cities, including Brisbane, and there are many temptations within its app.

Available cuisine ranges from sushi to burgers, cakes to pizzas, and some of its

top names include Ginga, Jocelyn's Provisions, and Ze Pickle. All feature

extensive menus of food that can be delivered to your door, and each order is

tracked on a map within the app, much in the manner of a regular Uber booking,

so you can tell when the driver is in your street and outside your door.



TOP GADGET GOOGLE PIXEL XL $1269-$1419, store.google.com Google's first phone is

undeniably beautiful, and that beauty extends beneath the surface. Manufactured

by HTC, the Pixel XL's aluminium and glass exterior is seriously refined, with a

distinguishing fingerprint sensor and glass panel on the top third of its back,

curved corners, and flat edges. Its 12.3-megapixel camera also impresses, with a

smart High Dynamic Range feature and reliably even exposure. But software is

still the star of this device. Its artificially intelligent PA Google Assistant

is built into its home button, ready to deliver quizzes or factoids from the

internet; Google Now is available with one swipe; and additions such as extra

app shortcuts, and quick swipes to reveal notifications, make for a thoroughly

enjoyable user experience.



TOP ACCESSORY NIKKOR AF-S 105MM F1.4 LENS $3285, nikon.com.auCapturing a

striking portrait is never easy but this lens can seriously improve your

chances. Nikon's 105mm creation is the only lens in its class to deliver a

large, f1.4 aperture, making it a handy addition in night photography and suited

to creative lighting. It's also capable of sharp focus on an incredibly small

area (an eye, for example), and speedily, given that f1.4 aperture. The lens

itself is made from three extra low dispersion elements to minimise fringing, it

features a Nano Crystal coating to reduce ghosting, and it also produces

pleasingly minimal distortion. Enthusiasts might find its $3000 price tagand

760g weight burdensome, butit's well worth the investment.
