1. GOOGLE GLASSES Created under the moniker Project Glass, Google's wearable

technology was finally seen in the real world in April on the face of Google

co-founder Sergey Brin.



The spaceage spectacles replace one lens with a 1.3cm heads-up display offering

information otherwise seen on a smartphone screen. Google Glasses can, for

example, let users message friends, read maps and look up pub trivia answers.



Google Glass Explorer Edition will be available to app developers early next

year for $US1500.



2. MINIATURE TABLETS



Small tablets became big business this year, starting with a little something

from Google (Nexus 7) and finishing with a handbagfriendly number from Apple

(the iPad Mini).



3. LYTRO CAMERA



It's the camera that lets photographers change a photo's focus after it's been

captured. The Lytro camera, created by Australian Ren Ng, makes sophisticated

technology easy to use, as it contains a series of tiny lenses that capture

light from all angles.



4. PHONES GO LARGE



Big phones are now big business.



From the HTC One X, with its 4.7inch display, to Motorola's new 4.7inch RAZR HD,

smartphones edged closer to tablet size. Samsung retained its crown as size

leader, however, with the Galaxy Note II boasting a 5.5-inch screen.



5. 4G SPREADS



Not only did many more smartphones and mobile modems start supporting 4G this

year, but Telstra and Optus delivered LongTerm Evolution (LTE) networks to more

areas. Vodafone promises 4G next year.



6. MACS SEE RETINA



Unveiled in June, the 15-inch MacBook Pro became the first Apple Mac to receive

a Retina screen, so-named because users are unable to see individual pixels up

close. The screen features more than five million pixels, giving it a resolution

sharper than a TV.



7. MUSIC-STREAMING SERVICES



Subscription music service Rdio was joined by Rara and big-name service Spotify.

Then Telstra's MOG, Sony's Music Unlimited, Nokia Music and Microsoft's Xbox

Music started dancing to the same tune, all for a monthly subscription fee.



8. CONNECTED CAMERAS



Cameras joined the internet revolution this year.



Samsung's Galaxy Camera offers the latest Google Android software and, for the

first time, a built-in 3G connection for instant sharing.



Similarly, the Nikon Coolpix S800c features a wi-ficonnection and Android apps.



9. INSTAGRAM BOOM



This photo app launched on the Google Android system, announced it had attracted

30 million users and was bought by Facebook in a $1 billion deal in April.



10. OLED TV SCREENS



Organic light-emitting diode screens offer significantly brighter pictures,

higher contrast, smaller screen borders and significantly thinner forms.

Samsung's 55-inch screen was just 4mm thin, while LG's was just 9mm.
