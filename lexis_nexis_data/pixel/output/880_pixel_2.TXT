KATHMANDU, Sept. 17 -- With the growing demand for ICT products in the market,

domestic distributors of various brands have been busy introducing the latest

devices. While companies like Samsung, ZTE, Olive and Prolink have already

Marketed as the first Honeycomb tablet, the Optimus Pad is powered by the

Android tablet-optimized 3.0 Honeycomb platform. According to the company, the

Optimus Pad is powered by a 1 GHz dual-core processor. The dual-core processor

operates with the NVDIA Tegra 2 mobile processor.



"The tablet has been launched with a motive to acquaint our customers with the

latest innovations in the world of technology," said Ramesh Shrestha, general

manager of CG Electronics. "This is the most advanced tablet launched in the

Nepali market so far." He added that the



newly unveiled device boasts numerous new features compared to the tablets

available in the domestic market.



"All the tablets available in the market are 2G. The Optimus Pad is the first 3G

tablet to hit the Nepali market," said Shrestha. According to him, the device is

faster than other devices as it features the NVDIA Tegra 2 mobile processor.

Likewise, the tablet has a 8.9 inch high-definition touch screen with 15:9 ratio

of 1280 x 768 WXGA resolution, 3D capable multi-touch display and playback with

HDMI to please gamers, multimedia users and movie buffs. There is also a 5 mega

pixel rear camera with LED flash and 1080p HD and 3D video capture feature. The

images and videos captured by the device can be transferred to 2D and

GB inbuilt memory storage, console-quality games available through the Tegra

Zone app, Google services including Google eBooks, Google Maps 5 and Google

Talk, the company said.



The Optimus Pad is available throughout the country at an introductory price of

Rs 69,999. According to Shrestha, the company aims to sell around 50 tablets

monthly. "As our device is expensive compared to others, it is certain that

there will be a niche market for it. However, we are sure that it will be able

to entice techno lovers and customers of the high-end segment," he said.

Likewise, CG Impex
