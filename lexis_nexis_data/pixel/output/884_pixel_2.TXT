According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Methods and systems are provided allowing for background identification and

gesture recognition in video images. A computer-implemented image processing

method includes: receiving, using at least one processing circuit, a plurality

of image frames of a video; constructing, using at feast one processing circuit,

a plurality of statistical models of the plurality of image frames at a

plurality of pixel granularity levels; constructing, using at least one

processing circuit, a plurality of probabilistic models of an input image frame

at a plurality of channel granularity levels based on the plurality of

statistical models; merging at least some of the plurality of probabilistic

models based on a weighted average to form a single probability image;

determining background pixels, based on a probability threshold value, from the

single probability image; and determining whether the plurality of image frames,

when examined in a particular sequence, conveys a gesture by the object."



The Patent was filed on September 12, 2014 under application No. 20150003727
