According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Systems and methods for associating geographic coordinates with one or more
points in a digital geographic image, such as a satellite image, aerial image,
ground based image, street level image or other suitable geographic image are
provided. More particularly, a digital geographic image can be analyzed to
identify one or more features that may be suitable as measurement points for
collecting measured ground truth data. The one or more features can be described
as a mathematical model that defines image coordinates along the feature
depicted in the digital geographic image with sub-pixel accuracy. Image
coordinates can be assigned to the measurement points with sub-pixel accuracy
using the mathematical model. Collected ground truth data can then be associated
with the identified image coordinates to allow for the more precise association
of geographic coordinate information to points in the digital geographic
imagery."

The patent was filed on October 26, 2012 Application no. 13/661,598
