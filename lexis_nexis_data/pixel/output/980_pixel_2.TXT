The Pixel has Google Assistant built into its software, designed to understand
context.

At a demonstration in San Francisco, the Pixel was able to find details of a
restaurant that was mentioned in a text message - giving contact details, photos
and directions.

Google chief Sundar Pichai said: "We are evolving from a mobile first to AI
first world."
