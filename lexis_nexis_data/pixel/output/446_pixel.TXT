Google is adding a new touch to its line of Chrome laptops in an attempt to

outshine personal computers running on software made by rivals Microsoft and

Apple.



The new Chromebook Pixel includes a 13-inch display screen that responds to the

touch or swipe of the finger. That"s a key feature in Microsoft Corp."s Windows

8, a dramatic makeover of the world"s leading operating system for PCs.



The Pixel"s high-resolution screen displays 239 pixels per inch, slightly more

than Apple Inc."s MacBooks with high-resolution Retina displays.



Google will begin selling the Pixel today in its Web store, Play. A laptop with

Wi-Fi and 32 gigabytes of flash storage will sell for US$1,299. A 64-gigabyte

machine that can connect on a 4G LTE network will cost US$1,499.
