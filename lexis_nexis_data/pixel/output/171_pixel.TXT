The Samsung phone debacle has opened the door   just a crack   for Google to

make headway with its fledgling smartphone offering, Pixel, analysts said

Tuesday.



South Korea-based Samsung permanently halted production on the Galaxy Note 7

smartphonecafter reports of the phone overheating and, in some cases, catching

fire.



cItcs a huge opportunity for the Google Pixel,c said Rob Enderle, an

Oregon-based analyst who tracks the tech sector. cThe Pixel is the best phone to

take advantage of this problem. But its carrier limitations are going to offset

what would otherwise be an incredibly well-timed opportunity.c



Google faces plenty of challenges even ascthe tech behemoth maneuvers to

capitalize on Samsungcs woes.



cGoogle can use Samsungcs problems to their advantage, but they have a really

big upward climb,c said Ben Bajarin, a principal analyst with Campbell-based

Creative Strategies.



For one thing, the Pixel phone is available only for the Verizon platform and

isnct being offered for other big carriers such as Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile.



cGoogle is just starting out, and consumers still need to learn what the Pixel

phone is,c Bajarin said. cSamsungcs problems will benefit the established brands

such as Apple, LG and HTC. Established brands are very powerful things.c



Mountain View-based Google, nevertheless, has the potential to cast a mammoth

shadow over Samsung as it scrambles to reverse its misfortunes with the Galaxy

Note 7.



cSamsung has created a market for a phone like this, but doesnct have a phone

for this market,c Enderle said. cGoogle Pixel can slide right into that spot.

But the Pixel just wonct be able to take over a lot of shelf space because itcs

only available on one carrier.c



Cupertino-based Apple is certain to be the top vendor for smartphones during the

final three months of 2016, Bajarin said. That stretch that covers the vital

holiday shopping season.



cWe acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market,c Samsung said of

the recall of the phone and the halt in production cThis is to ensure that

Samsung continues to deliver the highest quality products to our customers.c
