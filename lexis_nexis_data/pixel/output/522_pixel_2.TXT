HIGHLIGHT: The search engine will also unveil a new phone from LG, an updated

operating system





Google is planning to unveil a new tablet from Samsung, a new phone from LG and

an updated operating system during its upcoming event on 29 October 2012 in New

York, US.



The search engine is also expected to unveil a new Google Nexus phone and a new

version of its existing Nexus 7 tablet that will add more memory and 3G

capabilities.



The most exciting product will be a 10-inch tablet developed with Samsung

codenamed 'Manta', according to The Telegraph.



Expected to be called Nexus 10, the device, with a 10-inch display, will feature

2560×1600 pixels resolution and a 300 ppi pixel density display, offering more

than the latest iPad display, which has a 264 ppi pixel density display.



The LG Nexus 4 mobile handset will feature a quad-core 1.5 GHz Qualcomm APQ8064

Snapdragon processor, 4.7-inch 1280 x 768 display, 2GB RAM, 16GB storage, an

8-megapixel rear-facing camera (and 1.3-megapixel front-facing snapper) and a

2100mAh battery.



Google will extend its Nexus 7 range with a 32 GB version of the device in order

to distract the concentration of customers from Microsoft and its Windows Phone

8 smartphones and Windows 8/Windows RT tablets which will be launched on 26

October.



Google's event's tagline is 'The playground is open', causing a speculation that

it will feature a range of devices.



Earlier this month, Google had revealed its plans to introduce a new

anti-malware system for its mobile OS, which is claimed to detect malicious apps

in its Google Play store as well as on the Android devices themselves.
