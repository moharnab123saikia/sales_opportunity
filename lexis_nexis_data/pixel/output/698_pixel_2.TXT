into them and Microsoft has mixed them with laptops pretty successfully.
Google's latest device, the Pixel C, tries to get into the game with a fairly
powerful processor, nice design lines, a good screen and a slick keyboard (which
costs (EURO)169 extra). The 10-inch machine has stereo speakers, 308 pixels per
inch and comes in either 32GB or 64GB variants. For those whose work or leisure
phone is an Android one, this will be a comfortable and stylish machine for
pleasure and light work. The keyboard, in particular, is impressive. It also
uses USB-C to recharge, which is very fast. On the other hand, it's going up
against a rejuvenated iPad line, which is always a big task.
