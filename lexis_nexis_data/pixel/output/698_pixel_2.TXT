'Pro' tablets are all the rage. Apple now has two of them, Samsung is getting

into them and Microsoft has mixed them with laptops pretty successfully.

Google's latest device, the Pixel C, tries to get into the game with a fairly

powerful processor, nice design lines, a good screen and a slick keyboard (which

costs (EURO)169 extra). The 10-inch machine has stereo speakers, 308 pixels per

inch and comes in either 32GB or 64GB variants. For those whose work or leisure

phone is an Android one, this will be a comfortable and stylish machine for

pleasure and light work. The keyboard, in particular, is impressive. It also

uses USB-C to recharge, which is very fast. On the other hand, it's going up

against a rejuvenated iPad line, which is always a big task.
