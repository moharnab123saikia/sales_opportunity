Srinagar, Oct. 31 -- Google in association with LG has announced the launch of

the much-rumoured Nexus 4, the newest smartphone in the Nexus line-up from

Google. The smartphone will be available starting next month in select markets.



The Nexus 4 smartphone is being made by LG Electronics and features an update to

Google's Android 4.2 system, also known as Jelly Bean (Android 4.2 is a new

flavour of Jelly Bean).



The Nexus 4 features a 4.7-inch True HD IPS Plus display with a resolution of

1280-by-768 pixels, supported by Zerogap Touch technol-ogy. The screen is

scratch resitant, and is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 2. The phone sports

an 8 megapixel camera.



It will be available to purchase in both an 8GB version and a 16GB version on

Google Play starting November 13.



The Nexus 4 is armed with Qualcomm's Snapdragon S4 Pro processor with 1.5GHz

Quad-Core Krait CPUs, and 2GB of RAM. Nexus 4 comes with the latest Google apps.

The latest version of Google Now is built-in.



"This is the first time we collaborated with LG to build a Nexus device," said

Andy Ru-bin, Senior Vice President of Mobile and Digital Content at Google.



Nexus 4 is sold unlocked and is GSM/HSPA+ compatible so it will operate on more

than 200 network providers worldwide. It will be available to purchase in both

an 8GB version and a 16GB version on Google Play starting November 13 in the US,

UK, Canada, Germany, France, Spain and Australia. Offline availability in

Europe, Central/South Americas, Asia, CIS and the Middle East will begin from

the end of November.



A 16-gigabyte model of the Nexus 4 will sell for $199 with a two-year contract

to buy phone service and Internet access from T-Mobile. A contract-free version

is available for $299 with 8 gigabytes of storage and $349 for the 16-gigabyte

model. Google is touting the Nexus 4's wireless charging capability as a major

selling point.
