its Maps app on Android . The new feature will allow users to set multiple stops
between their starting point and their destination. The stops in between are
denoted as A, B and more depending on the number of stops and also appear on the
map.

The feature also shows the total time it would take to cover the trip and lets
users rearrange the stops if required.The feature is said to be a server-side
update. This means, users need not update their Maps app for the feature to get
activated. Yes, but it may take a while for it to reach all users across the
world. There's also a redesigned timeline feature.The search giant has also
updated its note-making app Keep with a new organisational feature.The feature
will allow users to organise notes by topic like food, books, quotes and more.
Users can also later search for them using keywords. This feature is available
on both iOS , Android app as well as web version of Google Keep.Google recently
also rolled out sharper and more seamless imagery to the Maps and Google Earth
applications. The update includes photos from Landsat 8 designed by NASA and the
United States Geological Survey and "new processing techniques for sharper
images than ever before."Google claims that it is mining data from nearly a
petabyte of Landsat imagery. To put that in perspective, 700 trillion pixels is
7,000 times more pixels than the estimated number of stars in the Milky Way
Galaxy, or 70 times more pixels than the estimated number of galaxies in the
Universe.
