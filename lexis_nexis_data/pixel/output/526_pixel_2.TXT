NEW DELHI: Google has reportedly started rolling out a new Waypoint feature for

its Maps app on Android . The new feature will allow users to set multiple stops

between their starting point and their destination. The stops in between are

denoted as A, B and more depending on the number of stops and also appear on the

map.



The feature also shows the total time it would take to cover the trip and lets

users rearrange the stops if required.The feature is said to be a server-side

update. This means, users need not update their Maps app for the feature to get

activated. Yes, but it may take a while for it to reach all users across the

world. There's also a redesigned timeline feature.The search giant has also

updated its note-making app Keep with a new organisational feature.The feature

will allow users to organise notes by topic like food, books, quotes and more.

Users can also later search for them using keywords. This feature is available

on both iOS , Android app as well as web version of Google Keep.Google recently

also rolled out sharper and more seamless imagery to the Maps and Google Earth

applications. The update includes photos from Landsat 8 designed by NASA and the

United States Geological Survey and "new processing techniques for sharper

images than ever before."Google claims that it is mining data from nearly a

petabyte of Landsat imagery. To put that in perspective, 700 trillion pixels is

7,000 times more pixels than the estimated number of stars in the Milky Way

Galaxy, or 70 times more pixels than the estimated number of galaxies in the

Universe.
