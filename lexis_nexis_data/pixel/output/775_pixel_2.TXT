its latest phablet, Huawei Mate 8. The new 6-inch smartphone, which is called
Huawei's most advanced flagship smartphone, has been launched on US
Thanksgiving. In China, the phablet will go on sale in the first three months of
next year.

The upfront of Huawei Mate 8 is a LCD screen of six inches with a high
definition resolution of 1080p. It means users will have 367 pixels per inch.
That would be enough for a user, but it could not be compared with Samsung's
5.7-inch Galaxy Note 5 which gives 518 pixels per inch.

Pixels per inch could be the first thing that may prevent Huawei from doing
wonders in mobile market. Even some old phones, such as Google Nexus 6 and
Nokia's Lumia 1520, have the ability to beat pixel count of Huawei's newest
phone.

Leaving pixels aside, software of Huawei Mate 8 is up to date. It provides
latest version of android operating system, 6.0 Marshmallow. Adding to that, the
company has inserted Huawei Emotion 4.0 skin in its latest gadget.

The phablet features an octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 950 processor, which consists
of four 2.3GHz Cortex A72 chips. The phone has 3GB of RAM. Users can save huge
amount of data in 32GB or 64GB storage. For selfie lover, there is an
8-megapixel Sony job with f/2.4 aperture. The rear camera is of 16-megapixel,
which makes it a perfect smartphone to click pictures.

The phone's battery is of 4,000mAh powerhouse, which is necessary for a
slab-like 6-inch LCD screen. Another great thing about the phone is that it
supports quick charging too.
