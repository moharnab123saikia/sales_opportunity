Washington: This is your screen on retina

New Organizing Institute has issued the following news release:



This is part 3 of our 5 part tip series this week on Data and Technology. To

talk about these issues and more join us this Saturday, June 28th for UpRoots

Data and Technology. UpRoots is an unconference bringing the lessons and

collaborative spirit we share at RootsCamp year-round. You can get your tickets

here.



Over the past few years there has been an increasing trend towards

high-resolution "retina" screens. A high-DPI (dots per inch), or "retina"

display, is a display that has a significantly larger number of pixels

(individual dots that can be a mixture of red, green, and blue) per square inch,

making text and shapes appear extra crisp and clear.



Viewing text at that size, however, would be nearly impossible, so phones and

computers "scale" the image, usually by a factor of 2. Then they use algorithms

to fill in the extra pixels. Every pixel on my device is scaled to be 4 pixels

-- this means that the text is "vector" based, like the text in this email, and

it appears crisp and clear. Content in a .png or .jpg format, or "raster based,

requires that the device turns 1 pixel into 4, and it appears blurry by

comparison.



So how do we optimize for retina screens? Here are some ways that you can ensure

your content looks good:



Make all your images double the resolution. If an image in your email, or on

your website, is meant to be 300 pixels wide by 50 pixels tall, make sure the

original is 600 pixels wide by 100 pixels tall and set the 300px by 50px image

size in your HTML or CSS. This will allow both retina and non-retina browsers to

determine the best way to scale the image for the user's display.

    Default to using text. Besides just being a best practice for accessibility,

browsers will automatically render text for retina resolutions. For websites, if

you don't like the default fonts available with most browsers, try hosted

services like Google Fonts or consider paying for a webfont via Adobe Typekit.

Unfortunately there is limited support for custom fonts in emails. I recommend

adapting a default font in your email wrappers and make your logos 2x bigger.

    Make your site's icons vector-based. This is also a website-only option, but

consider defaulting to SVG (scalable vector images) for any icons or glyphs on

your website. Browsers will automatically scale these to be crisp at any

resolution.  Though you'll need to do a bit of work to support Internet Explorer

8.



A word of warning: be careful with your file sizes. It's sometimes better to

have one slightly blurry image instead of a very large image that loads slowly

on your user's mobile devices.



If you follow these rules, your content will look great at any resolution!
