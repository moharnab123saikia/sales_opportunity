GOOGLE has released a premium phone to take on Apple and Samsung, hoping

consumers will overlook some missing features and be wooed by the lure of a

phone with unlimited storage and a super smart digital assistant.



The Pixel phone costs exactly the same as an iPhone and is the first smartphone

with Google Assistant built in.Google lets you store your photos and videos in

full resolution in the Google cloud for free and a fast-charging feature gives

you an extra seven hours of life with just 15 minutes of charging. Unlike the

Samsung and Apple devices, the Pixel phones have no water resistant rating.
