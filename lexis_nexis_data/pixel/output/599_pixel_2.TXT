alongside the LG's G3 handset. The Shamu clearly seems bigger than the LG G3
which comes with a 5.5 inch display.

According to GSMArena this leak "further credence to rumors that the Shamu is
going to feature a display in the -inch ballpark."

As a matter of fact, we do not believe in the name "Shamu" taped on the back
side, but a look at the back panel does confirm that this is the Shamu. Recently
the back panel of the handset leaked against the Moto X and Moto G sporting a
bigger profile, but similar design.

Look at the back side panel of the Motorola phone. The top side of the back
panel, camera placement and camera lip design clearly resembles the Moto design
that is reflected in the Moto G and Moto X handsets.

"The phone is largely devoid of branding aside from that signature Motorola 'M'
dimple, and appears to have a black soft-touch matte plastic rear cover", says
AndroidPolice who posted the pictures online via Droid-Life.

The next Google could be called Nexus 6 or Nexus X and models or code name that
is making waves around the Internet use the name Moto S or Shamu for the
handset. This will be Google's premium device (this time made by Motorola,
instead of LG who made the Nexus 4 and 5) with a 5.9-inch QHD (25601440 pixels)
display offering a pixel density of 564 pixels per inch. It is expected to run
on a 2.65GHz Snapdragon 805 quad-core processor with Adreno 420 GPU with 3GB of
RAM, which also powers one of the variants of Samsung's Galaxy Note 4.

The handset is expected to sport a fingerprint scanner.

The phone is expected to be announced this month in October. Google could make
an announcement of the phone on thge October 16th alongside Nexus 9 and Android
L and launch it later.
