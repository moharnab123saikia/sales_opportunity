your home as well.

At an exclusive event in San Francisco this evening , the tech company revealed
its Google Home speaker.

The internet-connected speaker will answer any query you have - from football
scores to the news headlines and the weather.

It uses Google's smart "Assistant" to control things like light controls and
thermostats or music streaming services to carry out scores of tasks.

The speaker, which will come in a range of colours to match home decor, uses
artificial intelligence to learn about the user and get to know their needs,
likes and dislikes.
