

These are four of the best Android tablets on the market.

**Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1**

Sitting at the top of the Android tablet pile in the Irish market is Samsung's
Galaxy Note 10.1. Its calling card, other than a slim chassis crammed full of
top-end specs, is a stylus (the "S Pen"). You write with it on the tablet's
screen. The Galaxy Note 10.1 has a wide, bright, sharp screen boasting 1,280 x
800 pixels, a quadcore 1.4Ghz processor and 2GB of Ram and the device has 16GB
of onboard storage. If you're looking for pure power, this is your machine.

**Cost:**EUR 480

**Prestigio Multipad Prime Duo 7**

Prestigio's Multipad Prime Duo 7 is a very decent machine that sports Android
4.1 and makes a real effort not to look cheap. The tablet's screen is a
decent-quality (if smudgeable) IPS model at a resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels
(the slightly larger iPad mini has 1024 x 768 pixels). It scrolls smoothly
enough. When it comes to power and storage, the Multipad 7 is relatively well
equipped, with a 1.5Ghz dual-core processor, 1GB of Ram and 16GB of flash
memory. This is complemented by a memory card expansion slot up to 32GB. If
you're on a tight budget, this is worth a look.

**Cost:**EUR 150

**Google Nexus 7**

Google's seven-inch Nexus 7, made by Asus, is arguably the most compelling
Android tablet on the Irish market due to its reasonable price and highly
impressive specifications.

The gadget has a high definition (1,280 x 800) screen, a front-facing camera, a
quad-core, 1.3Ghz processor and 1GB of Ram - roughly the same power as an iPad
2. It also has a microphone, GPS (a high-end feature among tablets) and a
micro-USB port to connect peripheral devices. The Nexus 7 typically comes with
32GB of storage memory, a very generous amount for the price.

**Cost:**EUR 250

**Sony Xperia S**

If you're looking for something a tad stylish, Sony's upgraded 9.4-inch 16GB
Xperia Tablet S is as close as you can get to a designer Android tablet on the
Irish market. The company has focused a lot of attention on the physical
ergonomics of the gadget. The tablet thus retains its "fold-over" look, designed
to resemble a fold-over magazine. The idea is that it feels more natural to hold
in the hand. Physically, the Tablet S is the same weight and slimness as the
(slightly larger) iPad. It has two cameras, with the rear camera having an
eight-megapixel sensor.

**Cost:**EUR 400
