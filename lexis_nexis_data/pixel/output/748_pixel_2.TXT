Four Android tablets worth looking at

These are four of the best Android tablets on the market.



.....



**Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1**



Sitting at the top of the Android tablet pile in the Irish market is Samsung's

Galaxy Note 10.1. Its calling card, other than a slim chassis crammed full of

top-end specs, is a stylus (the "S Pen"). You write with it on the tablet's

screen. The Galaxy Note 10.1 has a wide, bright, sharp screen boasting 1,280 x

800 pixels, a quadcore 1.4Ghz processor and 2GB of Ram and the device has 16GB

of onboard storage. If you're looking for pure power, this is your machine.



**Cost:**EUR 480

**Prestigio Multipad Prime Duo 7**



Prestigio's Multipad Prime Duo 7 is a very decent machine that sports Android

4.1 and makes a real effort not to look cheap. The tablet's screen is a

decent-quality (if smudgeable) IPS model at a resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels

(the slightly larger iPad mini has 1024 x 768 pixels). It scrolls smoothly

enough. When it comes to power and storage, the Multipad 7 is relatively well

equipped, with a 1.5Ghz dual-core processor, 1GB of Ram and 16GB of flash

memory. This is complemented by a memory card expansion slot up to 32GB. If

you're on a tight budget, this is worth a look.



**Cost:**EUR 150

**Google Nexus 7**



Google's seven-inch Nexus 7, made by Asus, is arguably the most compelling

Android tablet on the Irish market due to its reasonable price and highly

impressive specifications.



The gadget has a high definition (1,280 x 800) screen, a front-facing camera, a

quad-core, 1.3Ghz processor and 1GB of Ram - roughly the same power as an iPad

2. It also has a microphone, GPS (a high-end feature among tablets) and a

micro-USB port to connect peripheral devices. The Nexus 7 typically comes with

32GB of storage memory, a very generous amount for the price.



**Cost:**EUR 250

**Sony Xperia S**



If you're looking for something a tad stylish, Sony's upgraded 9.4-inch 16GB

Xperia Tablet S is as close as you can get to a designer Android tablet on the

Irish market. The company has focused a lot of attention on the physical

ergonomics of the gadget. The tablet thus retains its "fold-over" look, designed

to resemble a fold-over magazine. The idea is that it feels more natural to hold

in the hand. Physically, the Tablet S is the same weight and slimness as the

(slightly larger) iPad. It has two cameras, with the rear camera having an

eight-megapixel sensor.



**Cost:**EUR 400
