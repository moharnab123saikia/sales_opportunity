According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Systems and methods are disclosed for using geographic coordinates on a
physical map. The system may include a mobile device having a processor and a
display, where the processor receives a first input that instructs a camera to
capture a digital image of a physical map. The mobile device may then display
the digital image of the physical map. The mobile device may further receive a
second input from a user interface, where the second input identifies a first
location on the digital image of the physical map. The first location may be
associated with an image pixel coordinate, and the mobile device may obtain a
geographic coordinate based on this image pixel coordinate. The mobile device
may then determine a transformation matrix based on the image pixel and
geographic coordinates. Using the determined transformation matrix, the mobile
device may determine further image pixel coordinates based on received
geographic coordinates."
