Google now a hardware company

The tech giant we know for its email services and search engine now wants to

sell us premium smartphones, a virtual reality headset, a smart speaker, a 4K

streaming device and a modular router, all centered around the AI-powered Google

Assistant.



Google opened fire on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into

hardware on Tuesday night, launching premium-priced Pixel smartphones and aslew

of other devices showcasing artifi cial intelligence prowess. The unveiling of

Google's in-house designed phone came as part of an expanded hardware move by

the US company, which also revealed details about its new "home assistant"

virtual reality headset and Wi-Fi router system.



The San Francisco event marked a shift in strategy for Google, which is

undertaking a major drive to make Google Assistant artificial intelligence

afuturistic force spanning all kinds of internet-linked devices.



"We are evolving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world," Google chief

executive Sundar Pichai said.



"Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user."



Rick Osterloh, head of a new hardware division at the California-based internet

giant, added, "We believe that the next big innovation is going to take place at

the intersection of hardware and software, with AI at the centre."



Pixel will be available with a fiveor 5.5-inch display, starting at Rs 57,000,

almost similar to the latest iPhone models. Pre-orders are set to begin on

October13 for India, with the phones set to ship by the end of the month.



By using its own name on handsets, Google is aiming for a bigger slice of the

competitive smartphone market, dominated by Samsung and Apple.



Until now, Google's flagship devices had used the Nexus brand with hardware

partners that have included China's Huawei and South Korea's LG. The California

group also sought to expand in the smartphone market by purchasing Motorola in

2011, but sold the unit less than three years later.



Unlike past smartphone alliances, Google stressed that it had complete control

of Pixel from start to finish, contracting with Taiwan-based HTC to manufacture

handsets.



"Google today demonstrated that it's finally serious about hardware," said Jan

Dawson at Jackdaw Research. "The Pixel phones are clearly being positioned as

peers to the iPhone."



The new Pixel phone is "the first phone made by Google inside and out," said

Sabrina Ellis of the Pixel product management team. By producing both the

hardware and Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple

and its tightly controlled ecosystem.



Besides being the first smartphone to ship with Google Assistant, it will come

with unlimited storage for photos and videos and be compatible with the

company's Daydream virtual reality platform.



Pixel has a "smart" camera for sublime photos, and a program to make it easy for

users to switch operating systems, a move aimed at encouraging iPhone users to

convert to Android.



However, Google may find it challenging to gain market share, analyst Patrick

Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said.



"Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated

compared to Samsung and iPhone 7," he said. "They don't exactly swing anyone

around the room."



Gartner analyst Brian Blau said "the most exciting part" of Tuesday's

announcement was the assistant, which showcases Google's strength in artificial

intelligence.



"It's a different tactic from Google, taking the stance that they want to have

that direct relationship with their customers," he said.



"It is clearly a step into Apple's world" of controlling hardware and software

and services, he added.



Google also showed off a new Daydream View headset into which compatible

smartphones can be slipped to serve as screens for virtual reality experiences.



View headsets are made of soft cloth, purportedly inspired by casual clothes.

Daydream View bundled with a controller device will be available in November,

priced at $79 in the US.



Google added to the coming hardware line-up with a modular Wi-Fi system that

lets a set of interconnected mini-modems be spread around homes to make signals

strong in all spots.



"Unlike a single, central router, multiple Google Wi-Fi points do a better job

of delivering connectivity to all parts of the home," Google executive Mario

Queiroz said. The internet giant also introduced its Google Home virtual

assistant, which will be a direct chal lenge to popular Amazon Echo devices.



Google described Home as a voice-activated assistant that enables users to tap

into the company's online capabilities to answer questions, manage tasks,

control devices in homes, stream videos and more.



"Much like Amazon Echo, Google Home is less a story about a wireless speaker and

more about a point of access to a virtual assistant," IHS Markit senior analyst

Paul Erickson said.



"Ultimately, it will be the virtual assistants that are the trump card, and

Google Assistant is expected to only grow in superiority to Alexa when it comes

to personalisation and everyday usefulness for mainstream users," he added of

Amazon Echo's voice-activated program.



Google Home was also synced to work with the freshly unveiled Chromecast Ultra

device for streaming high-resolution 4K online video to television screens.



The $129 Google Home device will be available in retail shops on November 4 in

the US.



Google hasn't announced India launch plans for either Google Home, Chromecast

Ultra, Google Wi-Fi or Daydream View.
