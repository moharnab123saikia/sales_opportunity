United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patent no. 8,824,553 on

September 2, 2014, to Google Inc (California), titled as "Video compression

method"

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A

method of compressing video data having at least one frame having at least one

block and each block having an array of pixels is provided. The method

transforms the pixels of each block into coefficients and creates an optimal

transmission order of the coefficients. The method also optimizes the speed of

processing compressed video data by partitioning the data bitstream and coding

each partition independently. The method also predicts fractional pixel motion

by selecting an interpolation method for each given plurality or block of pixels

depending upon at least one metric related to each given block and varies the

method from block to block. The method also enhances error recovery for a

current frame using a frame prior to the frame immediately before the current

frame as the only reference frame for lessening quality loss during data

transmission. Enhanced motion vector coding is also provided."



The patent was filed on November 14, 2003 Application no. 10/713,807
