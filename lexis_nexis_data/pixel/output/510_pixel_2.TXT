According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
method of compressing video data having at least one frame having at least one
block and each block having an array of pixels is provided. The method
transforms the pixels of each block into coefficients and creates an optimal
transmission order of the coefficients. The method also optimizes the speed of
processing compressed video data by partitioning the data bitstream and coding
each partition independently. The method also predicts fractional pixel motion
by selecting an interpolation method for each given plurality or block of pixels
depending upon at least one metric related to each given block and varies the
method from block to block. The method also enhances error recovery for a
current frame using a frame prior to the frame immediately before the current
frame as the only reference frame for lessening quality loss during data
transmission. Enhanced motion vector coding is also provided."

The patent was filed on November 14, 2003 Application no. 10/713,807
