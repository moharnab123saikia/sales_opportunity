Film and TV award season is upon us, and if you want to watch footage and films

on a smartphone, pick one of these models...



MICROSOFT LUMIA 950 £419.99, from www.microsoftstore.com RUNNING on Windows 10,

this phone could easily double up as a PC. In fact, the Continuum feature, when

combined with a keyboard, external monitor, mouse and Microsoft Display Dock

effectively turns the device into a regular computer. However, with a 5.2-inch

WQHD screen and 564ppi (pixel per inch) there's no need to hook it up to a

larger monitor.



HUAWEI P8, £299.99, from www.carphonewarehouse.com THIS phone certainly looks

pretty, but just like the Oscar nominees, in addition to looking sleek and

glamorous, it's packed with quality too. The 5.2-inch, 1080p Full HD Display

works a charm, and if you do want to adjust the hues, you can use the phone's

Emotion UI function which lets you adapt the colour temperature from cold to

warm.



IPHONE 6S PLUS, £619, www.fromapple.com LIKE an actor who walks away with an

Oscar every year, it's hard to top the appeal of an iPhone - and it'd be

impossible to not include the latest Apple model in the best screen awards. The

iPhone 6s Plus is a thing of beauty. It comes with a 5.5-inch Retina HD display

and 192080 pixel resolution. Yet, when it comes to this model, it's not really

about the specs but the ease of use.



GOOGLE NEXUS 5X, £299, from www.store.google.com OH, what a phone! From the

moment you turn on the Google Nexus 5X and see the colours on the wallpaper, you

just know you're in for a treat. Produced in conjunction with LG, this

smartphone (smart in both senses of the word) really does offer up a wonderful

display. The 5.2-inch full HD display screen has 424 ppi and the colours are

super sharp. As for the 12.3mp camera, it's been created to deal with bright

lights.



MOTO X FORCE, £499, www.motorola.co.uk CLUMSY people unite! There's finally a

phone that, no matter how many times you drop it, won't have to live with the

indignity of having a cracked screen. Motorola's X Force comes with the claim

that it has 'the world's first shatterproof display', which means you won't be

watching films through annoying cracks. Its display also packs a powerful punch

and there's a 5.4-inch AMOLED Quad HD display with 540ppi.



SONY XPERIA Z5 PREMIUM, £599, www.sonymobile.com GIVEN Sony produce great TVs,

it's not surprising its Xperia Z5 Premium phone focuses on ensuring its display

is of the highest quality. When you take into account its ppi is 806 (its

competitors are around the 400-500 mark) it's hard to argue this isn't the

market leader in screen display.
