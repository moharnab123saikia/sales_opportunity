

The HPChromebook 13 can be docked.

NEW YORK HP unveiled a handsome new Chromebook on Thursday that invites
comparisons with Apple's MacBook Air on thinness and lightness, and Google's own
Pixel tablet as far as a high-end machine based on Google's cloud-based Chrome
operating system.

Several other laptop manufacturers also produce Chromebooks built on the Chrome
OS for computers. Chrome is distinct from the Android OS that Google and its
partners employ on smartphones and tablets.

HP says the new machine is the first Chromebook to run Intel's latest 6th
generation Core M processor and the first

to offer a docking

solution for a

Chromebook based

on the emerging USB-C standard, accomplished through

a $199 compact Docking Station accessory.

During my brief time getting to try it out during at event at Google's Chelsea
Market offices in New York City, I didn't get to crank up the volume, but it
also promises top sound through Bang & Olufsen. Called Chrome-book 13 and
constructed of a brushed anodized aluminum

body, the new computer is

about half an inch

thin and weighs under 3 pounds. The base

unit starts at $499. Of course, with more robust specs, the price of Chromebook
13 can climb north of a grand.

The 13.3-inch display with QHD resolution looks impressive, though there is no
current touchscreen option, something I frequently take advantage of with Pixel.

My brief reaction typing on the Chromebook 13 keyboard was very positive. So was
my reaction to the way it feels.

During Thursday's press event, HP and Google emphasized Chromebook 13's use in
enterprise environments and demonstrated how the docked unit could drive full
"virtualized" (through Citrix) versions of Excel and PowerPoint on one monitor
and an Android version of Ever-note on another, with no visible lag in
performance. But they also plan to sell the computers for home and educational
use.
