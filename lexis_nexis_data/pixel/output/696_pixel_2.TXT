New Products - Miscellaneous: Smallest 3D Camera in the World Brings Augmented

Reality to Smartphones



LENGTH: 256  words





Lenovo is supposedly the first manufacturer worldwide to bring Tango technology

to a consumer product. Google's technology that allows devices to understand

spatial information is an exclusive feature in the PHAB2 Pro smartphone. Based

on the Time-of-Flight principle, the REAL3 image sensor chip from Infineon

Technologies AG equips the smartphone with a three-dimensional perception of the

surroundings in real-time. Infineon provides the only image sensor chip

worldwide that meets Google's specifications.







The sensor chip was developed in Graz, Austria, a global Infineon competence

centre for advanced semiconductor solutions combining analogue and digital

signal processing with high data rates. It integrates the pixel array, the

control circuitry, ADCs and the digital high-speed interface on a single chip.

The development was made in cooperation with pmdtechnologies, a leading global

provider of the Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology.



This measuring principle involves infrared light. For each of its pixels, the 3D

image sensor chip measures the time the light takes to travel from the camera to

the object and back again. Each pixel detects the brightness value of the

objects. Compared to other technologies, the ToF technology from pmdtechnologies

offers the best spatial resolution and highest robustness, both mechanically and

in relation to background light. Yet, it has the lowest current consumption and

size. Thus, the camera is currently the smallest 3D camera worldwide, company

sources claim.
