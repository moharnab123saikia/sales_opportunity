to a consumer product. Google's technology that allows devices to understand
spatial information is an exclusive feature in the PHAB2 Pro smartphone. Based
on the Time-of-Flight principle, the REAL3 image sensor chip from Infineon
Technologies AG equips the smartphone with a three-dimensional perception of the
surroundings in real-time. Infineon provides the only image sensor chip
worldwide that meets Google's specifications.



The sensor chip was developed in Graz, Austria, a global Infineon competence
centre for advanced semiconductor solutions combining analogue and digital
signal processing with high data rates. It integrates the pixel array, the
control circuitry, ADCs and the digital high-speed interface on a single chip.
The development was made in cooperation with pmdtechnologies, a leading global
provider of the Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology.

This measuring principle involves infrared light. For each of its pixels, the 3D
image sensor chip measures the time the light takes to travel from the camera to
the object and back again. Each pixel detects the brightness value of the
objects. Compared to other technologies, the ToF technology from pmdtechnologies
offers the best spatial resolution and highest robustness, both mechanically and
in relation to background light. Yet, it has the lowest current consumption and
size. Thus, the camera is currently the smallest 3D camera worldwide, company
sources claim.
