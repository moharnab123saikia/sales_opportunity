According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
system and techniques for converting a source image frame in a particular YUV
format to another YUV format is presented. The system can include a texture
component, a luminance component, and a chrominance component. The texture
component can be configured to generate luminance input pixels and chrominance
input pixels from the source image. The luminance input pixels can each include
a luma component and the chrominance input pixels can each include a first
chroma component and a second chroma component. The luminance component can be
configured to generate luminance output pixels, where the luminance output
pixels can each include a group of luminance input pixels. The chrominance
component can be configured to generate chrominance output pixels, where the
chrominance output pixels can each include a group of first chroma components or
a group of second chroma components."

The patent was filed on February 21, 2012 Application no. 13/401,789
