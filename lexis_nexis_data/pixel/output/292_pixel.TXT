United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patent no. 8,947,449, on

February 03, 2015, to Google Inc. (California), titled as "Color space

conversion between semi-planar YUV and planar YUV formats"



Inventors: Dodd; Michael (Seattle, WA)

Assignee: Google Inc. (Mountain View, CA)



According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A

system and techniques for converting a source image frame in a particular YUV

format to another YUV format is presented. The system can include a texture

component, a luminance component, and a chrominance component. The texture

component can be configured to generate luminance input pixels and chrominance

input pixels from the source image. The luminance input pixels can each include

a luma component and the chrominance input pixels can each include a first

chroma component and a second chroma component. The luminance component can be

configured to generate luminance output pixels, where the luminance output

pixels can each include a group of luminance input pixels. The chrominance

component can be configured to generate chrominance output pixels, where the

chrominance output pixels can each include a group of first chroma components or

a group of second chroma components."



The patent was filed on February 21, 2012 Application no. 13/401,789
