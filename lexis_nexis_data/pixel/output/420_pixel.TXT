
DATELINE: New Delhi


New Delhi, Oct. 3 -- Internet giant Google's newly-launched Nexus smartphones
will start selling in India between October 10-14, two days before the latest
iPhones go on sale in the country.

According to sources, the new Nexus smartphones -- Huawei Nexus 6P and LG Nexus
5X -- priced in the US at $499 (Rs32,450) and $379 (Rs24,650) will be launched
on October 13.

The move by Google could be seen as an effect of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
two-day visit to the West Coast in the US during which he met the
newly-appointed Indian-born Google chief executive Sundar Pichai.

Before and after meeting the prime minister, Pichai had voiced Google's support
for initiatives like Digital India and Skill India.

Google, which launched the phones on September 29 in San Francisco, said that
the new devices would come with Type-C USB, fingerprint sensor, large 1.55
micron pixels camera sensor and will run the latest Android operating system
Marshmallow.

The Nexus 6P, which has a 5.7 inch screen running at 1,440 pixels resolution
along with 518 pixels per inch support, comes with a 12.3 megapixel rear camera
with a f/2.0 aperture and laser auto-focus.

The LG Nexus 5X, on the other hand, comes with a 64-bit Snapdragon 808 processor
with a 2 GB RAM unit. The 5X has a 1,080 pixels display protected by Gorilla
Glass 3 and a new 12 megapixel rear camera with 4K resolution video support. It
will draw power from a 2,700 mAH battery.
