At an event yesterday, Google announced launch of 5 new devices. The premium

Smartphone Nexus 6P, Mid-range phone Nexus 5X, 2nd Gen Chromecast, Chromecast

Audio & a tablet-Laptop combo Pixel C. While the Nexus 6P and 5X phone launch

was very much expected, the three other devices were pleasant surprise for the

audiences worldwide!



Let us look at each of these devices in more detail:



Nexus 6P Smartphone



The Nexus 6P is arguably the most premium and polished smartphone to be launched

by Google. The phone has been developed in partnership with Huawei



The smartphone has a smaller 5.7-inch screen compared to its predecessor, but

features high-resolution WQHD (2560X1440) AMOLED display with 518 ppi color

depth and front-facing stereo speakers - all housed in a contoured aluminum

body. This all-metal design phone comes with newest Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS.



Under the hood Nexus 6P is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 v2.1, 2.0 GHz

Octa-core 64-bit processor coupled with Adreno 430 GPU. The phone has 3GB of RAM

(Most people were expecting this to be 4GB RAM) and 3,450 mAh battery that

supports fast charging.



With just 7.3mm thickness, Nexus P is also one of the slimmest phones. However,

at 178 grams the all-metal body does bring some additional weight in your hands.

The phone comes in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB variants



The camera on this phone is expected to be the best compared to all previous

Nexus phones. The 6P comes with a 12.3 megapixel rear and 8mp front snapper! The

camera supports IR assisted laser focus and can record 4K and slow motion

videos!



Price:32Gb for $499, 64GB for $549 and 128GB for $649 (In India prices start

from Rs. 39,999 for 32GB)



Availability: While pre-orders in US have already started, it is expected that

Google will extend it other markets like India in coming weeks



Nexus 5X Smartphone



The Nexus 5X is the smaller and cheaper version of 6P with specifications that

are notch below. The phone has been developed in partnership with LG.



The smartphone has a 5.2-inch screen featuring Full HD (1920X1080) LCD display

with 423 ppi color depth and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection - however,

unlike 6P it has injection molded polycarbonate body. This phone too comes with

newest Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS.



Under the hood Nexus 5X is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 1.8 GHz hexa-core

64-bit processor coupled with Adreno 418 GPU. The phone has a lower 2GB of RAM

(This should have been be 3GB RAM) and 27,00 mAh battery that supports fast

charging too.



At 7.9mm thickness5X is thicker than 6P, however, it is much lighter at 136

grams due to its poly-carbonate body. The phone comes in 16GBand 32GB variants

only



While all other specifications are notch lower on 5X, the camera remains the

same as in case of 6P!



Price:16Gb for $379, 32GB for $429 (In India prices start from Rs. 31,999 for

16GB)



Availability: While pre-orders in US have already started, it is expected that

Google will extend it other markets like India in coming weeks



The New Chromecast



Chromecast has revamped its shape and form in it's second avatar. It is no more

a USB stick like device. It now has a circular body and comes in bright colors.

Google has said that the new Chromecast will offer higher resolution content and

much faster streaming rates. So, you can see your videos much clearer and

without much of buffering. It casts 1080P full HD videos by default, if

available.



Not only that, the new Chromecast (https://store.google

.com/product/chromecast_2015) connects much faster to the TV through its fast

play feature. The device is improved in all other aspects as well such as

improved content discovery, universal search for apps and boasts of better Wi-Fi

strength



We cannot wait to get our hands on the new Chromecast



Price:$35 in the US



Availability: There is no mention of when it will be available in India or other

countries than in US



Chromecast Audio



Chromecast Audio essentially makes any normal audio speakers wireless on to

which you can cast audio from any mobile device. Just connect Chromecast Audio,

and cast your music onto the speakers.



Chromecast Audio works with iPhone, iPad and Android devices, plus Chromebook,

Mac, and Windows laptops.



Price:$35 in the US



Availability: There is no mention of when it will be available in India or other

countries than in US



Pixel C



A completely new product, Pixel C is Google's first Tablet-cum-laptop offering.

The Pixel C does have some great specifications as well. The device runs on

Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS and has a 10.2-inch display with 2560x1800p

resolution and 500 nits brightness.



Under the hood it has a quad-core Tegra X1 processor with 3GB RAM. As far as the

storage goes, it comes in 32GB and 64GB variants. Surprisingly, the keyboard

does not come with the tablet, and needs to be purchased separately.



In our view given the cost, Pixel C is not something that many buyers would

really buy.



Price:$499 for 32GB, $599 for 64G. $149 for keyboard



Availability: No Official launch date announced as yet, and is expected to be

available this Holiday season
