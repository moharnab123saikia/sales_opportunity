THE SUN TESTS GOOGLE'S NEW TABLET

GOOGLE'S bargain tablet to rival the iPad was revealed last night - and The Sun

was given a chance to try it out.



The Nexus 7 will cost £159 when it launches in the UK, compared to the

top-selling Apple device which is priced from £399.



At double the price, the Nexus 7 would be a good deal but at £159 it is likely

to be under more Christmas trees than the iPad.



But have Google cut corners? While the 7in screen is smaller and less detailed

than the iPad, its size makes it easier to hold.



The camera won't produce mind-blowing snaps but it is fine for a video chat.



Previously, cheap tablets were sluggish and unresponsive - this isn't. It is

fast for web browsing, easy to set up emails and perfect for Twitter, Facebook

and iPlayer.



It is also ideal for watching films, reading eBooks, listening to music and

playing games. Content is linked to Google Play - their version of Apple's

iTunes   which stores everything in the "cloud", so you can get at it whenever

you want.



So how have Google managed to do all this at a third of the price?



It is mainly because they don't need to make money from the device - they just

want more people to use their Android system.



Tablets are the fastest growing market for computer devices. Google want to

catch Apple, and Microsoft are releasing their Surface gizmo too.



Patrick Goss, editor of techradar.com, said: "It's going to be a fascinating

battle."
