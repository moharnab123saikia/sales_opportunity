United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patent no. 8,553,998 on
October 08, 2013, to Google Inc (California), titled as "Depthmap compression
using a primitive"

Inventors:  Hernandez Esteban; Carlos (Kirkland, WA)
Assignee:  Google Inc. (Mountain View, CA)

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Systems and methods for compressing a depthmap are provided. In some aspects, a
system includes an encoding module configured to group a plurality of pixels of
a depthmap. Each grouped pixel of the depthmap includes a depth value and is
associated with an optic ray aligned with a camera capturing the depthmap. Each
of the plurality of depth values is within a predetermined offset from one
another. The encoding module is further configured to generate a primitive based
on the grouped plurality of pixels. The primitive includes an identification
value. Each of the plurality of optic rays intersects a corresponding portion of
the primitive. The encoding module is further configured to transform the
depthmap based on the primitive. Each grouped pixel of the transformed depthmap
includes the identification value. The system also includes a compression module
configured to compress the transformed depthmap."

The patent was filed on November 22, 2011 Application no. 13/303,095
