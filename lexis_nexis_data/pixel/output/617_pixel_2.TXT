New Google Andromeda OS To Be Teased On October 4

The new combined OS Andromeda might be announced at the Google event to be held

on October 4, alongside new flagship smartphone devices.



Andromeda, the purported new combined OS of Android and Chrome OS, just might

make a teaser appearance on Google's October 4 event. Though it will be held to

garner attention towards the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones (running on Android

7.1 Nougat), which is another new branding from Google to replace the Nexus

series, it just could pull of a surprise teaser for the tech world with the

Andromeda OS, especially if Hiroshi Lockheimer, the SVP of Android, Chrome OS

and Play, is to be taken seriously. In a slightly cryptic tweet, he mentioned,

"We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8

years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016." The speculation for the same

had actually started by a report last year, which said that Google would be

unveiling a new OS, and whose other predictions turned out mostly true.



Like most new creations, the name for the new OS is being kept under wraps, and

is called Andromeda, as a code name. The aim of the OS is being pitched as

Google's effort to bring Android to the laptop and convertible devices, but

would ideally be successful, if they worked like Chrome OS interface. Hence, the

conclusion of assuming Andromeda to be a combo OS of Android and Chrome OS, is

not entirely wishful thinking.

Other sources like 9to5Google, quoting unnamed sources, says that the Andromeda

is currently being tested on the 2 year old Nexus 9 tablet. There have actually

been several mentions of the combined OS on the Android 7.0 Nougat AOSP source

code. With the tests being conducted, SurfaceCompositionTest.java, which is

perhaps a graphics performance measurement tool, mentions that Andromeda would

need a performance score of 8.0 which is double to that of Android's 4.0.



However, while testing on the Nexus 9 tablet, the scores touched 8.8, which

hopefully is above Google's own requirement. Another slightly confusing mention

on the same platform says, "Detect Andromeda devices by having free-form window

management feature," which as it turns out, happens to be Android Nougat 7.0

salient features. However, till the October 4th event gets over, the speculation

on Android forums will continue to generate interest. Till then, Pixel is the

center of Google attention, where it seems they would bring back the 'restart'

option in Android. Would be interesting to see however, in which avatar it

comes.
