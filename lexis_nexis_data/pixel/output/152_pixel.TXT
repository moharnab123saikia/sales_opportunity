GOOGLE'S Chromebook Pixel is a mysterious beast.



The Chromebook Pixel computer, a made-by-Google exercise in staggering specs,

was first released in 2013 as the top-of-the-line Chromebook, a laptop that runs

Google's Chrome operating system. Most Chromebooks sell for $250 to $500, but

the Pixel came out at an eye-popping $1,300.



The original Pixel included mostly top-of-the-line technology and some indulgent

impracticalities, like an extremely high-resolution multitouch display. Yet it

was burdened with outdated connection ports, mediocre battery life and a

web-only operating system that baffled some users.



Now, the second-edition Chromebook Pixel has arrived. It's just as confounding

as the first, and, oddly, just as appealing.



The second-generation Pixel, like the original, is made of squared-off aluminum.

And it has a complete lack of visible screws and vents. It feels solid -- too

solid, in fact, at a beefy 3.3 pounds.



Its high-resolution screen has higher pixel density than an Apple Retina

display, and it's still a touch screen. That's a novelty that you'll rarely use,

unless you need to pinch and zoom, in which case it's unbelievably useful. (But

then you'll need to immediately reach for a chamois to wipe down the display.)



In terms of speed and power, the Pixel is impressive, to say the least. It comes

in two models, and Google refers to the higher-priced version as the ''LS''

model, short for Ludicrous Speed. How Google of them. Those prices are a bit

lower than they were for the previous version, but the Pixel is still an

expensive laptop at $1,000 for the base model and $1,300 for the faster one.



The Chrome operating system has matured to where it's not only usable but feels

somewhat similar to the Mac or Windows operating system, as long as you

primarily use your laptop for email and web surfing.



Its battery life is said to be greatly improved -- about 12 hours of consistent

use, according to Google. And in a cute touch, a strip on the laptop's cover

displays how much power is left if you tap on it while the lid is closed.



Certain other quirks will take getting used to or might never be considered

valuable. For example, Google has replaced the caps lock key with a dedicated

search key on its otherwise excellent keyboard. The keyboard, by the way, is

backlit -- and the light fades when you take your hands off it and comes up

again when you come close.



But all of that said, the Pixel is not really meant to be a device for the

masses to buy; its specs, its price and its usability aren't really the goals.

It is, by Google's own admission, a device meant to test and demonstrate

improvements that could eventually find their way into cheaper Chromebooks --

whether those are outward-facing hardware improvements like better trackpads or

power efficiencies that lead to longer battery life.



In the case of the second-generation Pixel, the big, flashy proof-of-concept

feature is its all-in-one connection port, known as USB Type-C (try typing that

without a caps lock key).



The new connection replaces not only older USB ports, but also the power input

and display-out ports commonly found on laptops. It can charge, transfer data

and power an external display, all in one.



The USB Type-C port had a bit of a coming-out party this week, since it's also

featured on the new MacBook that Apple announced -- a machine so tiny it has

room for only one port and a headphone jack.



Unlike Apple, Google put two USB Type-C ports on the Pixel, one on either side.

That lets you charge the device from either side, which is nice when you're

traveling and don't know where the power outlet will be. But it also lets you

attach external devices and charge at the same time.



The new connection standard is interesting all on its own. Google says it

supports fast charging, so the Pixel can gain two hours of juice from being

plugged in for just 15 minutes. USB Type-C plugs are reversible, so you can't

insert them the wrong way, which means they last longer than previous

connectors, which tend to get damaged from repeatedly being shoved in the wrong

way. And the new USB connector has higher power capacity than

previous-generation USB connectors, so it can be used to charge devices big and

small.



That means that if, as Apple, Google and many other companies are hoping, USB

Type-C eventually becomes standard across the industry, you could use the same

charger to power any phone, any tablet and even any laptop. That would be a huge

improvement. While most non-Apple phones use standard micro-USB cables to

charge, laptop chargers come in every shape, size and expensive-to-replace

variation.



So at the end of the day, Google doesn't really care if you buy a Pixel. (Let's

be honest, it's doing fine without a marginal number of laptop sales thrown on

the pile.) A few die-hard Chrome fans will get it, and it will be a great

executive giveaway.



If you are looking for a minimalist laptop that requires an odd little

collection of adapters and dongles, the new MacBook is a heck of a lot lighter

and, hey, it comes in gold.



But as a technology platform and a demonstration of tech we might all be using

in the somewhat near future, the Pixel impresses. Now, where did I put that

chamois?
