sake of Google Assistant!

Google Assistant has become quite popular ever since it was unveiled recently
along with a Pixel smartphone by the search engine giant. But, laying hands on
the Pixel smartphone is still a dream for many, all thanks to its price tag.

However, you can definitely get Google Assistant to almost any smartphone that
runs on Nougat. If not Nougat, then you may have to install it. And, the second
important point is that you will need root access.

Having said this, we still do not know if this might actually work with your
specific smartphone or not, and also we would like to warn you about the rooting
procedure, as if you are not confident enough, you might actually brick your
smartphone.

Once Nougat is installed, you will have to use a file explorer to find
build.prop under Root/System. Inside th file, you will have add or adjust these
two lines as given here.

ro.product.model=Pixel XL

ro.opa.eligible_device=true

After you have done the necessary changes, you will have to reboot your
smartphone and go to Settings and then Apps, and select Google and clear the
data and cache information.

Having done this, Google should reload with Assistant built in, in most of the
cases, and you can call up by long-pressing the home button.
