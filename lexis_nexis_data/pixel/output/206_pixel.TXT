

The first Google Pixel smartphones went on sale in London today - with
enthusiasts queuing from 6am to snap one up.

Shoppers and Google staff packed into a pop-up store inside Currys PC World in
Tottenham Court Road to try out the much-hyped handset.

Londoner Rabi Rafi, 19, was first in the queue after getting up at 5am to ensure
his place, saying he had "not been this excited in a while".

The Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phones to feature Google Assistant and
claim day-long battery life, plus a seven-hour charge after being plugged in for
just 15 minutes.
