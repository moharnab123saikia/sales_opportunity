After recently releasing their very-own line of smartphones, Google is rumoured
to be launching two Android 2.0 smartwatches early next year.

The rumour comes from serial tipster Evan Blass, who stated that the company is
set to unveil its smartwatches in Q1 2017. Codenamed Angelfish and Swordfish,
these two devices are expected to complement the newly launched Google Pixel and
Pixel XL smartphones.

According to previous leaks, Angelfish will be the larger variant, sporting a
premium design. It will be similar to the Moto 360 and LG's Urbane 2nd Edition
LTE. The design is said to have visible lugs, with a smooth housing shaped to
curve where the watch band meets the body. At over 14mm, it will have GPS, LTE,
and a heart-rate monitor as well.

Swordfish, on the other hand, is smaller and thinner than Angelfish with a body
diameter of 42mm and a thickness of just 10.6mm - 0.8mm. It will be available in
silver, titanium, and rose gold color variants. The watch will also support
Google's interchangeable mode watch bands. Both devices will have Google
assistant, the new Siri competitor, unveiled early this month.
