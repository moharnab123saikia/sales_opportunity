SAMSUNG'S flagship Galaxy Note 7, above, was permanently withdrawn from sale on

Tuesday - because handsets were catching fire.



Having hit shelves only weeks earlier, the mobile had initially been getting

rave reviews but the feature set wasn't meant to include it doubling up as a

room heater.



So if you were planning to upgrade to the phone, what are your options now? We

know all about the iPhone 7 and Samsung's other top phone, the Galaxy S7

released back in the spring, but there are others unveiled this autumn that are

worth a look.



Here's my take on the best Android alternatives released in the last few weeks,

so just as new as the Galaxy Note 7.



Sony Xperia XZ £539.99, Carphone Warehouse Technical stuff: 5.2in display, 1080

x 1920 pixels, 23MP rear camera, 13MP front camera, waterproof.



SONY'S latest is a real corker. Its camera outstrips Samsung - this one has a

23MP sensor, laser focus (don't be frightened, it just means it's very fast) and

predictive features to ensure the best shot.



Selfies look great thanks to a 13MP frontfacing camera. It's also waterproof,

like the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7. Sony's design is highly attractive, especially

in blue, and stands out from the crowd. You can even put it on its end, handy

for those selfies.



Pixel Phone by Google £599, Carphone Warehouse or from £50.99 a month on EE

Technical stuff: 5in display, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 12MP rear camera, 8MP front

camera. GOOGLE'S own handset, out in the next few days, has a lot to offer.



It's a sleek, beautiful gadget with a fast camera, helped along by software that

reacts fast in low light for better shots.



It also has a clever extra: Google Assistant, a voice-activated virtual personal

assistant. And it comes with unlimited free Cloud storage for photos and videos.



Honor 8 £339.99, www.Three.co.uk Technical stuff: 5.2in display, 1080 x 1920

pixels, 12MP rear camera, 8MP front camera.



THIS is another smashing, good-value phone with some tech spec beating the

iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S7, but for a lower price.



The rear dual-sensor 12MP camera sits neatly in the shell and produces sharp

shots but struggles to retain the quality in lower light.



Like the Pixel and Huawei models, the fingerprint sensor is on the back and

takes a bit of getting used to.



Sony Xperia X Compact £369.99 from O2 Technical stuff: 4.6in display, 720 x 1280

pixels, 23MP rear camera, 5MP front camera.



IF you don't want a big-screen mobile, this phone offers many of the features of

the XZ but with a more manageable 4.6in display.



Its camera has the same high resolution as the bigger phone, with the

laserassisted auto-focus thrown in as well, but the front camera is the

lowest-res in the X-series line-up. It's not waterproof either.



The X Compact has a decent battery that lasts a full day easily.



Huawei Nova/Nova Plus £320/£429 out soon Technical stuff: Nova: 5in display,

1080 x 1920 pixels, 12MP rear camera, 8MP front camera. Nova Plus: 5.5in

display, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 16MP rear camera, 8MP front camera. THESE two

classy-looking phones from Huawei offer strong value and cuttingedge features

such as fingerprint sensor. The smaller phone's 12MP camera is good, but the

larger one has a 16MP version.



Both offer fast battery charging so if you run low on juice it won't take long

to be up and running again.



Alcatel Pixi 4 (5) £79.99 or £6 a month on contract, Carphone Warehouse

Technical stuff: 5in display, 480 x 854 pixels, 8MP rear camera, 5MP front

camera.



THIS is a great-value phone, especially from Carphone Warehouse.



The brackets at the end of the name indicate the screen size - 4in, 6in and 7in

display models are also available.



Resolution here is lower than rivals but it's still bright and attractive.



It has exclusive Polaroid filters for photos, while the front camera, unusually,

has a flash so selfies in low light are doable.
