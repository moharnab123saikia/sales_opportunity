According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "An

example method and system for blending textures of a composite image formed by a

plurality of source images mapped onto a three dimensional model are presented.

The composite image is projected to obtain an unblended projected image having

textures. The textures are blended to obtain a blended projected image. Both the

unblended and the blended projected images are backprojected onto the three

dimensional model. A difference is determined between a pixel of the

backprojected, blended image and a corresponding pixel of the backprojected,

unblended image. The determined difference is then applied to a further

corresponding pixel of the composite image to obtain a modified composite image

representing a blending of the plurality of source images in the composite

image."
