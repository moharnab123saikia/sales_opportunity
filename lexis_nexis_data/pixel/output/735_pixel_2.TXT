

The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 has blown up for good - and Apple and Google are
picking through the wreckage.

Shares of Apple edged higher Tuesday as analysts predicted the iPhone 7 will be
the big beneficiary of Samsung permanently pulling the plug on its troubled Note
7 smartphone.

Likewise, experts said Google's new Pixel phone, priced from $650, could get a
boost from Samsung's woes - although it's tethered to Verizon's network.

"Among the Android alternatives, the Pixel has to be at least worth
considering," said Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research.

Samsung shares tumbled 8 percent - their biggest one-day slide in eight years -
erasing $17 billion of the South Korean tech giant's market capitalization.

Analysts expect it to lose billions on the giant tech fiasco. After customers
discovered their brand new Note 7's could catch fire, Samsung issued a recall
and redesigned it - only to discover the replacement was also prone to catching
fire.

On Tuesday, Samsung threw in the towel and stopped making the Note 7. Customers
were told to power them down.

Evidence of the iPhone 7's momentum against the damaged Samsung was clear last
month, according to Slice Intelligence, a research firm that tracks online
sales.

In September, Apple's smartphone market share of online sales, thanks to the
recently released iPhone 7 and Samsung's Note 7 problems, leaped to 92.3 percent
- versus 4.2 percent for Samsung, according to Slice.

A month earlier, Apple's market share advantage was 42.2 percent to 33 percent.

Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said Samsung's woes could help Apple sell an
additional 8 million iPhones by Dec. 31.

The market's original expectations for Samsung, White said, were that the
company would sell 10 million to 14 million Galaxy Note 7's by the end of this
year - a number now dropping to zero.
