will reportedly be priced at Rs 20,000 - Rs 25,000, said the report. According

to the report, a senior executive confirmed the information.



The executive though did not specify whether the pricing was for the 16 GB or

the 32 GB variant of the device. The report though mentioned that the device

Gizbot's source reportedly said, "Asus Nexus 7 (2013) will be sold by physical

channels (Asus owned shops and other retail chains) as well as online route (

be taken by Google, the report said.
