According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Methods and systems for rolling shutter removal are described. A computing
device may be configured to determine, in a frame of a video, distinguishable
features. The frame may include sets of pixels captured asynchronously. The
computing device may be configured to determine for a pixel representing a
feature in the frame, a corresponding pixel representing the feature in a
consecutive frame; and determine, for a set of pixels including the pixel in the
frame, a projective transform that may represent motion of the camera. The
computing device may be configured to determine, for the set of pixels in the
frame, a mixture transform based on a combination of the projective transform
and respective projective transforms determined for other sets of pixels.
Accordingly, the computing device may be configured to estimate a motion path of
the camera to account for distortion associated with the asynchronous capturing
of the sets of pixels."

The patent was filed on September 12, 2012 Application no. 13/611,023
