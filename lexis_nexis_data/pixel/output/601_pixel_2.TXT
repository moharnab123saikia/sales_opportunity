SAN FRANCISCO



Google fired back at Apple with a pair of new smartphones, a "convertible"

tablet and other gadgetry ahead of the year-end holiday shopping season.



The California tech giant unveiled on Tuesday two new Nexus smartphones with

enhanced features including fingerprint sensors and improved cameras aimed at

the high end of the market dominated by Apple and Samsung.



The launch of the phones, the Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5X,comes a day after Apple

reported record first-weekend sales of its new iPhones.



Nexus devices, which typically do not sell as much as iPhones or iPads, are a

way for the tech giant to showcase its latest advancements in mobile hardware

and software.



Google said it was partnering with South Korea's LG for its 13.20-centimetre

screen Nexus 5X, and with China's Huawei for its "phablet" sized

14.47-centimetre Nexus 6P.



Both handsets will be sold unlocked, with Google hoping to capitalise on a trend

in the US and other markets away from smartphone subsidies as part of long-term

contracts.



"We care about making sure there are affordable, high quality smartphones for

users around the world," said Sundar Pichai, the Google product chief who is

slated to head the company's largest unit under a reorganisation announced

earlier this year.



The phones, which aim to showcase the Google Android operating system, were

available for ordering in the United States, Britain, Japan and Ireland, with

more countries to be added next week, Google said as it unveiled the phones at a

San Francisco media event.



The Android mobile platform is a key element in Google's strategy to maintain

revenue from online advertising as people switch from Web browser searches to

smartphone apps.



The Nexus 5X starts at $379 (Bt13,780) for US customers and the 6P starts at

$499.



The devices will feature the new Android operating system known as Marshmallow,

which allows for fingerprint sensors for unlocking and other features including

Android Pay.



The fingerprint sensors will help quickly authorise purchases made through

Android Pay, the one-touch payment app on Android devices that competes with

Apple Pay.



The phones are priced below the premium devices from Apple such as the new

iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, and similar offerings from Samsung.



With the Nexus-branded devices, Google is able to control much of the hardware

and software in a manner similar to Apple, which has its own operating system.



"We try to push the next generation of computing forward; to do that we build

hardware," Pichai said of Google making its own branded devices.



Google makes Android mobile software available free to device makers, but makes

its Nexus line to showcase capabilities of the operating system. The Pixel C is

the first tablet built ground-up by Google and is seen as an alternative to the

iPad Pro unveiled this month and Microsoft's Surface.



The "C" in the name stands for "convertible" because it features an optional

keyboard that doubles as a cover and connects magnetically for laptop-computer

style use.



"We think the Pixel C tablet and keyboard experience really unlocks ways to play

and be productive across one device," Google's Andrew Bowers said while showing

off the new hardware.



Pixel C tablet will be available in time for the year-end holidays at a starting

price of $499, with the keyboard priced at $149, Google said.



Google unveiled an upgraded version of its popular Chromecast device that plugs

into television screens to stream content wirelessly from the Internet, with

smartphones or tablets serving as controls.



The company also introduced Chromecast Audio, a pendant sized device designed to

plug into stereo speakers for streaming music, #124podcasts, YouTube or other

audio content through home sound systems.



"Now you have a simple way to amplify your experience to the biggest devices in

the home," said Rishi Chandra of the Chromecast team.



Chandra announced that the mobile app of music-streaming service Spotify will

work with Chromecast Audio, which avoids Bluetooth connectivity hiccups.



Chromecast Audio promised to provide a low-cost way for people to outfit homes

with Internet "smart" stereo systems, according to Gartner analyst Brian Blau.



"It is an interesting play on having your music anywhere you want," Blau said.



Both new Chromecast devices kept the $35 price of the earlier version.
