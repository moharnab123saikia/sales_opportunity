Google virtual reality headset is all set for a global release.



Announced a few weeks ago, Google's Daydream View VR headset is releasing

globally on 10th of November. It will be available via Google Store and at

retailers across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and

Australia. The Daydream View is priced at $79, which roughly translates to Rs

5000.



Showcased alongside the Pixel smartphones, Google's VR (Virtual Reality) headset

is made of lightweight fabric to provide you comfort in long VR sessions.

Currently, the new Pixel phones are compatible with the Daydream View. However,

you can expect expect the search-giant to soon release a detailed list of

handsets that play nice with its VR headset. What separates it from most Android

VR products is its wireless controller. Apart from basic navigation controls, it

also comes with motion sensor that can be used for gaming. For instance,

third-party developers can implement it in games such as tennis and golf.



The VR boasts of companion apps such as the YouTube VR. It features a library of

YouTube videos meant specifically for the virtual reality experience. Another

interesting app Street View, will let you visit over 70 countries and experience

150 tours of the world's popular places. To keep the action junkies busy, the

Daydream VR will offer explosive games such as the Gunjack 2: End of Shift.
