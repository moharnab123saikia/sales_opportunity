The Play Tab is poised to compete with the Google Nexus 7.



Tuesday, October 15, 2013: Xolo added to its tablet portfolio today with the

all-new Xolo Play Tab 7.0. The Indian smartphone maker has reportedly done quite

well in the country and has introduced an array of smartphones and tablets. The

Play Tab 7.0 is priced at Rs 12,999 and is available at retailers all over

India.



The Xolo Play Tab 7.0 is powered by the Nvidia Tegra 3 quad core processor and

sports a 17.7-cm (7-inch) display, which offers a 1,280 x 800 pixel resolution.

It has a 2 mega pixel front camera and a 4,000 mAh battery. Further, the device

has 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage. Unfortunately though, it has

neither voice calling nor 3G connectivity support. It runs the Android 4.1 Jelly

Bean operating system.



"As Xolo continues to deliver on its promise to bring differentiated technology

to discerning consumers, we're replicating the success we've achieved in the

smartphone category now in tablets. Xolo Play Tab 7.0 marks the first tablet in

the Xolo Play category of products, powered by NVIDIA Tegra. Similar to Xolo

Play T1000 smartphone launched in July, the Tab delivers similar entertainment

now on a bigger 7-inch screen," AndroidOS quoted Sunil Raina, business head at

XOLO as saying.



The Xolo Play Tab is a competitor to the Google Nexus 7 (2012), which is going

to be a tough one to beat for the domestic smart device maker. Moreover, the

Nexus 7 is available at a mere Rs 9,999 on Flipkart for its 16 GB version.
