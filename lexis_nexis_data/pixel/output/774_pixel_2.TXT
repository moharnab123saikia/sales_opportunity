Thursday, November 28, 2013: Black Friday is approaching and so is Cyber Monday
(2 December). Google owned makers of the Moto X smartphone, Motorola, has
reportedly announced that it will make the device available for just $349 of
contract for the 16 GB variant. The 32 GB variant, on the other hand, will be
available for $400. According to reports, the customisable device and even its
Moto Maker and the Developer Edition will be available to consumers at a
discount of $150 for Cyber Monday.

In a post on Google+, Motorola wrote, "Thinking about Cyber Monday already?
We'll be offering a $150 discount on any off-contract Moto X, including Moto
Maker and Dev Edition. Supplies will be limited." With limited supplies though,
consumers would have to make a real rush in order to purchase the device on this
special one time only occasion.

If you need a reminder for the specifications of the Moto X smartphone, it has a
11.9-cm (4.7-inch) AMOLED 720 pixel display and runs the Android 4.2.2 Jelly
Bean operating system out of the box. An update to the Android 4.4 KitKat OS has
been started already though. The device is powered by a 2,200 mAh battery and
has a 10 mega pixel rear camera along with a 2 mega pixel front camera. It is
powered by the Motorola X8 processor and has 2 GB of RAM.
