XL, as well as a 4K Chromecast, Google Home, and its Daydream VR device during a
special presentation in early October, according to an insider report.

Citing a reliable, unnamed source, Android Police dates the Pixel, a 5 inch
quad-core handset, and the larger and more powerful 5.5in quad-core Pixel XL,
for an October 4 reveal.

The smartphone date was first suggested by Droid Life at the start of August but
the presentation is now understood to provide a wider platform for new Google
products.

Also set for the event are Google Home, a voice-controlled smart home assistant
which debuted at Google I/O in May, a Chromecast media streaming device that
will support 4K ultra HD resolution, and a personal viewer device for its
Daydream VR program (also announced at Google I/O.)

Launch dates and prices for the Pixel phones as well as a location for the
October 4 event are not known.
