Tech giant Google is preparing to announce two new phones, the Pixel and Pixel

XL, as well as a 4K Chromecast, Google Home, and its Daydream VR device during a

special presentation in early October, according to an insider report.



Citing a reliable, unnamed source, Android Police dates the Pixel, a 5 inch

quad-core handset, and the larger and more powerful 5.5in quad-core Pixel XL,

for an October 4 reveal.



The smartphone date was first suggested by Droid Life at the start of August but

the presentation is now understood to provide a wider platform for new Google

products.



Also set for the event are Google Home, a voice-controlled smart home assistant

which debuted at Google I/O in May, a Chromecast media streaming device that

will support 4K ultra HD resolution, and a personal viewer device for its

Daydream VR program (also announced at Google I/O.)



Launch dates and prices for the Pixel phones as well as a location for the

October 4 event are not known.
