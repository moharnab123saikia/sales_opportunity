As the countdown to the official unveiling of Google's new flagship Android

phones ticks by, new data have emerged regarding recent benchmarks of the

supposed Google Pixel XL.



A Geekbench listing has surfaced where a 'Google Marin' handset, Google's

codename for the Pixel XL, was recently benchmarked and shown to be running a

Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM, reports TechRadar.



While 4GB of RAM is fairly standard for flagship devices, it's surprising that

the Pixel XL may not be equipped with the newer Snapdragon 821, which is 10%

faster than the 820.



The Pixel XL will be made by an HTC design team and is expected to have an

aluminum unibody design with a 5.5-inch screen. It is also rumored to have a

rear-facing fingerprint scanner.



The new Google Pixel phones will be replacing the old Nexus line and will be the

first smartphones to officially bear the Google name.
