According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "The
invention relates to a method, device and computer-program product for detection
of undesired temporal variations (flicker) in a sequence of video frames. In one
embodiment, frame-wise luminance means are compared with a reference level and
the crossing frequency is compared with expected variation frequencies, such as
frequencies associated with an illumination frequency through aliasing. The
crossings count can be refined by introducing a latency zone around the
reference level. In case of a positive detection of an undesired temporal
variation, there is further provided a correction method, device and
computer-program product using cumulated distribution functions. The visual
detriment of flicker-induced saturation of pixels is alleviated either by
brightening non-saturated pixels or by replacing the saturated pixels by
randomly sampled values in accordance with a reference cumulated distribution
function. The invention provides embodiments suitable for real-time processing
of streamed video sequences."

The patent was filed on February 6, 2010 Application no. 13/521,144
