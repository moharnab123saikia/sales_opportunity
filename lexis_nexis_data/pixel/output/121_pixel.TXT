Review: Google Pixel laptop impresses

CHARLOTTE, N.C. * There's a lot to love about Google's new high-end Chromebook

Pixel laptop: a vivid, high-resolution touch screen, powerful speakers and

next-generation USB ports meant to standardize power chargers. All for $300

cheaper than the original model.



But the Pixel's limitations became clear during a cross-country flight. Machines

running Google's Chrome operating system are meant primarily for online use.

Although the Pixel promises offline access to files stored on Google's online

Drive service, it was hit or miss with files that weren't in Google's own

formats. Fortunately, I had my Mac laptop to turn to.



The Pixel goes on sale Wednesday for $999, while $1,299 gets you a version with

more storage and a faster processor.



Chromebook basics



On machines running Chrome just about everything works through the web browser.

Many apps, in fact, are simply bookmarks to a service's regular website.



Google figures you'll store most of your files in the cloud, so Chromebooks have

limited storage. The basic Pixel has just 32 gigabytes, compared with the

minimum 128 gigabytes on a MacBook Air. The pricier Pixel has 64 gigabytes.



Using it without Internet access



Some apps do have limited offline capabilities, and they have improved since I

tested the original Pixel in 2013. Some of these functions are now automatically

enabled, and the Pixel stores your most recently opened files automatically for

offline use.



But that doesn't apply to files you merely copied to Google Drive, as I learned

the hard way. All Google-format files are stored automatically, but what I

needed were Word and PDF documents. Next time, I'll need to open or download

those files individually ahead of time. I couldn't find a way to enable entire

folders at once.



As an online device



Chromebooks are typically budget devices costing a few hundred dollars. The

Pixel is the exception, with premium performance and a premium price tag.



Still, the Pixel offers a 13-inch touch screen and sharp display at 239 pixels

per inch for less than $1,000. Windows laptops with that performance typically

cost a few hundred dollars more. Apple doesn't make touch-screen laptops at all.

(That said, comparable Windows and Mac laptops have more storage for the money.

And many are lighter than the Pixel's 3.3 pounds.)



The slower model I tested was speedy - more than adequate for Web surfing, text

documents and even video. Sound came through nice and clear. Google promises up

to 12 hours of use on a single battery charge. With the battery nearly drained,

I got a 50 per cent charge in about a half-hour - enough for a day of meetings

Tuesday in Silicon Valley.



Power potential



What I like most is the Pixel's use of the emerging Type-C standard for USB. In

English, that means faster and more flexible charging. Android phones have long

used USB for charging, but the current USB technology limits how much power the

phone can draw. That's one reason laptops, with greater power needs, come with

their own chargers.



Type-C is meant to standardize those chargers, so you might one day need just

one for all your phones, tablets and laptops. Type-C draws more power and

transfers data faster than current USB.



You might have heard of Type-C when Apple announced a new MacBook on Monday.

Apple ditched regular USB ports in favour of USB-C, but in addition to Type-C,

the Pixel has two regular ports and an SD slot for camera memory.



With Type-C, cords can be inserted in either direction, much like the iPhone's

Lightning connector, so you don't have to figure out which side is up. The Pixel

goes further in having ports on both sides, so you're not left with tangled

cords if the outlet is on the wrong side.



The port also works for display output, though you'll need a $40 adapter until

TVs and monitors start getting Type-C. I watched The Simpsons on my TV that way.



Apps



Google gives Android developers an easy way to make their apps also work on

Chrome. Google says about 30 apps have been converted, including the

video-sharing app Vine.



Microsoft's Office isn't one of them, but Google does make it easy to work with

Office files. They open in a web browser just like Google-format files and get

saved automatically in the Microsoft formats for sharing.



The Pixel is impressive, but consider your needs away from Wi-Fi. Many other

laptops, including the new MacBook, offer more flexibility for a few hundred

dollars more. !@COPYRIGHT=Â© 2015 Telegraph-Journal (New Brunswick)
