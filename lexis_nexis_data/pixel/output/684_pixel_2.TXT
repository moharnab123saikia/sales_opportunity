BEST FOR VALUE



Toshiba Chromebook 2 CB30-B-104 £270



Squint and you might mistake this laptop for a MacBook Air: the off-white

plastic body looks remarkably like brushed aluminium. The Toshiba is a

handsomelooking Chromebook, the 1.35kg chassis is sturdy and Toshiba has

squeezed in all the essentials: the keyboard feels crisp and responsive and the

large, buttonless trackpad works well too. Inside is a 16GB solid-state drive

(SSD) and an Intel Celeron processor with a generous 4GB of Ram, so performance

is sprightly. There is a cheaper B-103 model (£190) but our choice would be this

version with a 1080p 13.3in screen: it delivers pin-sharp images with great

viewing angles and is on a par with those of PCs costing twice as much. The

laptop also supports the latest wi-fi and has a fast USB 3.0 port, an SD card

reader and seven hours of battery life. Verdict Good looks and performance, and

a gorgeous screen.

BEST FOR STUDENTS



Dell Chromebook 11 £214



Cast in dull grey and black, Dell's Chromebook 11 is no looker. But what it

lacks in allure it makes up in practicality: the tough, 1.2kg body is bolstered

with rubber edges, making it robust enough for a tough working life. The spec is

also up to scratch: speedy wi-fi capability; an SD card reader to supplement the

16GB of storage; and an easy-to-use keyboard, even if the buttonless trackpad is

a little fiddly. The Dell delivers 7½ hours of battery life, but the 11.6in

display is disappointing - images wash out when you tilt it back. Forgive that

flaw, though, and there's much to love.



Verdict Tough, practical and portable. The display is a letdown, though.

BEST FOR SHOWING OFF



Chromebook Pixel £799



Google's own version of a Chromebook is designed to show off just what the

system can do. None of the plastics used by rivals here: the 1.5kg Pixel is a

metal machine and is peppered with high-end hardware and nifty features. Tap the

lid twice and multicoloured LEDs glow to indicate the remaining battery power,

the superb keyboard has touch-activated backlighting and the glass trackpad is

the best on test. This standard model has a powerful Intel Core i5 processor,

8GB of Ram and a 32GB SSD; a £999 model ups the ante with a Core i7 chip, 16GB

of Ram and a 64GB SSD. Whichever you choose, the Pixel's 12.9in touchscreen is

the match of any on the market: it's bright, and colours are accurate. With 11

hours of battery life and the graphical grunt to show 4K on a compatible TV or

monitor, the Pixel is the ultimate in Chromebook oneupmanship. But the price is

a big turn-off. Verdict Stunning design and an amazing display - at a price.

BEST FOR CONNECTIONS



HP Chromebook 14 £249



While others in this line-up settle for a monochromatic look, HP's device wraps

an attention-seeking turquoise or green band around the base and lid, and the

keyboard is surrounded by metallic silver. The 14in display brings a weight

penalty - the HP is an unwieldy 1.7kg - but the spacious keyboard layout and big

trackpad are a pleasure to work on. The big difference, however, is the hardware

inside. HP has opted for Nvidia's Tegra K1 processor, and that's no bad thing:

battery life approaches the nine-hour mark, performance is nippy and, like the

Toshiba, it needs no fan, so it's silent. You can also use the HP outside wi-fi

networks: builtin mobile broadband via a pre-installed Sim is good for 250MB a

month for two years, with a 500MB add-on at £6 a month.



Verdict Built-in 3G makes for an always-connected laptop.

BEST FOR BUSINESS



Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 11e Chromebook £330



Lenovo's ThinkPads are popular with business people because of their bulletproof

build. The "Yoga" label refers to the machine's flexibility: the 11.6in

touchscreen folds back through 360 degrees, allowing the Lenovo to transform

from laptop to tablet, or you can make it into a tent shape for watching movies,

say. The quadcore processor powers past most of its rivals, the touchscreen

delivers cracking images and the keyboard is excellent. Unusually, the latest

wi-fi compatibility is accompanied by an old-school Ethernet socket.



Verdict A little pricier than most, but you get what you pay for.
