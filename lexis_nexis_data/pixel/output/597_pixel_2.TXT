Google Nexus 10, LG Nexus 4 and a 32GB version of the Google Nexus 7.

Industry sources said that Google have been circulating a video recorded at one
of their weekly events which details all the devices.

The Google Nexus 10, which is a true rival to Apple's 9.7-inch iPad will be made
by Samsung and have a quad-core processor.

It is expected to run at a resolution of 2560Ãƒ-1600, giving it a 16:10 aspect
ratio and 300 pixels per inch (PPI) . That is far above the iPad's 264 PPI and
will offer truly stunning clarity and multimedia playback.

iPad 3 has a screen resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels.

The tablet is rumoured to launch on Android 4.2, which is a new version of
Android although it'll still  be referred to as Jelly Bean . The Nexus 10 is
likely to support 3G, unlike the Nexus 7 which only had WiFi.
