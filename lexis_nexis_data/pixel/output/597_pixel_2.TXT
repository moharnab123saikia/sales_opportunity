Google is expected to hold a big event in New York on October 29 to unveil the

Google Nexus 10, LG Nexus 4 and a 32GB version of the Google Nexus 7.



Industry sources said that Google have been circulating a video recorded at one

of their weekly events which details all the devices.



The Google Nexus 10, which is a true rival to Apple's 9.7-inch iPad will be made

by Samsung and have a quad-core processor.



It is expected to run at a resolution of 2560Ã-1600, giving it a 16:10 aspect

ratio and 300 pixels per inch (PPI) . That is far above the iPad's 264 PPI and

will offer truly stunning clarity and multimedia playback.



iPad 3 has a screen resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels.



The tablet is rumoured to launch on Android 4.2, which is a new version of

Android although it'll still  be referred to as Jelly Bean . The Nexus 10 is

likely to support 3G, unlike the Nexus 7 which only had WiFi.
