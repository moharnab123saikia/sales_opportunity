United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patent no. 8,953,877, on

February 10, 2015, to Google Inc (California), titled as "Noise estimation for

images"



Inventors:  Babacan; Sevket Derin (San Francisco, CA)

Assignee:  Google Inc. (Mountain View, CA)



According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Implementations relate to estimating noise in images. In some implementations,

a method includes extracting a plurality of sample blocks of pixels from a

received image, where each sample block includes a subset of pixels of the

image. One or more of the sample blocks are examined for texture content based

on whether the sample blocks include one or more edges based on a predetermined

threshold. At least one sample block determined to include texture content is

removed. The method determines one or more average color variances based on the

remaining sample blocks that have not been removed, where noise estimations for

the image are based on the average color variances."



The patent was filed on May 14, 2013 Application no. 13/894,364
