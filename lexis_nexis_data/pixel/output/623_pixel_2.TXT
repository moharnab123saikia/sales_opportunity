KARACHI, Aug. 3 -- Archos has been making several budget products since quite a
time now and the 97 Carbon is no exception, which is priced at $250 at the time
of announcement.

As evident by the name, 97 Carbon has got a 9.7 inch touchscreen with a
resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels.

Here are the rest of the specs:

9.7 inch IPS technology display with a resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels

1.1 cm thick aluminium body

Weight: 618 grams

Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich

1Ghz single-core ARM Cortex A8 processor with 1Gb RAM

16 Gb internal storage with a microSD card slot

Front and rear facing cameras

USB/HDMI ports

Access to Google Play Store

The tablet also comes pre-loaded with Microsoft's Office Suite Viewer for
viewing MS Office files. At 97 Carbon Tablet's announcement the Archos CEO said:

"We wanted to introduce a new series that not only combines affordability with a
new slim design, but features the best that Google has to offer. With the
Elements series we have done just that. It's the perfect balance of hardware,
software optimization and content through the Google Play ecosystem."

Archos' 97 Carbon competes with the Google Nexus 7 tablet which comes at the
same $250 price tag for the 16Gb flavor while the 8Gb model can be found for as
low as $200.

The Archos tablet's biggest advantage against the Nexus 7 is it's considerably
larger 9.7 inch screen which puts it in the same 10 inch league as the 'premium'
Ipad.

It will become an even better deal than it already is if Archos manages to
update it to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean quickly and the $250 price tag will be
justified even further.

Here's the spec comparison between the Archos 97 Carbon and the Google Nexus 7:

The Archos 97 Carbon did managed to beat Nexus 7 in several categories but it
disappoints in the CPU department thanks to its paltry single-core 1Ghz
processor. Still, both of them are quite good tablets especially if we consider
their prices and their features.

We are anticipating that online stores in Pakistan are likely to enlist 97
Carbon tablet on their charts soon Published by HT Syndication with permission
