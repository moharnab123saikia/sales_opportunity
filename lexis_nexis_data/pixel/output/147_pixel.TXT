The Google Pixel is now available for pre-order in the UK. The new phone by

Google has been billed as the first phone entirely made by Google - 'inside and

out'.



And the company is hoping it will be a direct competitor to Apple's iPhone.



Also unveiled at the event were Google Wifi, an update to Chromecast and lastly

Google Home got an official price and ship date.



All quite exciting, so if you want the Google Pixel, here's what you need to

know.



Pre-orders began in the UK yesterday and will ship to stores on Thursday,

October 20. Better yet, if you pre-order before October 20 you'll receive a £50

Google Play voucher.



Head to either Carphone Warehouse , Google or EE to place your pre-order.

If you buy directly from Google or from the Carphone Warehouse (in store or

online) you can pick up the phones SIM-free and unlocked for the one-off price

of £599 for the 5-inch Pixel and £719 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL.



Right now, it's looking like EE is the only network offering them on contract in

an exclusive deal.
