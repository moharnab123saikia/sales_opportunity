Google takes on cellphone giants

SAN FRANCISCO: Google yesterday announced a new "Pixel" smartphone and a suite

of consumer electronics products for the home, planting itself firmly in the

hardware business and challenging Apple's iPhone at the high end of the $400

billion (R5.5 trillion) global smartphone market.



The string of announcements - including the $649 Pixel, a smart speaker for the

living room dubbed "Home", a virtual reality headset, and a new Wi-Fi router -

is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete head-to-head with Apple,

Amazon and even manufacturers of cellphones, using its own Android operating

system.



Echoing Apple's long-standing philosophy, Google said it was striving for the

tighter integration of hardware and software.



"The thinking is that if we can work on hardware and software together, we can

innovate much better," said hardware chief Rick Osterloh, citing a recent

reorganisation drive uniting once-disparate hardware teams.



Under the new structure, the company has begun to take a much more integrated

approach to things like supply chain management and design, added Mario Queiroz,

a vice-president of product management.



"The learnings from one product are benefiting another product," he said. Unlike

earlier Google phone efforts under the Nexus brand, the Pixel devices are

designed and developed by Google from the start, although Taiwan'sâ[#x20ac]¨HTC

Corp will serve as the contract manufacturer.



Taking another page from the Apple playbook, Google said it would work

exclusively with a single carrier in the US, Verizon Communications, on the

Pixel, emulating Apple's agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T.



That deal gave Apple unprecedented control over the look of the phone and how it

worked. Shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, closed up 0.3 percent,

while Verizon fell 1.2 percent after the announcement.



With a higher Quad HD resolution, compared to 1080p on the smaller version, the

Pixel's high-end camera is a distinguishing feature of the phone, which will be

able to receive a seven-hour charge in 15 minutes.- Reuters
