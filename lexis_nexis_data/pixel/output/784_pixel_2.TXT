into tourist cruisers on the Thames.

Experts even say it could let you see if the hotel you're about to book really
is a stone's throw from the beach.

These are some of the stunning images on Google's new mapping site, which claims
to be able to show the entire world in unprecedented detail.

The pictures, taken from a spacecraft 450km above the earth and planes flying at
low altitude over major cities, are the most detailed ever put on the internet.

"Areas are covered at different resolutions," said a Google spokesperson.

"The resolution varies from 1km per pixel, where a single pixel in the image
covers an area of 1km, to 6 inches per pixel. At the lowest resolution, large
geographic features such as mountains and lakes are visible, and at the highest
resolution, detailed features of the earth such as buildings and cars are
visible."

Visitors to the site at maps.google.co.uk can enter a postcode, or simply type
the name of the landmark they want.

The system can even superimpose street names onto the satellite image, and show
a detailed route map using satellite photos to show exactly where you need to
go.

Pictures are retaken every 18 months to keep the system up to date.

Experts say the images could even lead to new way to plan holidays.

Several travel web sites are working on including the satellite images into
their web sites, so holidaymakers can click to see if their hotel really is a
stone's throw from the beach.
