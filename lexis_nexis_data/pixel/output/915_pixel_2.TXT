A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team



Why Google Glass is fascinating; Chromebook Pixel just puzzling && Chicago

Sun-Times



Andy Ihnatko:



This was a good week for the Glass project. I still don't know that Google has a

viable product on their hands. But it's certainly no longer a pie-in-the-sky

concept. The mockery that Glass received from some commentators during its first

announcement in April of last year might have been understandable...but now it

seems embarrassingly premature.



Google had something else to talk about last week, though. I can't remember a

product that's baffled me harder or more roughly than Google's new Chromebook

Pixel...



I talked to Google about the Pixel on launch day, asking some of the dumbest and

most basic questions I've ever dared ask, but I'm still profoundly confused.

Today, the Pixel seems to be serving a customer who doesn't exist. Even a power

Chromebook user, I reckon, would be more likely to buy a $1300 Windows notebook

and simply run webapps in the Chrome browser, right?



No, the new iOS 6.1 lock screen bypass bug does not allow access to your

iPhone's file system && The Next Web



Matt Panzarino:



Earlier today, word began getting around that there was a new way to bypass the

iOS 6.1 lock screen and that this one was even worse, allowing full access to

the user portion of the file system. Well, that's not exactly true, as we've

uncovered with some simple tests.



The lock screen bug does in fact exist, and it works as advertised, bypassing

the lock and bringing you to a blank black screen with just the status bar. But

it allows you no access to anything, not pictures, not contacts and certainly

not the file system.



Two ways to bypass the lock screen?



The iTunes Value Structure && asymco



Note 2: My estimate for the iTunes Music payments to publishers is equivalent to

about 60% of total [recorded] industry revenues.



BlackBerry threat? Pentagon to open networks to Apple, Google && Financial Post



The Pentagon said it wants employees to have the flexibility to use commercial

products on classified and unclassified networks. It plans to create a military

mobile applications store and hire a contractor to build a system that may

eventually handle as many as 8m devices.



"This is not simply about embracing the newest technology -- it is about keeping

the department's workforce relevant in an era when information accessibility and

cybersecurity play a critical role in mission success," Teri Takai, the

department's chief information officer, said in a statement.



BlackBerry shares fell. (Thanks @modelportfolio2003 for the link.)



Science and gun violence: why is the research so weak? && Boing Boing



Meanwhile, outside the filter bubble...



Gun violence research suffers from a lack of consistently recorded data and, for

that matter, a lack of data, in general. As John Pepper, associate economics

professor at The University of Virginia and the study director on the 2004

report, put it, "The data are just terrible."



Worse, critics say the methods used to analyze that data are also deeply flawed

in many cases. What you end up with, researchers told me, is a field where key

pieces of the puzzle are missing entirely and where multiple scientists are

reaching wildly different conclusions from the exact same data sets. For

instance, because of those differences in the definition of "defensive gun use"

some researchers will tell you that Americans use a gun to defend themselves

something like 1.5 million times every year. Others say it happens maybe 200,000

times annually.



Part one of a series. Read.



What has been the internal reaction at Yahoo to Marissa Mayer's no work from

home policy? && Quora



Based on this titanic list of three, possibly four, Yahoos, the answer is:

positive.



The CCIA and RIM tell the FTC banning injunctions for FRAND patents can make

smartphone wars worse && Groklaw



The FTC is now suggesting that companies that own standards-essential patents

and offer them under FRAND terms, like Motorola, should not be allowed to seek

injunctions regarding those kinds of patents except in the most extreme of

circumstances. But for decades, they had those property rights, the right to

seek injunctive relief. How can a government agency just show up and take those

traditional rights away by fiat, without reasonable compensation? That's not

America, to me. I don't even like software patents, but as long as the patent

system exists, you want it to be fair. And this just feels wrong.



This seems to be a case of Groklaw deciding which side it likes, and tailoring

its thinking to go along with it. The reason to oppose injunctions on

standards-essential patents (SEPs) - which Google (via Motorola) and Samsung own

lots of - is that it would allow the owners of those SEPs to shut rivals who

need to meet standards out of the marketplace, simply by withdrawing the rival's

permission to use those patents. Being part of a standard requires licensing to

all comers. (The idea that stopping injunctions over SEPs would make things

worse is obvious nonsense. Nor is the FTC saying that SEP injunctions aren't

ever allowed. )



Apple to FTC: Samsung and Google lose most of their cases over

declared-essential patents && FOSS Patents



Apple's letter raises the very important point (starting on pageÂ 6) that most

patents that are declared essential to a standard (by their holders, typically

without any independent verification of essentiality) actually aren't - and if

someone wants to get paid for an allegedly standard-essential patent, a

defendant must have the right to challenge the validity of the patent and its

essentiality in court without having to pay for a portfolio license based on an

arbitrated or court-determined value of an unverified portfolio. While the

proposed consent decree generally mentions that challenges to validity,

essentiality and infringement allegations don't make a company an unwilling

licensee, a very recent InterDigital filing in lawsuits targeting Huawei and ZTE

shows that some SEP owners nevertheless argue that they should receive royalties

even without having to prove that their asserted patents are valid and actually

used by an implementer of the standard in question.



Something of a new wrinkle that many of these claimed "standards-essential"

patents actually aren't. Shouldn't there be a clear register of such things? And

if not, why not?



On bias && Benedict Evans



Apple Maps is a fiasco, but it is fundamentally a secondary issue and there is

no evidence it affects sales. The same is true of skeumorphism, or 'openness' or

a dozen other issues that people talk about. What matters is the addressable

market. Criticisms of Apple product, by and large, do not matter so long as they

do not affect sales, and there is no evidence that they do, to any material

degree. Hence, they do not really interest me, regardless of whether I

personally agree with them, as a user of the product.



Android is different. Android does not really face an addressable market

question. 1.7bn phones will be sold this year, perhaps a little more, and half

will be smartphones, and almost all of those that are sold for less than $400

will run Android. In a couple of years, if nothing changes, Android will be

selling a billion units a year or more.



The important questions, therefore, are within Android: they are product

questions. Something like a third of unit sales are in China and have little

access to Google services. What does that mean? Another third to a half of units

are sold by Samsung, and all the other branded Android OEMs are struggling.

Android is fragmented, Android is very weak in apps for tablets, and so on, and

so on. What do all these variations mean? Android is many different things in a

way that the iPhone is not, and understanding those variations makes up the

analytical challenge.



The bias is a cognitive one, so most people aren't aware they suffer from it.
