Google to Launch Gem Smartwatch



LENGTH: 259  words





Google is all set to launch its smartwatch by the end of October along with the

release of its Android 4.4 Kit Kat.





According to TechRadar, Artem Russakovskii of Android Police wrote on his Google

+ profile: "feel relatively confident about but either don't have visual

evidence or a second confirmation, so I'm going to keep them to G+."

The features and specifications of the wearable device are, however, still under

wraps. If rumors are true, this smartwatch by Google will be the third entrant

in the league of wearable technology after Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch and

Sony Smartwatch Specs.

The Samsung Galaxy Gear Specs comes with a 1.63 inch display with 320 X 320

pixel resolution. It sports a stainless steel body and is available in multiple

strap color options.

The watch comes with a proprietary USB 3.0 charger and supported by 800MHz

Exynos single-core processor. It also features Bluetooth 4.0 LE along with 1.9

megapixel camera, 720p video recording and speaker + 2 mics.

The smartwatch is compatible with new Galaxy devices and previous gen Galaxy

support is expected to come soon. It comes with a price tag of $299.

The Sony Smartwatch Specs comes with a 1.6 inch display with 200 X 176 pixel

resolution. It sports an aluminum body and is available in multiple strap color

options. The device is well-suited with most Android phones and features a micro

USB charging.

The smartwatch, however, falls low when it comes to inbuilt features as it does

not support a camera or video recording. The device comes with a price tag of

USD 262.
