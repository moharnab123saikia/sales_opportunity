Being rough with the Sony Xperia Go is not an issue.

This Android smartphone is sufficiently protected against a watery death - it is
able to survive a swim in fresh water as long as it does not go deeper than 1m
for 30minutes. Dust is also unlikely to enter the phone if its ports are
properly sealed.

If you perspire a lot, have no fear. The 3.5-inch display is equipped with a
feature known as wet finger tracking, which lets you interact with the screen
even if your fingers are coated with sweat or water.

The disappointment here is a low screen resolution of 320 x 480 pixels, making
the phone less likely as an entertainment tool.

But if you can forgive its display density of 165pixels per inch, it still fares
pretty well when you need to read e-mail messages, browse the Web and watch some
low-resolution videos on YouTube.

A dual-core 1GHz processor powers this Android smartphone, so it has sufficient
juice to run apps without visible lag.

While it is preloaded with last year's Google Android 2.3 Gingerbread, the phone
is slated for an Android 4.0 update.

Samsung Galaxy Beam

With its 12.5mm thick profile, the Samsung Galaxy Beam feels like a clunky
phone. Good thing the army uniform has deep pockets.

You may even be able to carry along other accessories such as a battery pack or
mini-speaker.

Speaking of batteries, you get two 2,000mAh ones to power the device. They are
relatively slim, so you can slot a second one into a pocket and hook it up when
the first one dries up.

The device does not guzzle energy heavily, so you can probably stretch it for a
day if you go through your Facebook, Twitter and e-mail updates in between
training hours.

Weighing 145g, the Galaxy Beam is also a relatively heavy phone - at least, you
will know if it has slipped out of your pockets while you are running around.

This Android smartphone also comes with a pico projector, which lets you extend
its 4-inch display to a massive 50-inch projection on a blank wall. Pair that
with external speakers for a mini-cinema effect.

Motorola Defy XT

Now, here is a rugged smartphone that will not burn a hole in your pocket.

Similar to the Sony Xperia Go, it has the same IP67 rating that makes it
waterproof up to 1m for 30minutes and is resistant to dust particles.

Likewise, it runs on Android 2.3 Gingerbread, which is nearly two years old.

The edge it has over the Sony smartphone is its display.

At 3.7inches, the Defy XT is slightly larger and has a much better screen
resolution of 480 x 854 pixels. This creates sharper details and finer text when
you are browsing through your e-mail or scanning a website.

If you are concerned with its performance, its single-core 1GHz processor could
be the deal breaker though.

While most basic features, such as Web browsing, messaging and calls, can be
handled, it is not advisable to overload it with multiple apps.

Pair it with:

X-Mini II Capsule Speaker

Bring along this inexpensive and tiny - yet powerful - speaker to share your
music with everyone.

Created by home-grown brand Xmi, the X-Mini II Capsule speaker is more than
capable of filling up a small room. A larger area - say, your bunk - could prove
to be a challenge for the compact speaker though.

But if your bunk mate also has an X-Mini speaker, you can link both up and
extend the sound across the room.

Link a few more X-Mini speakers and you can create a makeshift cinema with a
decent surround sound system.
