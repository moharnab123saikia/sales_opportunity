What: The device represents Google's entry into the high-end laptop market. It
runs Google's Chrome OS operating system, which largely assumes you'll have
round-the-clock Internet access. You can still work with the device offline, but
functionality is limited.

Cost: The basic model costs $1,299 and comes with 32 gigabytes of storage. For
$1,449, you get 64 gigabytes and LTE connectivity through Verizon Wireless. Both
models come with a terabyte of online storage through Google Drive for three
years, a $1,800 value at $50 per month. Not everyone will need as much storage,
and Google Drive offers free and cheaper plans.

The pricier Pixel model also offers 100 megabytes a month of LTE cellular data
access through Verizon Wireless for two years.

Extras: If you need more, you can buy a day pass with unlimited data for $10. Or
you can buy 1 gigabyte of data for $20, 3 GB for $35 or 5 GB for $50. Those are
good for a month. If you're a Verizon customer with a plan for sharing data
allotments over multiple devices, you can add the Pixel for just $10 a month.

Where to buy it: The Pixel is sold through Google's online Play store and Best
Buy's website.
