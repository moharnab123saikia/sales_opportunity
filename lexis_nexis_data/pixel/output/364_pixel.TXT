Google Pixel shipments might hit 4 million this year

Looks like Google is setting high hopes for the Pixel handsets



Google is certainly aiming high with its latest Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones,

which comes with top hardware and a matching price tag, thus taking a dig at

manufacturers like Apple and Samsung.



According to DigiTimes Research, Google is expecting to sell around 3 to 4

million Pixel phones before the end of 2016. This may seem like a large goal,

but it is nothing compared to the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge sold an estimated 25.1

million units in the first half of 2016, while the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus which

sold 13 million units over their opening weekend, according to GfK.



Earlier, a limited availability and lack of advertising for Google's Nexus line

has kept the whole collection out of the spotlights and radar's of major

shipment companies. However, now that Google is competing directly with Android

manufacturers and Apple as well, we might see a change. The Google name should

offer the company a jump-start, but market data shows that this is now a tough

time to secure a strong market share as a smaller handset brand.



While it is still a long way to go for Google products, but it is safe to assume

that Google can actually reach that goal.
