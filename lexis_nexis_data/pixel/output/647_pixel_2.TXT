Dead Pixel CPR



Recently my LCD monitor had a permanent blue pixel after booting up the PC.

Being in the centre of the screen, it stood out like the proverbial. It didn't

really bother me at the time as my Samsung monitor had a 12-month "no-dead-pixel

" warranty. Out of curiosity I gave the pixel a gentle flick, and it returned to

its normal colour, and hasn't played up since. Apparently they are known as

"lazy" pixels - pixels that will come good with a little persuasion. Hopefully

knowing about lazy pixels may save some of your readers some grief.



I contacted LG about its dead-pixel policy on its LCD TVs. I Googled LG, but

found no details regarding its dead pixel policy. I rang its customer-care

number and was politely told, "If you wish to find out about LG's dead-pixel

policy I have been advised to tell you to look for it on the internet - I

suggest you Google it." I told the chap I just did that but he kept repeating

the advice. I have never heard of such ludicrous advice.
