New Delhi, Oct. 13 -- Zee Media Bureau
 Google's much-awaited Pixel - a new premium device completely designed by the
tech giant with Google Assistant built right-in is available for pre-order in
India from Thursday onwards.


 With an aim to lead the world of smartphones with its artificial intelligence
(AI)-based technology, Google had launched Pixel early this month.
 India is among the first six countries where Pixel is being launched. Starting
at Rs, 57,000, it will be available for pre-order in India on e-tailer website
Flipkart and at over 1,000 plus multi-brand retail stores, including Reliance
Digital, Croma and Vijay sales, among others.
 Flipkart has tweeted:
 The launch also ended the Nexus branding under which the company has always
released phones in partnership with other original equipment manufacturers like
LG (for Google Nexus 5) and Huawei (for Google Nexus 6P).
 Pixel is first smartphone with Google Assistant - a built-in AI programme that
works as an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator.
 With the Google Assistant, users can have a natural conversation with Google to
find answers or get things done on the go. Say "Ok Google" or touch and hold the
Home button and the Assistant is ready to help.
