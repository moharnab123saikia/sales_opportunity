More Google Pixel phone leaks surface from Verizon



LENGTH: 125  words





People just can't seem to get themselves to sit quietly and wait for Google to

make the official announcements. With just hours left before Google's big reveal

of its by now open secret Pixel phones, more leaks surfaced from Verizon.



The leak was found by Gizmodo in the carrier's Enterprise website. It featured

both the Pixel and Pixel XL in the smartphone section, reports Engadget.



The posts included short descriptions as well as a mention of a mysterious '

Google Magic' feature.



Evan Blass also tweeted a photo that featured several Verizon devices that

suggest two different color themes will be available, namely silver/white and

blue.



Could Google actually be doing this on purpose to create hype or are their

partners really just that careless?
