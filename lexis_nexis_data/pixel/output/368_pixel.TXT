make the official announcements. With just hours left before Google's big reveal
of its by now open secret Pixel phones, more leaks surfaced from Verizon.

The leak was found by Gizmodo in the carrier's Enterprise website. It featured
both the Pixel and Pixel XL in the smartphone section, reports Engadget.

The posts included short descriptions as well as a mention of a mysterious '
Google Magic' feature.

Evan Blass also tweeted a photo that featured several Verizon devices that
suggest two different color themes will be available, namely silver/white and
blue.

Could Google actually be doing this on purpose to create hype or are their
partners really just that careless?
