LENGTH: 177  words





Another one of Google's old products will no longer be available.



Google has been quite busy recently, with silently removing outdated products

from the Google Store. The Chromebook Pixel 2015 is the latest to that list.



Google has reportedly removed the $999 model of the 2015 Chromebook Pixel from

the Google Store website. However, the company is still selling the higher end

$1299 version of the ChromeOS notebook. This is the second product to be

removed, right after the HTC Nexus 9 Tablet. Google recently confirmed to

VentreBeat that the Chromebook 2015 will not be made available for sale again.



The $999 model came with an Intel Core i5 processor inside, along with 8GB of

RAM, 32GB of internal storage, and a touchscreen. The $1299 model on the other

hand comes with an Intel Core i7 chip, 16GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.



Google removed the $999 ChromebookÂ Pixel 2015 the same week the HP Chromebook 13

was announced, which is the first Chromebook to come with a 6th Generation Intel

Core M processor, and will be priced at $499.
