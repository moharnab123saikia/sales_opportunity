     路    Made to look good in your hands.





Pixel comes in two sizes, 5" or 5.5", and is available in two colours - Quite

Black and Very Silver. So you can choose the look that suits you best. Its

curved edges make it easy to hold and smooth to touch. With an aerospace-grade

aluminum unibody and smooth surfaces, the phone was made to look and feel good

in your hands.



     路    The first phone with the Google Assistant built in





Ask it questions. Tell it to do things. Your Google Assistant is always ready to

answer questions and help you get things done. Just say "Ok Google" or touch and

hold the Home button to start. Try it out!



Say "Ok Google" or touch and hold the Home button.



Ask your Assistant for help finding a nearby cafe: Say, "Ok Google, where is the

nearest cafe?



Then tap the mic and follow up with "remind me to leave for coffee with Maya at

7am".



     路    The highest rated smartphone camera, by DxOMark Mobile





With a DxoMark Mobile score of 89, Pixel's camera lets you take stunning photos

in low light, bright light or any light. #Nofilter needed. Catch action shots as

they happen with Smartburst, which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots. Use

Lens Blur to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, making your

subject pop. And capture dramatic landscapes or make faces glow with new

exposure controls.



     路    Your stuff, unlimited





Never lose a memory with free, unlimited online storage for your photos and

videos taken on your Pixel, stored at full resolution in Google Photos. Once

you've captured the moment, Google Photos keeps all your photos backed up,

organised, and searchable, so you can find and share them fast.
