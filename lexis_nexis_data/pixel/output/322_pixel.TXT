According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
camera system includes a single pixel photo-sensor disposed in or on a substrate
to acquire image data. A micro-lens is adjustably positioned above the single
pixel photo-sensor to focus external scene light onto the single pixel
photo-sensor. An actuator is coupled to the micro-lens to adjust a position of
the micro-lens relative to the single pixel photo-sensor to reposition the
micro-lens to focus the external scene light incident from different angles onto
the single pixel photo-sensor. Readout circuitry is coupled to readout the image
data associated with each of the different angles from the single pixel
photo-sensor."
