new Chromebook and exactly how similar it is to a Macbook Pro.

On Thursday, Google announced the release of its new Chromebook Pixel. The
laptop is a high-end version of Google's popular Chromebook, which, in basic
terms, relies heavily on cloud computing to run various programs and apps. While
previous Chromebooks have been moderately priced, the 12.8-inch, 2560x1700
touchscreen, 1.8GHz Chromebook Pixel will retail for around $1,500, a price that
places the Pixel firmly in competition with Apple's Macbook Pro.

Many users are discussing the pros and cons of the Pixel compared to the Macbook
Pro, causing the latter term to trend. Google+ user Chris Dave is impressed with
the Pixel's touchscreen, posting "I LOVE this! If anyone, for any reason feels
the need to buy me something just for the sake of it, then this is what i'd
like! My macbook pro is amazing, but this really is the future - touch screen,
ssd, the list goes on." Ronak Shah, however, will probably be staying with
Apple: "Instead of buying a Chromebook Pixel, buy a Retina MacBook Pro and
install Chrome. Case closed." Jesse Ng tweets, "chromeBOOK pixel looks so
identically rectANGLE macBOOK Pro."
Google+ users are also talking about the popular internet meme "Harlem Shake,"
which is trending in second place.
