United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patent no. 8,665,952 on

March 04, 2014, to Google Inc (California), titled as "Apparatus and method for

decoding video encoded using a temporal filter"

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Embodiments of an apparatus and method for decoding an encoded bitstream to

generate a video signal are taught. A decoder receives the bitstream and decodes

a portion thereof to obtain at least a portion of a predictive reference frame.

The reference frame is generated by, for example, selecting a filter set

including a target frame with a block having a plurality of pixels and at least

one adjacent frame, determining a coding mode associated with the block,

determining a block-specific factor derived from the coding mode, determining

weighted averages of pixels in the filter set and using the weighted averages to

generate the predictive reference frame. The decoder also generates a residual

from another portion of the encoded bitstream that represents a portion of a

frame of the plurality of frames and reconstructs the portion of the frame by

adding the residual to the predictive reference frame."



The patent was filed on November 28, 2011 Application no. 13/305,033
