time smartphone buyers. At the time of launch, Google had announced that more
devices will be launched in the Android One line in the future with other
manufacturers. Lava is the new manufacturer to get onboard the Android One
line-up with its pixel V1 phone.

As expected, the pixel V1 runs the latest version of Android - Android 5.1 with
guaranteed upgrade to upcoming Android updates. The new phone comes with major

The three phones in Android One line launched last year came with a 4.5-inch
display (854 x 480 pixels), quad core processor, 1GB RAM, 4GB storage and a
1,700mAh battery. Keeping pace with the competition, the pixel V1 has a 5.5-inch
IPS display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels protected by Dragon Trail
glass. Hardware specifications include 1.3Ghz quad core processor, 2GB RAM, 32GB

The dual SIM smartphone has USB host support, microSD slot for expansion
