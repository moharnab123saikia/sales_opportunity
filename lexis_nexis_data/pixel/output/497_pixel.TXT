Last year, Google launched the Android One line of smartphone aimed at first

time smartphone buyers. At the time of launch, Google had announced that more

devices will be launched in the Android One line in the future with other

manufacturers. Lava is the new manufacturer to get onboard the Android One

line-up with its pixel V1 phone.



As expected, the pixel V1 runs the latest version of Android - Android 5.1 with

guaranteed upgrade to upcoming Android updates. The new phone comes with major

hardware upgrade compared to the Android One devices launched last year.



The three phones in Android One line launched last year came with a 4.5-inch

display (854 x 480 pixels), quad core processor, 1GB RAM, 4GB storage and a

1,700mAh battery. Keeping pace with the competition, the pixel V1 has a 5.5-inch

IPS display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels protected by Dragon Trail

glass. Hardware specifications include 1.3Ghz quad core processor, 2GB RAM, 32GB

storage and a 2,650mAh battery.



The dual SIM smartphone has USB host support, microSD slot for expansion

(supports up to 32GB cards), 3G, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. Cameras have

also been updated - the primary camera is a 13M unit with f2.0 aperture and

support for full HD video recording whereas the front facing camera is an 8MP
