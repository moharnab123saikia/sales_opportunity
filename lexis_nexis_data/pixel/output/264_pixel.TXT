Enter the Pixel. Google unveils first smartphone in move to challenge Apple

GOOGLE has taken the battle for supremacy in the mobile phone market to Apple by

releasing its first direct competitor to the iPhone.



The Google Pixel, unveiled yesterday evening, is the first smartphone designed

by the company and that bears its name. Its launch came as Google made the

biggest foray into consumer electronics in its history and sought to shake off

its reputation as purely an internet software company.



Google has not traditionally attacked Apple head on, instead developing the

Android software that powers phones made by Samsung, HTC and others and

endorsing a range of Nexus handsets made by third parties. But while sales of

Android phones eclipse those of the iPhone, Apple, which uniquely designs both

the software and the hardware of its devices, has dominated the profitable high

end of the market.



At £599, or from £719 for a larger "XL" model, the Pixel is placed firmly in

Apple's premium segment and comes with extras such as Google's voice-controlled

artificial intelligence assistant, unlimited photo storage and an advanced

camera.



Unlike the previous series of Nexus phones, which were sold in limited

quantities and largely online, Google will also focus on distributing the Pixel

through mobile networks and retailers, selecting EE and Carphone Warehouse in

the UK.



"They are going towards an overall strategy where they want to make Google

relevant and beyond a search [engine]," said Roberta Cozza, a research director

at Gartner. "Android is doing perfectly well but it might be a way for them to

gain a little bit more control and identity, and make the Google brand a little

bit stronger than the Android brand, which has been pulled in too many

directions."



Ms Cozza added that while the Pixel phone will not necessarily outsell rivals,

it will serve as an example to other Android phone makers. The company has been

frustrated by partners tweaking the software to relegate Google's own services,

and the company's efforts to force manufacturers to adopt its services on

Android phones have drawn scrutiny from the European Commission, which has

accused the company of breaching competition law.



The phone's release comes as iPhone sales are falling for the first time, and

Samsung is embroiled in the fallout from an embarrassing recall of millions of

defective handsets.



Google unveiled a series of other new devices at a highly anticipated event in

San Francisco. It announced that the Google Home, its voice-controlled wireless

speaker, would be released later this month ahead of a UK launch next year. The

device follows the surprise success of Amazon's Echo speaker, which went on sale

in Britain last week and has left rivals scrambling to catch up.



The company also unveiled the Daydream View, a virtual reality headset.
