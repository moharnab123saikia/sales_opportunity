Google's smartphone launch signals a major shift into the competitive world of

hardware design, production, sales and customer service.



SAN FRANCISCO - Software giant Google is beginning an aggressive foray into

hardware production with the launch Tuesday of a smart-phone and other devices

that will bring the company into direct competition with other leading tech

firms, including its longtime partner Samsung.



The launch signals a major shift for one of the world's most profitable

companies as it seeks to adapt to a technology landscape increasingly dominated

by mobile and other connected hardware. Google must find a way, analysts say, to

keep acquiring user data for targeting ads as Web search - traditionally done

from laptop or desktop computers - is supplanted by newer technologies.



Google's new smartphone, the Pixel, will employ artificial-intelligence

technology that users can converse with, allowing them to sidestep keyboards as

they access online information and make purchases such as movie tickets, say

people familiar with the company's plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity

to reveal information ahead of its official release. The company also plans to

release other new hardware, including a voice-based assistant for the home to

rival Amazon's Echo and a virtual-reality headset to rival Facebook's Oculus.



These moves push Google beyond its traditional comfort zone - industry-leading

online portals for Web search, and popular apps for email and maps - and into

the harshly competitive world of hardware design, production, sales and customer

service in which the company has only dabbled. The company has relied on

partners such as Samsung and Huawei to sell devices loaded with free Google

software, including the Android mobile operating system.



"Android is ubiquitous now, but as people shift into these new patterns for

interacting with the Web, Google has less and less reach," said Benedict Evans,

partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. "They

have you for Web search, but not for the other things that you increasingly do.

This is both an existential and a strategic problem for Google."



The launch of the Pixel - which was to be heralded this week by prime-time

television ads during "Monday Night Football" and "The Voice," as well as

billboards and installations in London, Sydney, Berlin and New York - will test

Google's mettle in a new kind of business. The shift toward hardware also puts

the company on a collision course with Apple, Amazon and Facebook, and with

partners such as Samsung that have used Google's free Android software to build

their own global smartphone empires.



Samsung's Galaxy phones are the most popular high-end smartphones in the United

States after Apple's iPhone.



Free of dependence



Samsung and Google have engaged in a tug of war in recent years, each trying to

shake free of its dependence on the other, said people familiar with the

situation. Google in recent years has tested the hardware market, with a spotty

record, including limited efforts to sell its own line of smartphones, its

purchase (and later sale) of Motorola and release of other troubled products

such as Google Glass.



Samsung, meanwhile, has gone so far as building its own mobile operating system

and app marketplace, Tizen, as a hedge against the company's dependence on

Android.



Samsung declined to comment.



"Google's challenge is that Android's success has also been its greatest

weakness," said Jeffrey Hammond, principal analyst at Forrester.



The Android operating system is used by Samsung, Huawei, HTC and dozens of other

manufacturers. But Google's licensing deals with manufacturers - offering the

smartphone operating system and the popular Google Play Store app marketplace to

manufacturers only if they agree to bundle it with other Google apps - has

generated antitrust scrutiny in Europe.



It also has left Google with little control over the devices, opening them to

security flaws while hampering the company's ability to leverage the popularity

of Android as a path to other Google-provided services, such as the growing

market for artificial intelligence.



Many tech companies have tried and failed to produce smartphones. Smartphones

released by both Facebook and Amazon over the past two years have flopped.

Microsoft - another software giant that moved into the hardware business - sold

Nokia two years after buying it.



In 2011, Google bought smartphone maker Motorola for $12.5 billion and sold it

for less than a quarter of that amount three years later, reportedly because the

ownership of Motorola caused problems with its other manufacturer partners.



The Pixel will be manufactured by HTC and cost about $650, according to people

familiar with the company's plans, though different payment options will be

available.



The Pixel is also expected to be branded exclusively as a Google phone. This

stands in contrast to the packaging for Nexus phones, the largely obscure line

of Android phones that Google has produced with manufacturer partners since

2010, which had the names of both manufacturers and Google on its packaging.



Google's cash cow



Google plans to build out an extensive customer service and marketing operation

to accompany the Pixel devices, said individuals familiar with the company's

plans.
