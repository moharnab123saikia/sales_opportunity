Google to build its own phone

If rumors are to be believed, Google is apparently working on designing its own

chips for Android devices.



According to the latest rumors, Google might be working on a in-house chip for

Android device, however it is not sure if the chip is for any Android phone, or

a phone made by Google itself. This has further fuelled the rumors if Google is

indeed working on its own device, which apparently Google is seriously

considering.



Rumors have been around of Google's Pixel phone concept, which does seem to be

getting closer to being a reality, but there are still a lot of steps for Google

to take. Rumors area also ablaze of Google's Nexus partners to be not so happy

as the amount of feedback and reward they get for the hard work put into the

Nexus devices does not pay off. If that was not enough, the amount of legal

procedures from regarding the permissions manufacturers have to access Google

Play and Google Apps, all give Google a good reason to focus on building its own

hardware.



Although, would you get a Google Pixel phone?
