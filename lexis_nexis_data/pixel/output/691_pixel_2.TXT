According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Methods and systems are provided that use images to determine lighting
information for an object. A computing device can receive an image of the
object. For a pixel of the image, the computing device can: apply a first
lighting model to determine a first estimate of a bi-directional lighting
function (BRDF) for the object at the pixel, apply a second lighting model to
determine a second estimate of the BRDF for the object at the pixel, determine a
third estimate of the BRDF based on the first and second estimates, and store
the third estimate of the BRDF in lighting-storage data. The computing device
can provide the lighting-storage data. The BRDF can utilize a number of lighting
parameters, such as a normal vector and albedo, reflectivity, and roughness
values."
