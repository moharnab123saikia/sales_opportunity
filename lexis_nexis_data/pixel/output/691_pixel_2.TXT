According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Methods and systems are provided that use images to determine lighting

information for an object. A computing device can receive an image of the

object. For a pixel of the image, the computing device can: apply a first

lighting model to determine a first estimate of a bi-directional lighting

function (BRDF) for the object at the pixel, apply a second lighting model to

determine a second estimate of the BRDF for the object at the pixel, determine a

third estimate of the BRDF based on the first and second estimates, and store

the third estimate of the BRDF in lighting-storage data. The computing device

can provide the lighting-storage data. The BRDF can utilize a number of lighting

parameters, such as a normal vector and albedo, reflectivity, and roughness

values."
