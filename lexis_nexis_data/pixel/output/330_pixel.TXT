According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
camera system includes a single pixel photo-sensor disposed in or on a substrate
to acquire image data. A micro-lens is adjustably positioned above the single
pixel photo-sensor to focus external scene light onto the single pixel
photo-sensor. An actuator is coupled to the micro-lens to adjust a position of
the micro-lens relative to the single pixel photo-sensor. A controller controls
the actuator to sequentially reposition the micro-lens to focus the external
scene light incident from different angles onto the single pixel photo-sensor.
Readout circuitry is coupled to sequentially readout the image data associated
with each of the different angles from the single pixel photo-sensor."

The patent was filed on March 15, 2013 Application no. 13/839,876
