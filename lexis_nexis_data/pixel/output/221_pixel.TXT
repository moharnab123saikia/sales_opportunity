With Google's October 4th event just around the corner, leaks have already
started to make its rounds around the web. A new leak recently shows what could
be Google's next flagship Pixel smartphone.

The new leak is what appears to be an official image of the Google Pixel, which
also confirms that the Pixel and its bigger brother Pixel XL will be unveiled at
the October 4th event. The leak shows a device which is allegedly the Pixel and
not the Pixel XL. The phone appears to be a very minimalist device with large
bezels and buttons such as power and volume rockers on the right side of the
device.

If the rumors are true, the smaller device is expected to start at $649, which
would set the bar of the Pixel lineup higher than the Nexus brand. Both devices
are expected to initially launch on Verizon and as unlocked devices in the US.
