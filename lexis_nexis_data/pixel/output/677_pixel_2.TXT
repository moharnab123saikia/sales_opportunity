Asus Transformer Pad TF701



With a high-resolution 2,560 x 1,600 pixel screen, the Asus Transformer Pad is

among the top tablets in terms of pixel density.



Powering this display is Nvidia's strong Tegra 4 chip running at a whopping

1.9GHz with 2GB of RAM.



Besides the top-notch hardware, the Asus Transformer Pad has a keyboard

accessory which extends its already impressive 13-hour battery life by another

four hours.



Attaching the keyboard dock adds a USB 3.0 port and an SD card reader,

transforming it into a laptop.



Google Nexus 7



For Android purists, the Google Nexus 7 is undoubtedly the tablet to get. But

even non-Android users will appreciate the stunning 1,920 x 1,200 pixel display

on this 7-inch tablet. There is a negligible air gap between the LCD and the

protective glass, which reduces reflection.



Equally attractive are the Nexus 7's quad-core processor, dual cameras and

support for wireless charging. The clincher may be its competitive price tag,

starting from $429 for the Wi-Fi model.



LG G Tablet 8.3



LG's G Tablet 8.3 should be on your shortlist if you want a small, handy tablet.

It weighs just 338g, but packs some impressive hardware, including a quad-core

CPU and a 1,920 x 1,200 pixel display.



Then, there are the apps. The Q Pair app lets you get notifications from a

supported LG Android phone when you are using the tablet. Apps can run next to

each other using the QSlide Function feature.



Samsung Note 10.1 2014



The refreshed Samsung Note 10.1 gets a high-resolution 2,560 x 1,600 pixel

screen and a more streamlined design, with a textured back that is easier to

hold. Though it is lighter, it still feels sturdy.



The S Pen stylus remains its chief distinguishing feature. Samsung has improved

the stylus software. The Note is one of a few Android devices that supports app

multitasking in multiple windows side by side.



Sony Xperia Tablet Z



The 10-inch Z slate is so slim and light that it can slip from your hands in a

careless moment. Released early last year, it is still one of the thinnest

tablets in the market. It has a high-resolution 1,920 x 1,200 pixel screen and a

quad-core processor.



Its water-resistance feature is impressive. It can survive being under 1m of

water for up to 30 minutes.
