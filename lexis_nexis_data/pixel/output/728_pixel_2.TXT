Lots of Android devices may have carried the Nexus brand but the new Pixel C,

unveiled on Tuesday is the first tablet built 'end-to-end' by Google itself.



The last time Google built its own hardware, the resulting device the Chromebook

Pixel was high on quality - it looked like an Apple MacBook Pro - but was

similarly high on price, costing $5000.



The Pixel C takes the Microsoft Surface Pro for inspiration instead and features

a full-sized, hinged yet detachable keyboard that can be used with or instead of

the device's 10.2-inch HD touchscreen display.



Behind the aluminium shell it will be powered by the latest Nvidia Tegra X1

processor and will come with 32GB or 64GB of on board storage.



As for when it will be going on sale, all that Google will say is that it will

be available before the holiday season gets into full swing and that prices will

start at $499 for a 32GB version without the keyboard.
