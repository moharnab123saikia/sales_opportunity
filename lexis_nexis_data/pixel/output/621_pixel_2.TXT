According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
tileable display panel includes an illumination layer, a display layer, and a
screen layer. The display layer is disposed between the screen layer and the
lamp layer and includes pixelets separated from each other by spacing regions.
Each of the pixelets is positioned to be illuminated by lamp light from the
illumination layer and to project a magnified image sub-portion onto the
backside of the screen layer such that the magnified image sub-portions
collectively blend together to form a unified image on the screen layer which
covers the spacing regions on the display layer. Each of the pixelets includes
core pixels having a common size and a first separation pitch and peripheral
pixels surrounding the core pixels on two or more sides which provide a higher
image resolution in overlap regions on the screen layer when the magnified image
sub-portions overlap on the screen layer."
