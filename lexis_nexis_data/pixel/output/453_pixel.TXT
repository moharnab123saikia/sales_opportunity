display panel including an array of display pixels disposed surrounded by a

size, and an optical expansion layer disposed over the array of display pixels

to magnify the display image to appear to have a second size larger than the

first size and to at least partially conceal the bezel surrounding the housing.

The optical expansion layer includes a first array of microlenses optically

coupled to the array of display pixels to cause light from the display pixels to

diverge, a second array of microlenses having complementary optical power to the

first array of microlenses; and an optically transparent offset layer disposed

between the first and second arrays of microlenses. Other embodiments are

disclosed and claimed."
