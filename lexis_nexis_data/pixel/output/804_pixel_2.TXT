While we are still waiting for the Google Nexus 7 tablet in many corners of the

world, Google is reportedly working on another Google Nexus 7 tablet. The second

generation of this tablet might use the next generation processor from Qualcomm.



Sources have told Reuters (http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/03/us-google

-nexus-idUSBRE93205L20130403) that Google

(http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=GOOG.O&lc=int_mb_1001)

will launch a new version of its Nexus 7 tablet July this year. This latest

second generation of tablet will have a higher screen resolution, a thinner

bezel design and adopt Qualcomm's chip. The current model  uses a Nvidia Tegra

3, quad-core processor clocked at a speed of 1.2 GHz.



Seth Weintraub (http://9to5google.com/author/sethweintraub/) of 9to5google

(http://9to5google.com/2013/04/03/second-generation-qualcomm-based-nexus-7-to-de

but-in-july-with-improved-display-says-reuters/) expects a likely change to the

Snapdragon 600 or 800 processor. We would also like go with Seth but, we would

expect a Snapdragon 800

(http://www.qualcomm.com/media/documents/qualcomm-snapdragon-800-product-brief)

quad-core processor which could be clocked at 2.3 GHz and will support amazing

and very sharp display, better than its competitors. Snapdragon 800 is already

out and is expected to come to the LG Optimus G2. On the Optimus G2 the

processor will support 1080 by 1794 pixel screen. (read here

un-on-snapdragon-800-4222165-NOR.html))



Reuters expects a higher resolution display, which would mean better than the

current 1280 by 800 display at 254 pixel per inches. This also makes us believe

that Snapdragon 800 will come to tablet with the second generation Google Nexus

7. Someone was faster than us to expect this and has already updated the

Wikipedia page with Google Nexus 7 inch  2.0 along with the LG Optimus G2 (read

here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)#Snapdragon_800)).

This needs to be confirmed yet, and we are waiting to hear more.



Google usually releases its devices at a Developer's program, and one of these

is to be organized in middle of May, which is the Google I/O

(http://www.droid-life.com/tag/googleio/) event. Since this new tablet is not

arriving at this program, which also strengthens the speculations around the use

of Snapdragon 800 processor.



Well, for information, Samsung Galaxy S4 launched with the Snapdragon 600

quad-core and opted for the octa-core Exynos for its other variant.
