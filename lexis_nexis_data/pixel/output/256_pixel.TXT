Google Chromebook Pixel review: beautiful, powerful - but still just Chrome;

With an all-aluminium body, powerful processor and 12-hour-plus battery life the

Pixel is the best Chromebook going, but at a price

The Chromebook Pixel is Google's vision of what a computer should be like - with

a high-resolution screen, excellent battery life and solid aluminium body, with

apps and data stored in the cloud.



But the Pixel is a contradiction - at £799 it's an expensive machine that uses

an operating system designed for cheap computers.



Aluminium, glass and glowing strips



Most Chromebooks cost under £250 and are made from cheaper materials and with

low-end specifications.



The Pixel is machined from high-grade matt aluminium similar to high-end

ultrabooks, and using high-end components. The design is understated and

minimal, with squared edges and subtle branding.



A single light-up strip in the lid indicates whether the computer is on.

Double-tap it with the lid closed and it'll show you the current battery level.



Open, it looks like any other high-end laptop, with a full-sized backlit chiclet

keyboard that's well-made with good responsive keys, a smooth glass multi-touch

trackpad and a black glass touchscreen.



It has speakers hidden under the keyboard that distort at maximum volume, but

are quite loud and clear.



The screen is excellent, with deep blacks and accurate colours. It is also

higher-resolution than most other laptops, rivalling Apple's retina displays and

Dell's new Ultrasharp QHD+ in pixel density, which makes text, objects and

images pin-sharp and very easy to read.



In common with Apple's retina displays and modern smartphones and tablets, the

Pixel defaults to a resolution that isn't the maximum the screen can display,

making objects on the screen tiny, but one that uses the extra pixels to render

the objects in higher clarity with sharper edges referred to as a "HiDPI".



At 1.5Kg the Pixel is light enough to stuff into a backpack and is lighter than

a 1.58Kg 13in MacBook Pro, but heavier than Dell's 1.26Kg XPS 13 and Apple's

0.92Kg MacBook. It's also 15.3mm thick, which is thinner than both the 18mm

thick 13in MacBook Pro and the 20mm thick Dell XPS 13. Apple's super-thin

13.1mm-thick MacBook has it beat, however.



Specifications



     ·    Screen: 12.85in 2560 x 1700 resolution (239 pixels per inch)

     ·    Processor: 2.2GHz Intel Core i5

     ·    RAM: 8GB

     ·    Storage: 32GB, SD card reader

     ·    Connectivity: Wi-Fi (802.11ac), Bluetooth 4.0, USB3.0, USB type C

     ·    Camera: 720p wide angle web cam

     ·    Dimensions: 297.7 x 224.6 x 15.3mm

     ·    Weight: 1.5Kg







Over 12 hours per charge



The outside of the Pixel is more premium than any other Chromebook, but so are

the components on the inside, which could be described as overkill for something

that's designed to live in the cloud and uses an operating system that's

basically just a web browser.



The 2.2GHz Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM make everything super smooth. Web

pages load noticeably faster on the Pixel than most other computers I've tested,

while apps from the Chrome store are snappy and responsive.



Chrome OS doesn't have any demanding apps, so it's difficult to see why it needs

to be quite so powerful. The touchscreen is also accurate and responsive, and

comes in handy for pinch to zoom gestures, scrolling and simple taps.



The Pixel is well equipped with ports and connectivity. The usual suspects of

Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi 802.11ac are present, as are two USB 3.0 ports and an SD

card reader. It also has two USB type-C ports, one either side of the machine.

They're used for charging as well as multiple inputs and outputs including

connecting to external displays. A USB C to HDMI or DisplayPort adapter will be

required, however.



One of the criticisms of the previous generation of Pixel released in 2013 was

poor battery life. The new 2015 Pixel has almost everything roundly trounced.

It's rated for 12-hours per charge, but I easily saw 13 hours plus in general

usage.



Charging via USB C and the very Apple-like charger is easy and fast, with a full

charge taking about two hours or up to two hours battery life after charging for

about 15 minutes. The Pixel can be charged from either USB C port, which is very

handy.



The only thing Google skimped on for the Pixel was storage, fitting only 32GB of

flash. Google intends for everything but a few local files to be stored in the

cloud and gives users 1TB of space on Google Drive for three years with every

Pixel purchase.



Considering there are no real applications to download and Google Music stores

it all in the cloud, 32GB will be enough for most. More can be added via the SD

card slot or a USB flash drive if needed.



Chrome, with a few Android apps



The Pixel runs Google's Chrome OS, which is essentially a whole computer based

around the company's Chrome browser. That generally limits the functionality to

only things that can be done with a web browser, which people stuck using

traditional computers might be surprised to find out is most things.



Office duties, emailing, messaging, image editing, streaming music and video can

all be done through the browser. The only thing I've struggled to do with the

Pixel is edit video, but even some things can be done with a few web apps.



Chrome OS can also run a selection of Android apps, which helps expand what can

be done. Evernote and Wunderlist are a few of my favourites. But Chrome OS

cannot run applications such as Apple's iTunes or Adobe's Photoshop.



Generally speaking, Chrome OS can do 95% of what people need to do with a

computer, easily and efficiently 95% of the time. The trouble comes when you

need to do something it can't that a regular PC or Apple laptop could.



It is possible to install Linux on the Pixel, and the majority of developers who

own one will likely do that, which opens up a whole other application ecosystem.





Price



The Google Chromebook Pixel costs £799. A more powerful version with an Intel

Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and a 64GB SSD costs £999. For comparison, Dell's

XPS 13 with a similar display costs £1,099 and Apple's 13in MacBook Pro costs

£999.



Verdict



The Google Chromebook Pixel 2015 is undoubtedly the best Chrome OS computer.

It's also a very good laptop, competing on hardware terms with the very best of

them.



But while Chrome OS is very capable most of the time, and makes for an excellent

second computer for browsing the web and other light duties, it can't run

traditional Windows or OS X apps. That 5% of the time when a full application

like iTunes is needed, or some video needs editing, or an image needs heavy

editing in a powerful piece of software such as Photoshop, that's where Chrome

OS falls down.



For £800 the Pixel is overkill as a Chromebook, but it is a fantastic Chromebook

and if that's what's required, then the Pixel is perfect. For most people, that

£800 is better spent on a PC or Mac laptop.



Pros: fast, aluminium body, fantastic high resolution screen, 12+ hours battery,

USB C, zero maintenance required  Cons: Chrome OS still limited for some things,

three to four times the price of other Chromebooks, very little local storage
