the year.

Aside from to new smartphones expected to be released this year, rumours are
surfacing that Google will also soon announced a new 7-inch Android tablet.

According to tipster Evan Blass, a Google tablet built by Huawei with 4GB RAM is
"on track for release before the end of the year." We've already seen reports
recently that Google is closing off the Nexus smartphone line, in favour of a
new "Pixel" lineup of smartphones. The Pixel and Pixel XL are expected to be
announced at a Google event October 4 this year, though we've already seen
rumoured specifications for both smartphones.

However, some interesting facts point toward a possible revitalization of
Google's tablets under the same Nexus name. Phandroid pointed that Huawei
registered a trademark for the "Huawei 7P" earlier this year, and Tech Times
also speculated on possible specs for the device.

If indeed Google is attempting to rejuvenate its tablet lineup, it's a sorely
needed move, given that Android tablet sales have been flagging, aside from a
few exceptions like the Yoga Book.

Of course, while Evan Blass is known for his credible leak sources, we'll know
for sure once it's time for Google's October 4 event.
