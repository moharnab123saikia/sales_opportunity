Rumours are surfacing that a new tablet is on track to launch before the end of

the year.



Aside from to new smartphones expected to be released this year, rumours are

surfacing that Google will also soon announced a new 7-inch Android tablet.



According to tipster Evan Blass, a Google tablet built by Huawei with 4GB RAM is

"on track for release before the end of the year." We've already seen reports

recently that Google is closing off the Nexus smartphone line, in favour of a

new "Pixel" lineup of smartphones. The Pixel and Pixel XL are expected to be

announced at a Google event October 4 this year, though we've already seen

rumoured specifications for both smartphones.



However, some interesting facts point toward a possible revitalization of

Google's tablets under the same Nexus name. Phandroid pointed that Huawei

registered a trademark for the "Huawei 7P" earlier this year, and Tech Times

also speculated on possible specs for the device.



If indeed Google is attempting to rejuvenate its tablet lineup, it's a sorely

needed move, given that Android tablet sales have been flagging, aside from a

few exceptions like the Yoga Book.



Of course, while Evan Blass is known for his credible leak sources, we'll know

for sure once it's time for Google's October 4 event.
