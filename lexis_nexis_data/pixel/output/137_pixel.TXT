smartphones to compete directly with the iPhone 7. Both phones have 12-megapixel
cameras with optical stabilisation and an f2.0 lens. Google claims that the
camera has the best industry technical score of any smartphone. They also have
32GB of storage memory and a bigger battery than the iPhone 7. Both the Pixel
and Pixel XL have a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone. There are two
colours, called 'Quite Black' and 'Very Silver'. They have curved edges and an
aluminium unibody. Google says that the Pixel has a DxOMark Mobile score of 89,
besting the iPhone 7 and Samsung S7.

It says the camera is excellent in low light and has features such as 'lens
blur', which generate shallow-depth-of-field effects. Tapping the 'Support' tab
in 'Settings' now gets you to a Google expert who will help you with queries.
The company says you can share your screen with the expert for step-by-step
help.

The battery in the Pixel is larger than most rivals. A quick 15-minute charge
gives you up to seven hours of use. It also unlocks immediately with the
fingerprint reader. It has a one-tap video-calling feature called Google Duo
built in. With the iPhone's Facetime clearly in mind, the Pixel phone uses
Google Duo with both Android phones and iPhones. (The Google Duo app can be
downloaded in the iPhone App Store and the Google Play Store.) Lastly, it has
Google Assistant built in. You can ask this phone to do things by starting with
the phrase "Ok Google" or by touching and holding the Home button to start.
