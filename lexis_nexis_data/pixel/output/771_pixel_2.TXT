According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
method for encoding a frame having a plurality of blocks in a video stream using
transform-domain intra prediction is disclosed. The method includes generating,
using a two-dimensional transform, a set of transform coefficients for a current
block; generating, using a one-dimensional transform, a set of transform
coefficients for previously coded pixel values in the frame; determining, using
the set of transform coefficients for the previously coded pixel values, a set
of transform coefficients for a prediction block; determining a residual based
on the difference between the set of transform coefficients for the current
block and the set of coefficients for the prediction block; and encoding the
residual."

The Patent was filed on August 10, 2012 under application No. 20140044166
