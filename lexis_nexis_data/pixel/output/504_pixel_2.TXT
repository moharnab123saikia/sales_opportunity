Motorola Nexus 6 is Google's take on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus



LENGTH: 269  words





Google's new Nexus Smartphone launched in partnership with Motorola was unveiled

last night via a blog post. The Nexus 6 boasts the power of Android's latest

update - the Lollipop (5.0 version) on board, which was also announced last

night along with the HTC-built Nexus 9 tablet.



The Nexus 6 is a powerhouse with a Qualcomm's Snapdragon 805 chipset paired with

3GB of RAM, which should be good to power up the giant 5.96-inch display device.

This apart, the Smartphone brings a 13-megapixel snapper and other premium

features on-board, all of which make it a tough competitor against high-end

Android Smartphones from top tier brands as well as the newly launched iPhone

6s.



Since the Nexus 6 dons a 6-inch display, it is obvious that the phone will be

compared against the Iphone 6 Plus which will be up on sale starting tonight in

India.



Here we give you specification comparison between the two beasts with different

operating systems.
