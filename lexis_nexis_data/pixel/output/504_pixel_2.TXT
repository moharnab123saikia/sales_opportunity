last night via a blog post. The Nexus 6 boasts the power of Android's latest
update - the Lollipop (5.0 version) on board, which was also announced last
night along with the HTC-built Nexus 9 tablet.

The Nexus 6 is a powerhouse with a Qualcomm's Snapdragon 805 chipset paired with
3GB of RAM, which should be good to power up the giant 5.96-inch display device.
This apart, the Smartphone brings a 13-megapixel snapper and other premium
features on-board, all of which make it a tough competitor against high-end
Android Smartphones from top tier brands as well as the newly launched iPhone
6s.

Since the Nexus 6 dons a 6-inch display, it is obvious that the phone will be
compared against the Iphone 6 Plus which will be up on sale starting tonight in
India.

Here we give you specification comparison between the two beasts with different
operating systems.
