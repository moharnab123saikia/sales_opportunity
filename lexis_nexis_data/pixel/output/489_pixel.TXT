Block & Leviton LLP Investigates Misleading Advertisements and Breaches of

Contract by Google and Verizon in Connection with Sales of Chromebook Pixel



LENGTH: 183  words





June 23 -- Block & Leviton LLP a Boston-based law firm representing consumers

nationwide, has commenced an investigation into potential breaches of contract,

fraudulent misrepresentations, and/or violations of state consumer protection

laws committed by Google, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Verizon Communications, Inc.

(NYSE: VZ). The investigation relates to Google and Verizon's failure to honor

promises made to purchasers of Google's Chromebook Pixel computers about the

terms of free data plans provided with the Chromebooks.







When Google began selling the Chromebook Pixel in April 2013, the product was

advertised as coming with a free two-year mobile broadband plan from Verizon,

providing up to 100 MB of free data per month. According to several reports on

June 23, 2014, however, Verizon began disconnecting customers in April 2014 and

informing them that their free data plans expired after one year.



Block & Leviton's investigation seeks to determine, among other things, whether

Google and/or Verizon violated any state consumer protection laws or breached

any duties owed to their customers.
