

June 23 -- Block & Leviton LLP a Boston-based law firm representing consumers
nationwide, has commenced an investigation into potential breaches of contract,
fraudulent misrepresentations, and/or violations of state consumer protection
laws committed by Google, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Verizon Communications, Inc.
(NYSE: VZ). The investigation relates to Google and Verizon's failure to honor
promises made to purchasers of Google's Chromebook Pixel computers about the
terms of free data plans provided with the Chromebooks.



When Google began selling the Chromebook Pixel in April 2013, the product was
advertised as coming with a free two-year mobile broadband plan from Verizon,
providing up to 100 MB of free data per month. According to several reports on
June 23, 2014, however, Verizon began disconnecting customers in April 2014 and
informing them that their free data plans expired after one year.

Block & Leviton's investigation seeks to determine, among other things, whether
Google and/or Verizon violated any state consumer protection laws or breached
any duties owed to their customers.
