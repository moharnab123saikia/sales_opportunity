

Because Google "ran out of time"

Google's latest smartphones, Pixel and Pixel XL may not be waterproof, and the
reason behind it is quite simple. Google simply didn't have the time.

During a podcast with WIRED, David Pierce, who reviewed the phone for the site,
shared some inside information regarding the water resistant features of the
handset. He says that, when he asked Google why the phone isnt waterproof, the
reply was "We ran out of time". This makes sense, as the development cycle for
the smartphone was uncharacteristically short, reportedly "nine months and a
week" from design to launch, mainly because Google had to abandon s original
plans for the phone at the end of 2015.

Google initially wanted to have a waterproof phone, found on flagships like the
iPhone 7 or the Galaxy S7. However, to stay with the competition, the deadlines
were tight, probably why Google didn't have the time to focus on the
waterproofing. Instead, the Pixel and Pixel XL instead feature IP53
certification for dust and water resistance, meaning they can withstand splashes

 of water but not submersion.
