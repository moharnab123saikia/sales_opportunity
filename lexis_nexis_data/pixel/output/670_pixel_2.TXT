After releasing their very-own line of smartphones, Google is rumoured to launch

two Android 2.0 smartwatches early next year.



The rumour comes from serial tipster Evan Blass, who stated that the company is

set to unveil its smartwatches in Q1 2017. Codenamed Angelfish and Swordfish,

these two devices are expected to complement the newly launched Google Pixel and

Pixel XL.



According to previous leaks, Angelfish will be the larger variant, sporting a

premium design. It will be similar to the Moto 360 and LG's Urbane 2nd Edition

LTE. The design is said to have visible lugs, with a smooth housing shape that

curves where the watch band meets the body. At over 14mm, it will have GPS, LTE,

and a heart-rate monitor as well.



Swordfish, on the other hand, is smaller and thinner than Angelfish, with a body

diameter of 42mm and a thickness of just 10.6mm - 0.8mm. It will be available in

silver, titanium, and rose gold color variants. It will support Google's

interchangeable MODE watch bands and will be compatible with MODE bands too.

Both devices will have Google Assistant, the new Siri competitor unveiled early

this month as well.
