The phone sports a 5 megapixel shooter and 1.3 megapixel front camera. Though
this is not a great camera when compared to the 13 megapixel Indian players are
offering in budget phones, considering the low-cost of this phone, this should
be okay. The phone packs a battery of 2070 mAh that can support you for a whole
day, and runs Android 4.3.

The phone is expected to cost between Rs 11000 to Rs 12000 in Indian market.
Since the phone via eBay India comes from an international seller the cost is a
bit on the higher side. But the post indeed indicate that phone is going to be
available soon in the country. We would advise you to wait till Google formally
launches this phone.
