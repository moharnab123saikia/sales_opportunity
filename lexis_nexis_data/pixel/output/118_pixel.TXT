Google is pushing into the hardware business - but it still can't stop talking

about software.



The search giant on Tuesday unveiled the first-ever Google-made smartphone,

called the Pixel, as well as a virtual-reality headset and a $129 home speaker

called Google Home that will take aim at Amazon's popular $180 Echo.



"We're just getting started" with the hardware push, Google Chief Executive

Sundar Pichai admitted at a San Francisco shindig that was webcast Tuesday

afternoon.



While the hardware certainly stole the show, Google brass were equally keen on

showing off how the new gadgets worked with Google Assistant, the latest version

of the company's voice-activated competitor to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa.



"In many ways, we've been working on this since Google was founded 18 years

ago," Pichai said, touting Google Assistant's prowess in voice recognition,

image recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence.



"Remember my bike combo is 3-2-6," a user told the digital helper in a video

demo, getting the response, "Got it." More than a few attendees must have sensed

the executives at the Mountain View, Calif., tech behemoth were oblivious to

growing privacy concerns around voice-activated software.



Google's Pixel phone will cost $649 - less than Apple's iPhone 7, priced at

about $800 - but otherwise it's a gadget that looks a lot like the iPhone 7.

Except the Pixel has a headphone jack.



A larger, $769 "Pixel XL" model with a 5.5-inch screen, versus 5 inches for the

regular Pixel, will also be available. Pixels can also get seven hours of

battery time on a 15-minute charge, execs said. Both will be launched

exclusively on Verizon.



"There's no unsightly 'camera bump,' " added Google hardware chief Rick

Osterloh, noting that the Pixel's camera lens didn't awkwardly protrude from the

back the way those of recent iPhone models do.



The real selling point, execs said, is that the Pixel's integration with Google

Assistant, which it says can give smoother interactions and better answers than

the competition can.



Brian Rakowski, head of software product management for the Pixel, demonstrated

how the new phone used Google Assistant's advanced algorithms to give directions

and reviews for an Italian restaurant his wife mentioned in a text message -

without even being asked to do so.



Google Home will hit retail stores next month.



Amazon released the Echo nearly two years ago. The Echo has a software

developer's kit that's now used by more than 3,000 third-party developers to

play music, provide weather forecasts, keep shopping lists and order food.



Google Assistant will launch an SDK for third parties next year, execs said.



Elsewhere, Google unveiled a VR headset it calls Daydream View, which uses a

smartphone and will begin selling next month for $79. Google also is launching a

new line of Wi-Fi routers ($129 each, $299 for a set of three), and is updating

its ChromeCast TV dongle to stream 4K videos.
