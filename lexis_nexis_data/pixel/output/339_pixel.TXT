Google has revealed its new own-built smartphone, Pixel, which the tech giant

says has been built with artificial intelligence in mind, at a live press event

in San Francisco.



The Pixel has Google Assistant built into its software, the firm's artificial

intelligence program that is designed to understand context and help with tasks.



The new phone was unveiled at an event in San Francisco, and comes in both a 5in

and 5.5in size.



It has been billed by Google as housing the "best smartphone camera ever made"

and the first device to be built to work with Google's new Daydream virtual

reality platform.



Users will be able to access the Assistant AI program from any screen on the

device, and it will be able to understand context.



When demonstrated on stage, Pixel was able to find details on a restaurant that

was mentioned in a text message conversation - offering contact details, photos

and directions.



Google chief Sundar Pichai said the Pixel marked the beginning of a new era in

computing and smartphones.



"We're at a seminal moment in computing," he said.



"We've always had big shifts in computing in every 10 years or so. It began in

the 1980s with personal computers. In the 90s the web arrived and it was the

biggest platform shift ever.



"10 years later in the mid 2000s, we had the smartphone revolution. Now the

shift continues. We are evolving from a mobile first to AI first world."



Google also revealed the first virtual reality headset for its new Daydream VR

platform, Daydream View.



Unlike rival headsets - including Samsung's Gear VR - View is finished in

fabric, a conscious design decision, the tech giant said, aimed at replicating

the type of materials used in other wearable products.



The new headset is powered by placing the new Pixel smartphone into it, though

Google did also confirm that future Android phones would also come with Daydream

support.



It will enable users to watch YouTube videos and access Google Maps in virtual

reality, as well as play games.



The headset is also supported by a companion controller that can be used as a

remote as well as a way to write and draw in virtual reality.



The tech giant revealed that the View headset will go on sale in November.



Google also introduced a range of new products aimed at creating a "smart home".



This included Google WiFi, a new system of small WiFi receivers placed around a

home to build a network that will improve signal, the internet company said.



The system will also enable users to control access to the internet, turning off

WiFi during dinner time for example.



The tech giant's popular Chromecast streaming device has also been updated to

now support 4K definition for the first time, as well as high dynamic range

(HDR) content, which offers better picture quality.



The new Chromecast Ultra will cost Â£69 when it launches later this year.



As expected, the firm's smart speaker aiming to rival Amazon's recently-launched

Echo was also unveiled.



Google Home is voice controlled and can be used to manage and control other

smart appliances, as well as using artificial intelligence to answer questions.
