Retailer in Australia to start sale of Google Pixel and Pixel XL



If you live in Sydney, Australia and cant wait to get your hands on Google's

latest Pixel or Pixel XL, you could be lucky to be the first one to actually do

so.



The Telstra store on George Street, will be the first store to have the honor of

selling the Pixel and Pixel XL devices, starting at 8am local time on Thursday

October 20th. The phones have been available for pre order for a while,

especially from Google, Telstra and other online portals. However, some lucky

Telstra buyers have already received their phone, due to an early shipping

mistake from the carrier. However, pre orders can take weeks to ship and going

to retail stores instead will definitely be faster.



More retailers will start sale of the Pixel phones on Thursday as well, in their

respective time zones, including Verizon Wireless in the US. Have you already

pre ordered online or will you be going into the store to get one yourself? Let

us know in the comments below.
