According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Embodiments of the disclosure describe a tileable display panel including a

screen layer to display a unified image, an illumination layer including a

two-dimensional array of lamps, and a display layer disposed between the screen

layer and illumination layer. The display layer includes a plurality of pixelets

each positioned to be illuminated by a corresponding lamp from the illumination

layer to project a magnified image sub-portion corresponding to a received

subset. The magnified image sub-portions collectively blend together to form the

unified image displayed on the screen layer. Embodiments of the disclosure

further include illumination layer control logic to determine a brightness value

of each of the received subsets of pixel data, and adjust an illumination

setting to reduce or increase an illumination output of a lamp in the

illumination layer based, at least on part, on the brightness values of the

corresponding subset of pixel data."
