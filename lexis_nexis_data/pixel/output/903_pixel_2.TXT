According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Embodiments of the disclosure describe a tileable display panel including a
screen layer to display a unified image, an illumination layer including a
two-dimensional array of lamps, and a display layer disposed between the screen
layer and illumination layer. The display layer includes a plurality of pixelets
each positioned to be illuminated by a corresponding lamp from the illumination
layer to project a magnified image sub-portion corresponding to a received
subset. The magnified image sub-portions collectively blend together to form the
unified image displayed on the screen layer. Embodiments of the disclosure
further include illumination layer control logic to determine a brightness value
of each of the received subsets of pixel data, and adjust an illumination
setting to reduce or increase an illumination output of a lamp in the
illumination layer based, at least on part, on the brightness values of the
corresponding subset of pixel data."
