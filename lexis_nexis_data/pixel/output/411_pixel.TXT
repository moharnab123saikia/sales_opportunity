Google Pixel devices facing car Bluetooth issues



LENGTH: 176  words





Looks like Google's latest might be having connectivity issues



Google Pixel owners are reportedly experiencing connectivity issues with the

Bluetooth system in a number of vehicles.



According to recent reports, the new flagships are facing trouble pairing with

and staying connected to in-car Bluetooth. However, it is still not confirmed if

this is a Pixel issue, or an Android OS issue. On the Pixel support community

page however, multiple users have mentioned that they can connect to the car

Bluetooth, but it will randomly disconnect later. Meanwhile, other users claim

that Bluetooth is fully functional in some circumstances, like music playback,

but that calls cause a disconnect.



There are also reports of a similar issue popping up with Nexus devices that are

running the Android 7.1 preview, leading to the possibility that the problem may

be due to the latest Android software, as opposed to devices. Google is on the

case and is currently reaching out to those who have the same issue.
