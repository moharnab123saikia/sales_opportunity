According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Methods, systems and computer program products for automatic color correction
of image and video content are provided. A computer-implemented method may
include generating an auto-level linear transform and a histogram equalization
transform of a color distribution histogram for an original image among a set of
sequential images. The auto-level linear transform and the histogram
equalization transform are blended to create a modified image. Pixel color is
adjusted in the modified image so that a color difference between a pixel and
neighboring pixels in the modified image corresponds to a color difference
between respective pixels in the original image."

The patent was filed on October 19, 2012 Application no. 13/656,550
