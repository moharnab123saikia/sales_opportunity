Amazon to offer a tablet with better than iPad resolution: report



SECTION: TECHNOLOGY



LENGTH: 408 words





Reports suggest that Amazon is set to refresh its entire tablet range with

higher resolution alternatives and that they could be on sale by September.



Amazon's range of Kindle Fire tablets may be some of the only tablets that are

holding their own against the iPad in terms of sales and web use -- but as both

Apple and Google gear up to unveil new, refreshed tablets lines later this year,

Amazon will need to follow suit if it is expected to stay in touch with its

closest rivals.



According to BGR, the company is planning a full range refresh which will bring

resolution levels currently only seen on the full-sized iPad and Google's

Nexus-10 slate to some of its models.



The report claims that Amazon intends to keep a three-model lineup: a Kindle

Fire (7-inch screen); plus 7-inch and 8.9-inch variants of the Kindle Fire HD

tablets.



The entry-level and until now standard-definition model will see its pixel

density increased to a decidedly more HD 1280x800.



The 7-inch Kindle Fire HD will see its resolution upped to 1920x1200, while its

larger, 8.9-inch brother will get a 2560x1600 pixel screen taking it past the

current fourth generation Retina display iPad in terms of pixel numbers and

pixel density.



As well as reworked displays, the new devices are expected to be lighter and

have a more 'chiselled' appearance, a move away from the current trounded corner

look.



Amazon's Kindles are by no means the best tablets on the market and as Ars

Technica points out, the forked version of Android that the devices use as an

operating system is still wanting in terms of responsiveness and smoothness.



However, they remain very popular because of Amazon's competitive pricing and

the number of apps and multimedia content the company offers Kindle users. The

increased resolution will not only help the tablets stay up to date in the eyes

of US and European consumers but will also help them to win a greater market

share in countries that use character-based languages, such as China, Japan and

India.



At a 300 dots per inch resolution, text based on the Roman alphabet would look

smooth, crisp and clear to even those with the keenest of eyesight. However, a

greater pixel density is needed to achieve the same effect for text written in

Mandarin or Hindi.



If the report is to be believed, and BGR's Amazon sources have an excellent

track record, then expect the new devices to debut in September for the same

prices as the tablets they will be replacing.
