Chennai, Oct. 3 -- Nexus 6P (5.7-inch display)


The Nexus 6P continues the not very successful legacy of last year's
big-screened Nexus 6. It is the first Nexus device that came out as a
collaboration between Google and the Chinese phone maker Huawei. It is also
Google's first all-metal phone with a body made from anodised aluminium and the
first Nexus phone to get a finger print sensor. But unlike its predecessor,
which had a massive 6-inch display, the 6P has a 5.7-inch WQHD AMOLED display.
At 7.3mm, the phone is thin. The front has a 6 MP camera for selfies. The top of
the back houses a 12.3 MP Sony sensor combined with two-tone flash and laser
auto-focus. Below the black bar is the round fingerprint sensor which acts just
like the one on the iPhone; it logs into the phone, acts as a password for
purchases from Google Play store and can be used with Android Pay to make
payments at shops. With a USB-C port that enables fast charging and available in
frost white, graphite black and aluminium colours, the Nexus 6P runs the latest
Android 6.0 Marshmallow and will be available in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB
configurations, which will cost $499, $549 and $649 respectively.


Nexus 5X (5.2-inch display)

The Nexus 5, Google's last Nexus phone made in collaboration with LG, has been
one of the most loved phones that Google has ever made. Two years later, the 5
gets a sequel, Nexus 5X. On the front is a 5.2-inch screen with a 1080p display
and a 5-megapixel selfie camera protected by sturdy Gorilla Glass 3. On the
back, a slight bump is taken by the same 12.3-megapixel camera that is found on
the 6P, albeit with laser auto focus so you can take super sharp photos in any
light conditions. Below the camera is a finger print sensor carrying the same
Nexus Imprint technology from Google like the 6P. It can also be used for
logging into the phone and for making purchases on Google Play & Android Pay.
The sturdy phone is thin and lightweight at just 126 grams. It will be available
in Carbon Black, Quartz White and Ice Blue colours. Just like the 6P, it will
also come with a reversible USB C port so you can charge the phone in no time.
Running the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Nexus 5X will come in 16GB and
32GB configurations which will set you back by $379 and $429 respectively.

Pixel C

First came the Microsoft Surface. Then the iPad Pro. Now comes the Pixel C.
Pixel C borrows its name from Google's Chromebook Pixel along with its beautiful
brushed metal body. But instead of the Chrome OS that runs on Google's laptops,
the Pixel C runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The 10.2-inch tablet comes with a USB
C port and packs 3GB of RAM. While its price starts at $499, it is not complete
without the full-sized keyboard ($149). The tablet attaches to the keyboard
through Bluetooth and a magnetic connection. This also allows the docked tablet
to be positioned at any angle from 100 to 135 degrees. The keyboard does not
need to be charged as the tablet inductively charges the keyboard. Pixel C will
be available later this year.

Chromecast and Chromecast Audio

The Chromecast has been Google's way of letting us move our content from our
phones to TV screens. At $35, the first generation Chromecast was cheap and sold
20 million devices. With Chromecast 2.0, Google is ready to give us an upgraded
experience. The streaming stick is a puck with a very flexible HDMI cable that
you can plug into your TV. It packs three antennas and comes with latest Wi-Fi
streaming standards so the experience of streaming from your Android or iPhone
to your HDTV is super smooth. One of the main features of the Chromecast app is
'What's On'; it shows the top content from all streaming apps installed on your
phone. There is also a Chromecast Audio dongle which comes with a 3.5mm jack
that can be plugged into any speaker. Chromecast and the Chromecast Audio are
for $35.
