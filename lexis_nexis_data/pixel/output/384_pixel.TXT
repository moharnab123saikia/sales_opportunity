Chennai, Oct. 3 -- Nexus 6P (5.7-inch display)





The Nexus 6P continues the not very successful legacy of last year's

big-screened Nexus 6. It is the first Nexus device that came out as a

collaboration between Google and the Chinese phone maker Huawei. It is also

Google's first all-metal phone with a body made from anodised aluminium and the

first Nexus phone to get a finger print sensor. But unlike its predecessor,

which had a massive 6-inch display, the 6P has a 5.7-inch WQHD AMOLED display.

At 7.3mm, the phone is thin. The front has a 6 MP camera for selfies. The top of

the back houses a 12.3 MP Sony sensor combined with two-tone flash and laser

auto-focus. Below the black bar is the round fingerprint sensor which acts just

like the one on the iPhone; it logs into the phone, acts as a password for

purchases from Google Play store and can be used with Android Pay to make

payments at shops. With a USB-C port that enables fast charging and available in

frost white, graphite black and aluminium colours, the Nexus 6P runs the latest

Android 6.0 Marshmallow and will be available in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB

configurations, which will cost $499, $549 and $649 respectively.





Nexus 5X (5.2-inch display)



The Nexus 5, Google's last Nexus phone made in collaboration with LG, has been

one of the most loved phones that Google has ever made. Two years later, the 5

gets a sequel, Nexus 5X. On the front is a 5.2-inch screen with a 1080p display

and a 5-megapixel selfie camera protected by sturdy Gorilla Glass 3. On the

back, a slight bump is taken by the same 12.3-megapixel camera that is found on

the 6P, albeit with laser auto focus so you can take super sharp photos in any

light conditions. Below the camera is a finger print sensor carrying the same

Nexus Imprint technology from Google like the 6P. It can also be used for

logging into the phone and for making purchases on Google Play & Android Pay.

The sturdy phone is thin and lightweight at just 126 grams. It will be available

in Carbon Black, Quartz White and Ice Blue colours. Just like the 6P, it will

also come with a reversible USB C port so you can charge the phone in no time.

Running the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the Nexus 5X will come in 16GB and

32GB configurations which will set you back by $379 and $429 respectively.



Pixel C



First came the Microsoft Surface. Then the iPad Pro. Now comes the Pixel C.

Pixel C borrows its name from Google's Chromebook Pixel along with its beautiful

brushed metal body. But instead of the Chrome OS that runs on Google's laptops,

the Pixel C runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The 10.2-inch tablet comes with a USB

C port and packs 3GB of RAM. While its price starts at $499, it is not complete

without the full-sized keyboard ($149). The tablet attaches to the keyboard

through Bluetooth and a magnetic connection. This also allows the docked tablet

to be positioned at any angle from 100 to 135 degrees. The keyboard does not

need to be charged as the tablet inductively charges the keyboard. Pixel C will

be available later this year.



Chromecast and Chromecast Audio



The Chromecast has been Google's way of letting us move our content from our

phones to TV screens. At $35, the first generation Chromecast was cheap and sold

20 million devices. With Chromecast 2.0, Google is ready to give us an upgraded

experience. The streaming stick is a puck with a very flexible HDMI cable that

you can plug into your TV. It packs three antennas and comes with latest Wi-Fi

streaming standards so the experience of streaming from your Android or iPhone

to your HDTV is super smooth. One of the main features of the Chromecast app is

'What's On'; it shows the top content from all streaming apps installed on your

phone. There is also a Chromecast Audio dongle which comes with a 3.5mm jack

that can be plugged into any speaker. Chromecast and the Chromecast Audio are

for $35.
