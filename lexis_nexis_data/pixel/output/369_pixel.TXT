giant Google has been working on it and has rolled out sharper and more seamless
imagery to the tools.The update includes photos from Landsat 8 designed by NASA
and the United States Geological Survey and "new processing techniques for
sharper images than ever before." Google claims that it is mining data from
nearly a petabyte of Landsat imagery.

To put that in perspective, 700 trillion pixels is 7,000 times more pixels than
the estimated number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, or 70 times more pixels
than the estimated number of galaxies in the Universe."To produce this new
imagery, we used the same publicly available Earth Engine APIs that scientists
use to do things like track global tree cover, loss, and gain; predict Malaria
outbreaks; and map global surface water over a 30 year period," wrote the
company in a blogpost.According to Google, the satellite images are often
cloudy, but not always over the same place, so the company looked at millions of
images and took the clearest pixels to stitch together a cloud-free and seamless
image.The blog further reveals that the company in its previous mosaic used
imagery from Landsat 7 only, which at the time was the best imagery of its kind.
Unfortunately, Landsat 7 images captured after 2003 were affected by a hardware
failure, resulting in large diagonal gaps of missing data Recently, the Home
Ministry has rejected Google's Street View plan, under which the company plans
to cover India via its SteetView service.Citing security concerns the ministry
said that enabling such image capture techniques led to the planning of 2008
terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The officials further said that the rejection came
after a detailed analysis by the defence and security agencies. The security
agencies believe that allowing Google to cover India may compromise the security
of the country.
