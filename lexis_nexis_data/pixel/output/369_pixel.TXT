NEW DELHI: Finding Google Maps, Google Earth apps prettier? Yes, the search

giant Google has been working on it and has rolled out sharper and more seamless

imagery to the tools.The update includes photos from Landsat 8 designed by NASA

and the United States Geological Survey and "new processing techniques for

sharper images than ever before." Google claims that it is mining data from

nearly a petabyte of Landsat imagery.



To put that in perspective, 700 trillion pixels is 7,000 times more pixels than

the estimated number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, or 70 times more pixels

than the estimated number of galaxies in the Universe."To produce this new

imagery, we used the same publicly available Earth Engine APIs that scientists

use to do things like track global tree cover, loss, and gain; predict Malaria

outbreaks; and map global surface water over a 30 year period," wrote the

company in a blogpost.According to Google, the satellite images are often

cloudy, but not always over the same place, so the company looked at millions of

images and took the clearest pixels to stitch together a cloud-free and seamless

image.The blog further reveals that the company in its previous mosaic used

imagery from Landsat 7 only, which at the time was the best imagery of its kind.

Unfortunately, Landsat 7 images captured after 2003 were affected by a hardware

failure, resulting in large diagonal gaps of missing data Recently, the Home

Ministry has rejected Google's Street View plan, under which the company plans

to cover India via its SteetView service.Citing security concerns the ministry

said that enabling such image capture techniques led to the planning of 2008

terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The officials further said that the rejection came

after a detailed analysis by the defence and security agencies. The security

agencies believe that allowing Google to cover India may compromise the security

of the country.
