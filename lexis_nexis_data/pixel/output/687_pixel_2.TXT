United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patent no. 8,891,626, on
November 18, 2014, to Google Inc. (California), titled as "Center of motion for
encoding motion fields"

Inventors: Bankoski; James (Wynantskill, NY), Wilkins; Paul (Cambridge, GB)
Assignee: Google Inc. (Mountain View, CA)

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
system and method for encoding and decoding a video is disclosed having a
plurality of frames with spatially correspondent blocks comprised of pixels. The
encoding method includes determining a motion field for a plurality of pixels in
a first frame having a same direction of movement as each other, the motion
field having a center of motion, at least one dimension defining a shape of the
motion field and a motion vector, encoding the motion field into a bitstream,
associating at least one block of the first frame with the motion field and
encoding each block associated with the motion field into the bitstream without
a separate motion vector. Motion fields can be reused across multiple frames,
decreasing the number of bits spent to encode motion vectors."

The patent was filed on April 5, 2011 Application no. 13/080,266
