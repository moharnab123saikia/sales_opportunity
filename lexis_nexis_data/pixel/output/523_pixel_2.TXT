Google is expected to unveil a new virtual reality headset October 4, 2016, due

on sale shortly afterwards, reports the specialist website Cnet.



The headset, which could be called the "Daydream View," will accompany the

launch of Google's Android-powered VR platform, announced in the springtime at

the Google I/O conference. It's expected to work in conjunction with a

smartphone, probably Google's own handsets first of all. Cnet also reports that

the headset is being built by HTC and that it's due on sale soon after its

unveiling, probably October 20 in the USA.



The device could allow wearers to explore augmented reality environments, in a

similar fashion to Microsoft's Hololens glasses, currently available to

developers. For that, Google can count on Magic Leap, a startup in which the

Mountain View, California tech giant has already invested heavily. The firm is

known to be developing spectacular augmented reality solutions that bring

virtual content to real-world environments, any time, any place.



Tough competition



Google's new headset will be a direct rival for the HTC Vive, currently on sale

for $799, as well as the Oculus Rift, out now priced $599. The Sony PlayStation

VR is also set to land October 13, for just $399.



Google already offers a rudimentary virtual reality viewer that goes by the name

of Cardboard. Users simply load a smartphone running YouTube and compatible

applications into a build-it-yourself cardboard viewer. It sells for $15 and is

compatible with most Android and iOS handsets with 4" to 6" screens.



Ahead of news on the headset and compatible smartphones, Google has already

opened its virtual reality platform up to developers with a first "VR SDK" kit,

still in beta.



A new smartphone and a hybrid PC in the pipeline



The October 4 conference is likely to see Google unveil a new smartphone line

under its own brand name, replacing the Nexus range built in collaboration with

third-party manufacturers. The handsets could be named "Pixel," following

Google's Pixel C tablet and the Chromebook Pixel. The event could also see

Google hit hard in the PC market with a high-end hybrid laptop.
