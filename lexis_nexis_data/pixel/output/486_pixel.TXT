Google Nexus 7



Faster, lighter and thinner is a mantra Google's engineers obviously had at the

front of their minds when it came to updating the Nexus 7. The design has been

slimmed down but processor speed, screen resolution and memory have all been

boosted in an attempt to stay one step ahead. Google claims the new device has a

class-leading 192200 pixel screen with a pixel density of 323 pixels per inch.

Battery life is another area to benefit with up to 10 hours of uninterrupted

browsing. It has a 5-megapixel rear camera for taking photographs and

1.2-megapixel one on the front for video calls. The wi-fi only version is

expected to launch later this year with a 4G model following soon after. Buyers

will be able to choose between 16GB ((EURO)230 estimated) or the 32GB and 32GB

((EURO)270 estimated) memory.

Sony SRS-BTX500 Bluetooth speaker



Word of warning if you are thinking of purchasing Sony's latest Bluetooth

speaker - - don't settle down to dinner with the volume turned up full if you

are of a nervous disposition. Pairing this device to your Bluetoothenabled

gadgets is a simple one-button process, so it's easy to forget your phone could

blurt into life at ear-drum shattering volumes. When it's playing music rather

than scaring the life out of people, Sony's 40-watt unit sounds impressive.

Decent bass and clarity as well as exceptional build quality make this one of

the most desirable wireless speakers around. It weighs in at around 2kg and the

battery lasts up to six hours between charges.

ACTION STATIONS



****************



Garmin VIRB and VIRB Elite



GoPro's hold on the action camera market is under threat. Garmin has been making

GPS devices since the late 1980s but some recent models incorporate cameras. The

VIRB and VIRB Elite shoot three hours of 1080p highdefinition footage and

include image stabilisation, lens distortion correction and time-lapse slow

motion. They feature an ambient-lit, 1.4-inch colour screen that lets users

frame shots and review footage. Waterproof to one metre, they can also be fitted

to a range of mounts that attach to helmets, handlebars or boards. The Elite

model comes with wi-fi, GPS, an accelerometer and altimeter.
