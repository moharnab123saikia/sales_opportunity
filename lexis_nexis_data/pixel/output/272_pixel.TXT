Google has shared over 100 camera samples, clicked on the Pixel and Pixel XL

smartphones.



At the Pixel smartphone event, Google touted the new device's camera as "the

best smartphone camera ever". To back up this claim, the company has released a

slew of images clicked by camera lead Isaac Reynolds, clicked by the Pixel or

the Pixel XL.



Photos highlight the camera's strength, in a variety of settings including macro

shots, low light photos, and even aerial pictures from a drone, pointed out

Phandroid. However, the report pointed out that at least half of these photos

were processed with Snapseed and VSCO.



Lastly, the EXIF data revealed that the images were indeed, taken on Google's

new smartphones.
