Nexus phones might get Pixel's fingerprint gestures



LENGTH: 182  words





Pixel's fingerprint gestures might just make it to last year's Nexus devices



Google Nexus 6P and 5X owners might be getting access to the new fingerprint

gesture feature found on Google's new Pixel phone, thanks to a new report.



According to reports, a Google spokesperson has stated the company is

"evaluating" plans to release a future firmware update to the 6P and 5X that

would add support for fingerprint scanner gestures. This news follows a

statement from Google team member Ian Lake who mentioned that the feature might

soon come to Nexus devices. He had stated earlier that the 6P and the 5X wont

get the features due to missing hardware, but he stated today that it might a

matter of firmware so an update might be the solution.



However, these reports are not solid, as Google hasnt given any timeline for

when the update would be released or if it will be released at all. Simply put,

Nexus users are advised not to keep hopes high, however, the statement does

indicate that Google is listening to feedback from Nexus users.
