News



LENGTH: 198  words





Rumors about a higher-end Google Chromebook were floating around the web these

past few days and today we get the official word from Google. The Chromebook

pixel is very real and available right now- although at a price level that

doesn't make sense.Â    The Acer and Samsung Chromebooks cost $199 and $249 (AED

730 and 915) which makes the $1300 or AED 4775 figure of Chrome Pixel a bit hard

to swallow. Yes, it has much better specs and people spend that much on Windows

or Mac laptops but that's because you already have a full suite of applications

available for these platforms. The Google Chrome OS is still very much in its

infancy stage.    [embedded content]     The hardware is configuration is nice

with an Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB or RAM and 64/128GB of SSD storage. What is

definitely worth lusting after is the 12.85" touchscreen with an insanely high

resolution of 2560 x 1700 which gives it a PPI of 239 which is a bit higher that

the 13" MacBook Pro with a 227 ppi. A model equipped with LTE will also be

coming up in the next couple of months with a price tag of $1450. Google is

justifying the price by providing the buyer with 1TB of cloud storage free for

three years.
