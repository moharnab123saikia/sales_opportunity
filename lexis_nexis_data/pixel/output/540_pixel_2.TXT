past few days and today we get the official word from Google. The Chromebook
pixel is very real and available right now- although at a price level that
doesn't make sense.    The Acer and Samsung Chromebooks cost $199 and $249 (AED
730 and 915) which makes the $1300 or AED 4775 figure of Chrome Pixel a bit hard
to swallow. Yes, it has much better specs and people spend that much on Windows
or Mac laptops but that's because you already have a full suite of applications
available for these platforms. The Google Chrome OS is still very much in its
infancy stage.    [embedded content]     The hardware is configuration is nice
with an Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB or RAM and 64/128GB of SSD storage. What is
definitely worth lusting after is the 12.85" touchscreen with an insanely high
resolution of 2560 x 1700 which gives it a PPI of 239 which is a bit higher that
the 13" MacBook Pro with a 227 ppi. A model equipped with LTE will also be
coming up in the next couple of months with a price tag of $1450. Google is
justifying the price by providing the buyer with 1TB of cloud storage free for
three years.
