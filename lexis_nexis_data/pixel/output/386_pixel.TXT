It looks like a good news is out for the owners of the Lava Pixel V1 smartphone

in India.



While we know the smartphone is part of Google's Android One program, the good

news what we are talking about is pretty much an easy guess work.



Lava Pixel V1 has started receiving Android 6.0 Marshmallow update in India and

this time it looks like Google has been pretty fast in rolling out the latest

update for the Android One devices unlike before.



With this new update, Lava Pixel V1 now gets features like Doze, app

permissions, Google Now on Tap and Flex storage, to name a few.



Adding more, the Doze and App Standby are useful for improving the battery life.



To recall, the Lava Pixel V1 comes with a 5.5 inch display, 2 GB RAM, MediaTek

1.3 GHz quad core processor and 32 GB internal memory.



The update is reportedly around 621 MB in size and Lava Pixel V1 owners will be

receiving notifications on their smartphone.



It is also recommended that users require at least 750 MB of free storage to

successfully install the Android 6.0 Marshmallow updates.
