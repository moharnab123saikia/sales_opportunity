The company recently announced via Twitter that the smartphones would reach

stores on Oct 25.



The much awaited Google Pixel smartphones have recently been launched in India

and have, ever since then been open for pre-orders through popular retailers and

e-commerce portals like Flipkart, Reliance Digital, and Chroma, among others.

However, no clue was given about its availability for purchase over the shelves,

and users have been waiting for an announcement ever since the Indian launch of

both the smartphones.



But, now, the wait is over. Google India has recently tweeted that Pixel

smartphone will be reaching stores on Oct 25 with a hashtag #madebygoogle.

Considering this, it is after 21 days since its launch that the Search Engine

Giant has finally decided to bring the devices in to shelves.



However, for many surprising minds, the news that Pixel smartphones' Really Blue

collar variant won't be coming in to the Indian market comes in as a sad

announcement, though the Quite Black and Very Silver would be available for

shipment starting Tuesday, Oct 25.



Speaking about the price tags of the Pixel smartphones, we can purchase the 32

GB variant at INR 57,000 while the Pixel XL 32 GB comes in a INR 67,000. And,

the 128 GB variants of both Pixel and Pixel XL are priced at INR 66,000 and INR

76,000 respectively.



Technical speaking, both these variants are almost similar to each other, except

a few differences, mainly being the display size. While Pixel comes with a 5

inch FHD display, the Pixel XL comes with a 5.5 inch QHD display. Also, the

Pixel packs a 2,770 mAh battery and the XL variant sports a 3,450 mAh battery.

Rest other specs including 4 GB RAM, Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor,

Fingerprint Sensor, 12.3 MP rear camera, and 8 MP front camera remain the same.
