October 4!

Google has sent out invites for an event on October 4 in San Francisco, where it
is expected to unveil its new phone line - Pixel. The devices will most likely
run Android Nougat. Additionally, Google may unveil Google Home, Daydream VR and
a Chromecast capable of 4K playback.

Google has unveiled a teaser page which offers a "Keep me updated about devices
from Google" along with a video posted to its YouTube channel.

While we've seen a few leaks regarding both phones' specifications, this time
around, the rumours talk about the OS inside. A leaked benchmark test on
Geekbench indicates both the upcoming PIxel and Pixel XL smartphones will ship
with Android 7.1 Nougat. In addition, the Google Pixel will feature a 1.6GHz
quad-core Snapdragon processor (likely the Snapdragon 820) with 4GB RAM.

In other leaks, Phone Arena spotted possible renders for the Pixel and Pixel XL,
while Android Headlines, came across TPU cases available on AliExpress. Assuming
the designs on both are correct, it appears the Pixel XL will sport a
fingerprint scanner on the rear panel, similar to the Nexus 5X and 6P, The Pixel
will sport a 5-inch display, while the Pixel XL has a 5.5-inch display.

Also set for the event are Google Home, a voice-controlled smart home assistant
which debuted at Google I/O in May, a Chromecast media streaming device that
will support 4K ultra HD resolution, and a personal viewer device for its
Daydream VR program (also announced at Google I/O.)
