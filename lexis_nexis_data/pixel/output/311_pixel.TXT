What is it? The future of laptops, I believe, but until I get to that bit, it's

Google's first proper computer. For two years, the search giant has partnered

with Samsung and others to produce cheap little Chromebooks. Essentially web

browsers with keyboards, they do away with software, hard drives and sluggish

start-up times. You do everything online and store your stuff in the cloud,

where it's safe and accessible anywhere.



The Pixel does this, too, but for the first time Google has created the

hardware. The result is a device of startling beauty. Machined aluminium with

sharp corners make it boxy yet also elegant enough to make my Mac-Book look

brutish. The black, backlit keyboard is Macinspired but the search key in place

of caps lock (hit both shift keys if you really want to SHOUT) is one of few

marks of the maker. The design brief appears to have been: make it beautiful but

let the screen do the talking. And what a screen. It boasts a record-breaking

pixel density, and it shows, rendering everything as crisp as any Retina

Display. You can touch it, too, to click, scroll or pinch to zoom, a feature

still absent from MacBooks.



Does it work? Like a dream. The Pixel fires up in an instant and asks for your

Google Account details, which you won't need to enter again. The Chrome browser

appears. Hook it up to the web and you're off. It's lightning fast and scrolling

is beautifully smooth via the screen or the etched-glass touchpad.



The Pixel is also effectively impervious to viruses and includes 32GB of

physical storage, plus a massive terabyte (about 1,000GB) of space on the Google

Drive cloud (included for three years; you'd pay £30 a month to rent that space

from Google otherwise).



I need one now, right? Wrong. Because, for now, there are issues. You can't

install software. No iTunes, Spotify, Microsoft Office. If you can't do it via a

web browser, you can't do it on a Chromebook. The battery life is low at five

hours; the machine is of limited use offline and has no 4G connectivity (the US

model does); the screen doesn't fold flat to a tablet mode.



But the biggest deal-breaker? A Pixel will cost you £1,049, enough for five Acer

or four Samsung Chromebooks, and £200 more than an 11in MacBook Air, which

supports software, is lighter, has double the storage, and a slightly better

battery life.



The Pixel is a bold statement of intent. When Google can produce a cheaper

model, when services such as Spotify and iTunes switch to the cloud, and when it

has 4G, this is what laptops will look like. It won't be long, and I can't wait.
