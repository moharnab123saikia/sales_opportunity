smartphone market with the launch of the Google Pixel. Google has achieved
something that no other device-maker, bar Apple, has-an integration of devices
and software to build a strong ecosystem. Pixel competes head-to-head with the
iPhone on all parameters, be it OS, app stores, cloud storage, online assistance
and even price. Google also gains from the fact that Pixel was launched at a
time when the largest-selling Android device-maker Samsung was in trouble over
exploding Galaxy Note 7.

While other device-makers opted for the Android OS-since the iOS is a walled
garden-for Pixel, it is part of Google. It also has the Play Store to compete
with Apple's App Store; while Apple offers storage on the iCloud, Google is
offering Pixel users unlimited cloud storage for full-resolution photos and
video. As far as voice-activated assistants go in an AI world-it is a fight
between Apple's Siri and the Google Assistant. But, the advantage that Google
has is that it can, over time, tie-in the various ventures under Alphabet. That
includes the connected home device-Google Home, driverless cars and Nest. iPhone
sales that have been on a down-trend-from 51 million in Q2 2016 to 40.4 million
in Q3 2016-could have gained traction with the launch of the iPhone 7. But, the
Pixel could just be the beginning of the biggest competition to Apple.
