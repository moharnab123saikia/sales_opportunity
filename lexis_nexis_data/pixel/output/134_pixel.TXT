SAN FRANCISCO



Google launched an aggressive challenge to consumer electronics giants like

Apple and Samsung on Tuesday, introducing a new line of smartphones called Pixel

and other gadgets designed to showcase a digital helper the company calls "

Google Assistant."



The new devices represent a big push by Google to make and sell its own

hardware, instead of largely just supplying software for other manufacturers. At

a starting price of roughly US$650, the new Pixel phones are aimed at the same

markets as Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy flagship phones.



GADGETS ON PARADE



During a media event Tuesday, Google executives showed offa series of gadgets in

rapid succession. Google's new Home device is a sleek Internet-connected speaker

that's designed to respond to voice commands, like Amazon's popular Echo. A new

virtual reality headset called Daydream View will work with the new Pixel phones

and other Android devices. Also unveiled were a new Wi-Fi router and an update

to the company's Chromecast streaming media device.



In announcing the new Pixel phones, Google executives touted features like a

powerful camera, a long-lasting battery - and a dedicated headphone jack, which

Apple recently eliminated from its latest iPhones.



The Pixel phones will be sold in two screen sizes - five inches and 5.5 inches -

and three colours: black, silver and blue.



But they're clearly hoping that the new Pixel phones will be distinguished by

their use of Google's software.



A central element of all the new devices is the Google Assistant, which uses

artificial intelligence to deliver what CEO Sundar Pichai described as "a

personal Google for each and every user."



Google, which is best known for its widely used Internet search engine, makes

most of its money from online software and digital ads. But it's putting more

emphasis on hardware as it competes for consumers' attention with other leading

tech firms.



HARDWARE IS HARD



New devices could help Google keep its services front and centre in the battle

for consumers' attention, said analyst Julie Ask at Forrester Research.



Unlike a new mobile app or other software, she noted, it can be an expensive

gamble to build and ship new hardware products. "But if you're Google, you can't

afford to stop placing bets."



Google has sold smartphones and tablets under the Nexus brand, which it launched

in 2010 as a way to show offthe best features of its Android software. But it

put relatively little effort into promoting those devices, which have mostly

ended up in the hands of Google purists.



Android already powers the majority of smartphones sold around the world. But

Samsung, the biggest maker of Android phones, has increasingly been adding more

of its own software - even its own Samsung Pay mobile wallet - on the phones it

sells. Another big rival, Apple, has built its own services, such as online maps

and its own Siri personal assistant, to replace Google's apps on the iPhone.



Google will sell its Pixel phones online, through retail chains like Best Buy

and various wireless carriers around the world, although the company said it has

an exclusive deal with Verizon in the United States.



HOME, BUT NOT ALONE



Like the Pixel phones, the "Home" device uses Google's digital "Assistant"

service, a voice-activated personal butler that can search the Internet, play

music or perform other useful tasks.



"Assistant" is the company's answer to similar concierge services from rivals,

including Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. Google said the Home

device will sell for US$130 online and at electronics retailers starting next

month.



Leading tech companies are all competing to assist consumers in their online

activities, from search and navigation to shopping. That gives the companies a

better chance of selling advertising or other services.



Home-based systems like the Echo are taking on more importance as voice

technology has improved, said Forrester's Ask. "You can't assume somebody is

going to go sit down at a computer or pick up a phone and type in a question

anymore," she said. !@COPYRIGHT=Â© 2016 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights
