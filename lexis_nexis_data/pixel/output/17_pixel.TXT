Google Pixel and Pixel XL: UK release date, price, specs and features of

Google's new Android smartphones;

Google Nexus is dead - long live Google Pixel. Here's everything you need to

know about Google's new iPhone 7 rivals

Google has revealed two new phones that will offer an alternative to Apple's

popular iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.



The search giant has been producing its own Android-based phones for the last

few years under the "Nexus" brand - but no more.



Google has ditched the name Nexus in favour of the Pixel moniker. In the past,

the company has used the Pixel name on its premium tablet and laptop products.



Google Duo video-calling app for Android and iOS takes aim at FaceTime and Skype



The new Pixel is, in Google's words, "the first phone built by Google inside and

out".



Just like Apple, Google controlled both the hardware and the software - in this

case, Android version 7 (nicknamed Nougat).



Google Pixel launch LIVE: Pixel smartphones, Google Home speaker and Daydream VR

expected at October 4 event



Pre-orders for the phone began on October 4 in the US, UK, Australia, Germany

and Canada.



The phone will ship to customers and be available in shops on October 20.

Pre-orders for the Pixel and Pixel XL are both open either through Google's own

online store (which you can find here) or high street store Carphone Warehouse

(which is here).



Alternatively, you can go to the network EE, which has an exclusive right to the

Pixel phone in the UK.



With EE, the Pixel is free on a £50.99 a month, 24 month 4GEE plan, which comes

with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month for

existing customers.



The Pixel XL is also available free on a £55.99 a month, 24 month plan, and

comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month

for existing customers.



4GEE Plan customers receive unlimited minutes, texts and 500MB of data a month

for use abroad in the EU. Alternatively, for just £5 per month more, you can get

Pixel and Pixel XL on 4GEE Max plans giving you access to the UK's fastest 4G

speeds, and inclusive access to the BT Sport App for the duration of the plan.



Just as an extra sweetener, those who pre-order before October 20th will receive

a £50 Google Play voucher they can use to purchase content from the Google Play

store.



The white Pixel bears a striking resemblance to the iPhone 6 although it has the

rear-mounted fingerprint scanner popular with other Android handsets.



Both the smaller Pixel and the larger Pixel XL will make the jump to the USB-C

charging port and both will have 4GB of RAM and the same 12MP camera on the back

(8MP on the front).



There will be a choice of either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and Google

is also offering Pixel owners free unlimited storage for photos and videos

through its Google Photos app.



And - of course - Google has kept the 3.5mm headphone jack in place, unlike

Apple which ditched it with the launch of the iPhone 7.



What makes phone batteries explode? And what to do if YOU bought Samsung's

Galaxy Note 7



Both the Pixel and the XL have a similar design to last year's well-received

Nexus 6P albeit with a thinner bezel that means a near edge-to-edge display.



Buying directly from Google or Carphone Warehouse means you can pick up the

phones SIM-free and unlocked for the one-off price of £599 for the 5-inch Pixel

and £719 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL.



That puts them in exactly the same kind of territory as Apple's iPhone models.



It looks like EE is the only network in the UK that will stock the phone on

contract, and we'll update this as soon as we know for certain.



iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7: Which smartphone is best when Apple and Samsung go

toe-to-toe?



The Pixel XL has 5.5-inch 2,560 x 1,440 AMOLED display with a quad-core Qualcomm

processor, 4GB of RAM, USB Type-C port, and rear-facing fingerprint reade.



It has a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 8-megapixel front-facing one.



It will also have a beefy 3,450mAh battery and standard 32GB of storage, with

the option to upgrade to a 128GB if needed.



Android 7.0 Nougat: All the features of Google's new mobile operating system and

how to download it onto your smartphone



The regular Pixel has similar specs, but it's clearly the lower-end of the two

flagships.



It will sport a 5-inch Full HD AMOLED display, quad-core 2.0GHz 64-bit

processor, 4GB of RAM, the same cameras as the XL and a smaller 2,770mAh

battery.



As expected, it will also come with a rear-mounted fingerprint reader and a USB

Type-C port.



Both Pixel phones come pre-installed with the latest version of Android

(Nougat), as well as Google's AI-powered assistant Allo and the FaceTime-style

app Duo.



Google also "live cases" that can be customised with your favorite photos and

places, as well as exclusive designs from artists like Justin Maller, and

photographers like Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield.



If you don't like the idea of an iPhone 7 there's a lot to suggest Google's

phones will offer a decent alternative. These phones will be developed to

Google's spec so should have the best integration with Android on the market.



What's more, they're going to be entirely free of the third-party bloatware

commonly loaded onto Android phones by other manufacturers.
