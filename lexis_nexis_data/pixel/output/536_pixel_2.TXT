NEW DELHI: Sony and Google have released the Google Play edition of the Sony

marry the tablet and smartphone form factors.



The Sony Xperia Z Ultra Google Play edition is available for purchase on the

Google Play Store only in the United States, at a $649 price tag. For the

uninitiated, Google Play editions feature Stock Android just like Google's Nexus

devices, stripping off the user interface customizations deployed by device

manufacturers.



The Sony Xperia Z Ultra Google Play edition is powered by a 2.2GHz Snapdragon

800 quad-core processor, along with an Adreno 330 GPU, and 2GB of RAM. The

device runs Android 4.4 KitKat, the latest iteration of Google's mobile

operating system.

announced the Google Play edition of its 8.3-inch Android tablet, the G Pad 8.3.

Android 4.4 KitKat.

front-facing camera.The Wi-Fi only device is available at a price point of

$349.99 on the Google Play Store in the United States. It's not clear if LG

intends to sell it outside of the US, at the moment.



In addition to the Google Play editions, Google has also taken the wraps off a

white colour variant of the Nexus 7 (2013) tablet. The variant is available only

in the US, UK and Japan, and is only available for the Wi-Fi only 32GB version

of the tablet, at the moment.

variants, and features 2GB RAM, a 7-inch screen with FullHD resolution(1920 X
