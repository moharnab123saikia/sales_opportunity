

With the unveiling of the iPad mini the battlefield is finally set for this
holiday season's tablet wars. The iPad mini sports a screen just under 8 inches
and a price of $329. Its opponents compete on price, performance and features.
Each offers something unique. So let's see how they stack up on paper. (We would
have liked to include the Kindle Fire HD, but it's currently only available in
the U.S.)

DISPLAY

Although the iPad mini boasts the largest display of the bunch at 7.9 inches,
its resolution falls short. The iPad mini has just a 1,024 by 768 pixel
resolution and a low pixels per inch density (PPI) of 163.

By comparison, the Nexus 7 has a 7-inch screen with 1,280 by 800 pixel
resolutions and 216 PPI. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 screen doesn't look as pretty
as the other displays and has the lowest resolution of the three: 1024 x 600.

WEIGHT

When it comes to weight, though, the iPad mini is easily the lightest of the
three. It weighs 0.68 pounds.

The Nexus 7 comes in at 0.75 pounds while the Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0 tops out the
bunch at 0.76 pounds.

THICKNESS

The iPad mini is also the thinnest of the mini tablets at just 7.2 millimetres,
or .28 inches, thick. The iPad mini by far beats the Samsung Galaxy 2 7.0, which
is 10.5 millimetres, or about .41 inches, thick, and the Nexus 7, which is
equivalent at 10.45 millimetres.

BATTERY

Apple says the iPad mini has the same 10-hour battery life that the 9.7-inch
iPad has.

Google's Nexus 7 has a battery life of 8 hours. Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 clocks
in at 7 hours.

CAMERA

With cameras, Apple is once again the clear winner. It shoots 5-megapixel photos
and records 1080p HD video.

The iPad mini also has a front-facing camera, which records 720p HD and shoots
1.2-megapixel photos. Google ties that mark with the Nexus 7.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 has a 3-megapixel camera with HD 720p video recording
capability.

CONNECTIVITY

All three tablets connect to Wi-Fi, but if you're looking for a small tablet
that can connect to cellular networks, your only choice is the iPad mini. But
LTE doesn't come cheap. The cellular-connected iPad mini starts at $459.

OPERATING SYSTEMS

All three tablets run on different operating systems. The iPad mini runs Apple's
iOS 6 and the Nexus 7 runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean while the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2
7.0 is powered by the Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich.

VARIATIONS AND PRICE

Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 delivers a mostly pure Android 4.0 experience for $250.
Nexus 7 has a better price ($199-$249) but has a lack of built-in expandable
storage. Apple is pricier, but you get more choices.

CHIPS

The iPad mini uses Apple's own A5 dual-core chip that also powers the iPhone 4S
smartphone. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 runs on a powerful 1GHz dual core processor
which gives you the freedom to multi-task without slowing down, while the Nexus
7 uses Nvidia's quad-core Tegra 3 processor.

CONCLUSION

The iPad mini is priced in a way to suggest it is a much superior device
compared to its rivals. But its specifications, at least, say otherwise.
