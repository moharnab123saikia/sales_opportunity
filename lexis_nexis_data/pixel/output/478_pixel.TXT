block using a processor and according to the following equation:
X.sub.ij=L.sub.i+A.sub.j-C; wherein X.sub.ij is the predicted value, L.sub.i is
the value of a pixel to the left of the current block, A.sub.j is the value of a
pixel in a row above the current block and C is the value of a pixel in the row
above and the column to the left of the current block and decoding the current
block using the predicted value."
