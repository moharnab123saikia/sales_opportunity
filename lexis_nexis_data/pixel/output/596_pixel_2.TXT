United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patent no. 9,049,454, on

June 02, 2015, to GOOGLE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS LLC (California), titled as "High

efficiency low complexity interpolation filters"

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Embodiments for high efficiency low complexity interpolation filters for High

Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) are disclosed herein, specifically novel

techniques for a video compression system. In order to estimate and compensate

sub-pel displacements, the image signal on these sub-pel positions is generated

by an interpolation process. In HEVC, sub-pel pixel interpolation is performed

using filters. As described herein, the filter may have, for example, eight taps

to determine the sub-pel pixel values for sub-pel pixel positions, such as

half-pel and quarter-pel positions. The taps weight the integer pixels with

coefficient values to generate the sub-pel signals. Different coefficients may

produce different compression performance in signal distortion and noise."



The patent was filed on. January 19, 2012 Application no. 13/354,201
