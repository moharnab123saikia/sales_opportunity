According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Embodiments for high efficiency low complexity interpolation filters for High
Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) are disclosed herein, specifically novel
techniques for a video compression system. In order to estimate and compensate
sub-pel displacements, the image signal on these sub-pel positions is generated
by an interpolation process. In HEVC, sub-pel pixel interpolation is performed
using filters. As described herein, the filter may have, for example, eight taps
to determine the sub-pel pixel values for sub-pel pixel positions, such as
half-pel and quarter-pel positions. The taps weight the integer pixels with
coefficient values to generate the sub-pel signals. Different coefficients may
produce different compression performance in signal distortion and noise."

The patent was filed on. January 19, 2012 Application no. 13/354,201
