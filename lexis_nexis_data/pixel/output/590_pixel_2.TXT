Explorers.

Tuesday, October 29, 2013: Google has reportedly announced that a new updated
version of the much talked about Google Glass is under development within the
company's walls. The device had been rumoured earlier this month, with many
suggesting that Google was already working on a Google Glass 2 wearable device.
The Google Glass has currently been made available to developers in order to
bring apps for the device.

Further, the internet search giant is reportedly going to make the device
available to its Google Glass Explorers, who have been given the first prototype
of the device, for $1,500 apiece. Whether the Explorers will get the updated
device for free or not is not known yet. Glass Explorers though have been told
that they will be given three invites to the program and that they can give
these invites to their friends and family members.

Reports say that the Google Glass 2 supports prescription glasses and has a mono
earbud, which is reportedly going to be a replacement for the bone conduction
speaker, which the current version of the device has. The current device also
has a high resolution display and a 5 mega pixel camera, which can also record
HD videos at 720 pixels. It also has 12 GB of internal storage.
