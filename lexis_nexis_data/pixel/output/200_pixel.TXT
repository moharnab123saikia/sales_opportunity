go. They often got Android updates before everyone else and it looks like the
case will be the same for the new Pixel phones.

Google's support site stated that both Pixel and Pixel XL will get Android
version updates for two years at the very least from the time the devices become
available. Update should also come within two weeks of release, reports
TechRadar.

Beyond this time frame, Android updates can't be guaranteed anymore, which would
be similar to Google's two-year plan for the Nexus smartphones.

Once the update time frame is up, the Pixel and Pixel XL will continue to
receive security updates for at least three years since the phones first became
available.

But similar to the Nexus series, there is no guarantee that the Pixel phones
will get all the latest software updates barring hardware requirements and other
factors. For now, Pixel is the new Nexus and it offers the purest Android
experience currently available.
