available today. Way to steal your own thunder Google!



Thursday, November 14, 2013: The big news on Wednesday (13 November) was the

launch of the Moto G smartphone by the Google owned company. Motorola is

seemingly taking on competitors in the entry level smartphone market, trying to

cash in on the nearly half a billion customers in this segment.



At the launch, Motorola CEO Dennis Woodside explained how entry level

smartphones compromise on quality or features in order to come at a low price.

He event cited a certain Galaxy Phone to prove his point. According to Woodside,

the Moto G is an entry level smartphone, which can compete with the iPhone 5S in

some aspects.



In its specifications, the hero of the device is the 11.4-cm (4.5-inch) 720

pixel display with Gorilla Glass protection. The device is powered by a 1.2 GHz

Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad core processor and has 1 GB of RAM. In addition, it

also has a 5 mega pixel rear camera and a 1.3 mega pixel front camera. It

currently runs the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean operating system, but Motorola has

promised a KitKat upgrade by January 2014. Interestingly, this is also the time

when the phone is expected to arrive in India.



Currently, the Moto G is scheduled to go on sale in Brazil and in some parts of

Europe. The company said that it would be available in Latin America, other

parts of Europe, Canada and some parts of Asia in the next few weeks. It will be

launched in the US, Middle East, India and in some other parts of Asia in

January.



The smartphone is priced at a competitive $179 for the 8 GB variant and $199 GB

for the 16 GB variant in the US market. Both the prices are off contract. It

also draws from Motorola's efforts towards a customisable smartphone with

interchangeable Motorola Shells and Flip Shells available in seven different

colours. In addition, there are also Grip Shells available in five colours.
