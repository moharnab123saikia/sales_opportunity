New images have leaked from British mobile phone retailer, Carphone Warehouse
reveals specifications of the long-awaited Pixel smartphones from Google. The
devices are expected to be announced at Google's October 4th event.

The images seem to be product shots taken by Google. According to the images,
the search giant will unveil at least two smartphones -- Pixel and Pixel XL --
at the event.

The first image gives a comprehensive side by side look of the phones with a
tagline that reads "introducing Pixel phone by Google"

The image also confirms that the devices will be available in two sizes,
accessibility to Google personal assistant, Google Duo, Google Allo, Google
designer cases and USB Type-C Charger which Google says will give seven hours of
battery life with 15 minutes of charging.

Perhaps the most intriguing feature is the unlimited storage of photos and
videos in full resolution in Google Photos.

The phones also seem to have a 3.5mm audio jack located at the top of the
smartphone and fingerprint scanner placed at the back.

The Pixel smartphones are expected to be launched sporting an AMOLED display
with Gorilla Glass 4. The standard Pixel should have a 5-inch display with 1080
resolution while the Pixel XL will reportedly be equipped with a 5.5-inch screen
with a 1440p resolution.

Other specifications include 4GB RAM, 32GB or 128GB of inbuilt storage
(expandable via microSD,) Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 clocked at 2.15GHz, Android
7.1, nanoSIM slots, 8-megapixel front camera and 12-megapixel rear camera and a
2770mAh battery (Pixel) and a 3450mAh battery (Pixel XL).

The listings very similar to previous rumours of the devices.

If accurate, these are the most detailed look of the devices that we can expect
to get before the actual event. However, everything is still subject to change
until the smartphones are unveiled.
