According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Encoding and decoding a video image having a plurality of frames using a

two-step quantization and coding process are disclosed. A block of a frame are

encoded by identifying pixels having certain spatial characteristics, forming a

second block from the block while replacing the identified pixels with a single

pixel value, such as an average of the remaining original pixels. The second

block is encoded, such as by transformation and quantization, and placed into a

bitstream. The second block is decoded and subtracted from the original block to

generate a difference block. The difference block is encoded, such as by

quantization, and is placed in the bitstream. At a decoder, both blocks are

decoded and combined to reconstruct the original block."



The Patent was filed on August 9, 2012 under application No. 20140044164
