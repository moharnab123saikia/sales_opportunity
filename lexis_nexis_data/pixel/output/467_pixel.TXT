According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Encoding and decoding a video image having a plurality of frames using a
two-step quantization and coding process are disclosed. A block of a frame are
encoded by identifying pixels having certain spatial characteristics, forming a
second block from the block while replacing the identified pixels with a single
pixel value, such as an average of the remaining original pixels. The second
block is encoded, such as by transformation and quantization, and placed into a
bitstream. The second block is decoded and subtracted from the original block to
generate a difference block. The difference block is encoded, such as by
quantization, and is placed in the bitstream. At a decoder, both blocks are
decoded and combined to reconstruct the original block."

The Patent was filed on August 9, 2012 under application No. 20140044164
