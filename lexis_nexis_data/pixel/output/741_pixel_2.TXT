which was launched at a price of INR 28,999 for the16 GB model and 32,999 for
the 32GB model the latest Nexus 6 seems to take a premium slot in pricing.

While Android developers would still want to purchase this handset even at high
price as a Smartphone lover do you have similar phones at a lower price range?
Dailybhaskar.com brings you 5 top phones you could buy if you are discouraged by
the prices of Nexus 6.


Quick specs of the Nexus 6 handset are 4K display (3840 x 2160 pixels), Android
5.0 Lollipop operating system, 3 GB RAM, 13 megapixel rear camera with dual led
flash ring, 2 megapixel camera and a battery of 3220 mAh battery.

Moto X 2nd Generation

The 5.2 inch Moto X 2nd Generation too is a great pick. This handset too is
designed by Motorola (who also designed the Nexus 6 this year) and is powered by
2.5 Ghz Quadcore Core Snapdragon 801 processor and 2GB RAM.

The phone sports a 13 megapixel primary camera with a ring-flash for more
balanced light and less shadows (like Nexus 6). And yes, it does runs stock
Android operating system, which would no doubt get updated to Lollipop soon.

The only constrain with the handset could be its 16GB internal storage which is
non-expandable. The handset could be purchased at INR 34,000 today.

Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro

If quad HD is something that appeals to you, have a look at the Lenovo Vibe Z2
Pro with a huge 6-inch display and 2K display (quad HD display of 2560 x 1440
pixels). This metal-bodied handset is powered by a 2.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon
801 processor with 3GB of RAM and also sports a 16 megapixel primary camera with
auto scene detection and optical image stabilization.

This handset costs about INR 33,000 today.

Google Nexus 5

Buying the Google Nexus 5 today is not a bad idea. This uses stock Android
operating system and Google would update the handset with Android Lollipop OS
update very soon (at least before others update their flagships).

This 2.3 GHz Snapdragon 800 processor powered phone with 32GB internal memory is
priced at less than INR 30,000 in few store today.

Oppo OnePlus One

If you haven't looked at the Oppo OnePlus One yet, you need to have a look at

handset with 2.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and 3GB RAM. The handset
sports 130-megapixel Sony Exmor IMX214 camera on the back side

Since this handset is yet to be available in the market we would not recommend
this to you. But given the price point and attractive specification sheet, this
would make a good buy.

LG G3

5.5-inch display with a display resolution 2560 x 1440 pixels, 13 megapixel
camera on the back with pretty good camera app, 3000 mAh battery and 2.5 GHz
quad-core Qualcomm MSM8975AC Snapdragon 801 processor coupled with 3GB RAM - the
LG G3 too is not a bad option.

This phone in 32GB memory is available at less than INR 40,000 in India.

Nokia Lumia 1520

The 6-inch full HD Nokia Lumia 1520 is another good option to save some money.
Well, this is not an Android operating system phone and hence is an ideal but
for a big screen lover who is not averse to switching operating system.

This phone comes with 2GB RAM and 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad core
processor sports a 20 megapixel primary camera with dual flash light and comes
at a price less than INR 37,000 today.

upcoming firmware release for the handset this year. The update would bring 'Hey
