Google has just announced the price of Google Nexus 6 in the Indian market, as

its lists the handset in the Google Play store. This 6-inch handset has been

priced at INR 44,000 for 32GB model and INR 49,000 for 64GB model.



Does this sound a costly affair? Compared to the price of Nexus 6 last year

which was launched at a price of INR 28,999 for the16 GB model and 32,999 for

the 32GB model the latest Nexus 6 seems to take a premium slot in pricing.



While Android developers would still want to purchase this handset even at high

price as a Smartphone lover do you have similar phones at a lower price range?

Dailybhaskar.com brings you 5 top phones you could buy if you are discouraged by

the prices of Nexus 6.





Quick specs of the Nexus 6 handset are 4K display (3840 x 2160 pixels), Android

5.0 Lollipop operating system, 3 GB RAM, 13 megapixel rear camera with dual led

flash ring, 2 megapixel camera and a battery of 3220 mAh battery.



Moto X 2nd Generation



The 5.2 inch Moto X 2nd Generation too is a great pick. This handset too is

designed by Motorola (who also designed the Nexus 6 this year) and is powered by

2.5 Ghz Quadcore Core Snapdragon 801 processor and 2GB RAM.



The phone sports a 13 megapixel primary camera with a ring-flash for more

balanced light and less shadows (like Nexus 6). And yes, it does runs stock

Android operating system, which would no doubt get updated to Lollipop soon.



The only constrain with the handset could be its 16GB internal storage which is

non-expandable. The handset could be purchased at INR 34,000 today.



Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro



If quad HD is something that appeals to you, have a look at the Lenovo Vibe Z2

Pro with a huge 6-inch display and 2K display (quad HD display of 2560 x 1440

pixels). This metal-bodied handset is powered by a 2.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon

801 processor with 3GB of RAM and also sports a 16 megapixel primary camera with

auto scene detection and optical image stabilization.



This handset costs about INR 33,000 today.



Google Nexus 5



Buying the Google Nexus 5 today is not a bad idea. This uses stock Android

operating system and Google would update the handset with Android Lollipop OS

update very soon (at least before others update their flagships).



This 2.3 GHz Snapdragon 800 processor powered phone with 32GB internal memory is

priced at less than INR 30,000 in few store today.



Oppo OnePlus One



If you haven't looked at the Oppo OnePlus One yet, you need to have a look at

this handset now. This 'flagship killer' (as Oppo calls it is a INR 28,000

handset with 2.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and 3GB RAM. The handset

sports 130-megapixel Sony Exmor IMX214 camera on the back side



Since this handset is yet to be available in the market we would not recommend

this to you. But given the price point and attractive specification sheet, this

would make a good buy.



LG G3



5.5-inch display with a display resolution 2560 x 1440 pixels, 13 megapixel

camera on the back with pretty good camera app, 3000 mAh battery and 2.5 GHz

quad-core Qualcomm MSM8975AC Snapdragon 801 processor coupled with 3GB RAM - the

LG G3 too is not a bad option.



This phone in 32GB memory is available at less than INR 40,000 in India.



Nokia Lumia 1520



The 6-inch full HD Nokia Lumia 1520 is another good option to save some money.

Well, this is not an Android operating system phone and hence is an ideal but

for a big screen lover who is not averse to switching operating system.



This phone comes with 2GB RAM and 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad core

processor sports a 20 megapixel primary camera with dual flash light and comes

at a price less than INR 37,000 today.



Microsoft will start rolling out Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 plus Lumia Denim

upcoming firmware release for the handset this year. The update would bring 'Hey

Cortona' voice assistant and camera updates to the new phone.
