According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Disclosed herein is a method for selectively filtering and encoding a video

signal having at least one frame including a matrix of pixels. The method

includes selecting a set of pixels within the frame, determining an initial

performance measurement for the selected set of pixels, provisionally applying

each filter to the set of pixels, determining a second performance measurement

for each filter provisionally applied to the selected set of pixels, and

applying the at least one filter to the selected set of pixels to generate a

reconstruction of the frame if the at least one filter is determined to have a

second performance measurement that is better than the initial performance

measurement."
