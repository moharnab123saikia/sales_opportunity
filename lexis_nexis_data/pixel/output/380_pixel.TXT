According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Disclosed herein is a method for selectively filtering and encoding a video
signal having at least one frame including a matrix of pixels. The method
includes selecting a set of pixels within the frame, determining an initial
performance measurement for the selected set of pixels, provisionally applying
each filter to the set of pixels, determining a second performance measurement
for each filter provisionally applied to the selected set of pixels, and
applying the at least one filter to the selected set of pixels to generate a
reconstruction of the frame if the at least one filter is determined to have a
second performance measurement that is better than the initial performance
measurement."
