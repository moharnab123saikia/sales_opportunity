Google Pixel, Pixel XL launch: Google is all set to pull up the curtains on its
products at today's event in San Francisco. The live stream of the special event
by Google will start soon. After the much hyped Apple event last month, it is
now Google's turn to launch its brand new smartphones Pixel and Pixel XL in what
looks to be an extravagant affair.

As Google is all set to make some major hardware announcements on October 4,
consumers can still see some signs of the changes and guess what to expect.
Google has an annual ritual of announcing its flagship smartphones, yet this
year appears to be distinct. Google in an enigmatic new advertisement had shown
a box, devoid of context which metamorphosised into a rectangular shape
symbolising a smartphone alongside the Google logo and 'Oct 4' written.

Here are LIVE updates on Google Pixel launch event:

9.08 pm: A day ahead of the Google Pixel launch event, the tech giant decided to

9.05 pm: The Google live stream will begin shortly. In order to watch the Google
event live, viewers will have to follow the action by watching the live stream.

So far we do not know when Google will launch Pixel and Pixel XL in India, but
as seen with its Nexus phone, Google does not delay launches in India.
