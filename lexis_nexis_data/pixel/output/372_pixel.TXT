NEW DELHI: Google's revamp of its Android One operating system for smartphones

does not appear to have helped the search giant much, if shipment data from

market research firm Cybex Exim Solutions is anything to go by.



In the second version -which was brought out by vendor Lava -Google shifted

focus to people who have used smartphones before with higher device price and

better specs of Pixel V1, but it failed to enthuse consumers -shipments dropped

sharply in September and October, according to data from Cybex Exim. ET was

given exclusive access to this data.



Lava, however, disagreed. "Lava Pixel V1 has received a positive response in the

market," the company said in response to ET's queries, adding that the device is

getting the Android Marshmallow upgrade. Google did not respond to ET's query on

the matter till the time of going to press.



Lava, which was phase 2 partner for Google's Android One initiative, rolled out

Pixel V1 in July for over Rs 11,000 -almost double the price of the first

handsets launched a year ago.



Data aside, experts and market insiders said that by not bringing the 4G LTE

variant of the latest Android One smartphone in India, Google and Lava failed to

gauge consumer need and market trend, which resulted in their device not doing

as well as the 4G devices that Chinese and domestic handset vendors launched at

much lower price points. Google's partners in Thailand and Philippines -I-mobile

and Cherry Mobile, respectively -had a different plan around the time Lava

launched Pixel V1 in India -they both launched the LTE variants of Android One

smartphone.



"The Pixel V1 started off well on account of aggressive marketing push, but lost

to the competition in late Q3 of 2015 due to new LTE launches in the same

segment tar geted at the festive season," said Tarun Pathak, senior analyst with

Counterpoint Research.



Sources had earlier told ET that Google has spent about $10 million Rs 60-100

crore) on marketing and (.promotion for the second phase of the Android One

project in India.In July, Lava had imported 38,730 units of the Android One

smartphone. The following month the figure leaped to 83,750 units, only to

plunge to 5,000 units in September and 2,500 units in October, according to data

from Cybex Exim.



According to Pathak, Lenovo's K3 Note was the best-selling device in the third

quarter with almost 800,000 units sold. In comparison, Pixel V1 -which falls in

a similar price segment as K3 -has gone just past 100,000 units during the same

period, despite marketing support from Google and the offline retail strength of

Lava.



"Pixel V1 even remained behind Lava's bestselling smartphones under its IRIS and

Flair series, as lack of LTE in sub $150 segment impacted its growth," Pathak

said, adding that Google needs to create positioning of Android One devices, the

way it does with way it does with Nexus devices. It should be positioned as the

`Nexus' of entry level segment.



According to Counterpoint, only 1.2 million units of Android One were shipped to

India during its first year (September 2014 to September 2015) in the country,

making up only 3.5% of the $50100 phone market, the segment which sells the most

phones.



Only 3 million devices are said to have been shipped in total across the 19

countries that Android One has launched in. Of this, 85% of sales took place in

the Asia-Pacific market.



Counterpoint's Pathak said that for Android One to succeed in India, Google and

its partners need to scale down to lower price points and differentiate the

product from biggest competitor which is "Android" itself, which is competing

with Android One via original equipment makers (OEM) that are present across

$50-$100 price band in India.
