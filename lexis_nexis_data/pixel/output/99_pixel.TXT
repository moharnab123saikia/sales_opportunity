Google's new Pixel phones should be on a smartphone shopper's short list -- and

not just for those disheartened by Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall.



Pixel is a winner for anyone looking for an excellent phone. Start with cameras

that are at the very least on par with the terrific cameras on the Samsung

Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7. Add the baked-in voice-enabled Google Assistant,

Google's answer to Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa, where

another battleground is poised to take place. Google's voice brings a high IQ

and a world of potential.



Over  several days, I've been testing the larger of the two Pixel models, the

Pixel XL, which boasts a lovely Quad HD 5.5-inch display and costs $769 for 32

gigabytes of storage or $869 for 128 GB. The smaller Pixel has a full HD 5-inch

screen and costs $649 or $749, respectively.



The phones are already on back order and will be available through Verizon

(exclusive U.S. carrier), at Best Buy, via Google's Project Fi or Google's own

Play Store. You can get an unlocked version that will work with any of the other

major U.S. carriers. Key takeaways:



Design: Pixels are crafted out of an aerospace-grade aluminum slab and glass.

The XL model is a tad shorter than the iPhone 7 Plus. The relatively wide bezels

on the front appear to be mostly wasted real estate, as there are no physical

buttons. On the upper third of the back, Pixel has a Gorilla Glass-covered glass

shade that reveals smudges.



What I do like is that there's no camera bump -- the rear lens and flash lie

flat. The fingerprint sensor you can use to unlock the phone is also on the

rear.



Pixels run the latest version of Android called Nougat and with Google in

charge, you ought to get software updates as soon as they are ready. The phone

has a robust Qualcomm processor.



And score one for Google against the iPhone 7: Pixel has the same standard

3.55mm headphone connector that the iPhone 7 got rid of and that every other

smartphone I know has.



Alas, there's only a single speaker on Pixel; Apple added stereo speakers to the

iPhone 7 and other smartphones also have them. And unlike the iPhone 7 or

ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, Pixel is not fully water-resistant.



Camera. I detected only subtle differences between the pictures and videos I

shot here (under all sorts of lighting conditions) and those I've captured on a

Galaxy or the iPhone. Consider that high praise. I was impressed with the color

and fine detail on most shots. By double-twisting the phone, you can switch from

the rear camera to the front 8-megapixel selfie camera or back, a trick that

usually worked.



Maybe as important as the picture quality is what you can do with your images.

Google is giving Pixel owners unlimited free cloud storage at full resolution

for all the pictures and videos shot with the phone, including 4K video. That's

a big deal.



Google Assistant:  Google is pushing the conversational aspects of its AI-based

Assistant further than its rivals'.



I asked Assistant to "tell me about my day" and it reported weather, told me

what appointments I had coming and how long my commute would take. Without

prompting, it then played radio broadcasts from NPR, Fox, News, Bloomberg and

BBC.



When I asked it to show me pictures of Sydney with horses, it correctly surmised

that I meant my daughter, Sydney, rather than Sydney, Australia, and found

pictures I'd taken of her with horses. When I instead asked the Assistant to

"show me pictures of Sydney with bridges" it pulled pictures of the Sydney

Harbour Bridge off the Web.



It even identified songs where I knew only a few of the lyrics and played them.



Most promising is the idea you can continue a conversation without repeating

search parameters at each step. I asked Google to show me pictures of dogs and

it did so off the Web. Without mentioning dogs, I followed up with "how about by

the beach?" It surfaced Web images of canines by the beach. Impressive.



Battery. The phone kept a charge well into the evenings during mixed use; since

I never ran it down, I didn't get to test a fast-charging feature that Google

claims can get you up to seven hours of juice in just 15 minutes.



Pixel will be the first phone to support Google Daydream, but the mobile

virtual-reality headset wasn't yet available for testing.



The phones are powerful and darn intelligent and demonstrate Google's commitment

to be a major player in the space.
