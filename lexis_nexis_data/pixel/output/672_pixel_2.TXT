Google has a new logo - but it's so subtle, hardly anyone has noticed;

This isn't the first time Google has made tweaks to its classic logo - recently

the firm dropped their signature textural effect after a 16 year run

Google made the headlines recentlywith their doodle to mark the

107th birthday of author Rachel Carsonand again to              mark polling day

across the continent, but did you notice their new logo?



Well a few keen Redditors have, and have even taken to the internet to share

their new discovery.



If you can't tell the difference, don't panic, very few of us can.



The subtle logo change saw the "g" shift one pixel to the right, and the "l" one

pixel right and one pixel down.



One user wrote: "The bottom of the 'l' and 'e' did not line up horizontally and

that, my friend, must have driven some design employee crazy."



Another eagle-eyed Google fan picked up on a change in colour, adding that

there's been an increase in the "yellow saturation".



The new look is cleaner and more browser-friendly - so much so, that we can

hardly notice the difference!



This isn't the first time Google has tweaked its logo - they recently dropped

the textural effect that had characterized the brand throughout its 16-year

history.
