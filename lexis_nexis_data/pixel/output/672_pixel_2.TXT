107th birthday of author Rachel Carsonand again to              mark polling day
across the continent, but did you notice their new logo?

Well a few keen Redditors have, and have even taken to the internet to share
their new discovery.

If you can't tell the difference, don't panic, very few of us can.

The subtle logo change saw the "g" shift one pixel to the right, and the "l" one
pixel right and one pixel down.

One user wrote: "The bottom of the 'l' and 'e' did not line up horizontally and
that, my friend, must have driven some design employee crazy."

Another eagle-eyed Google fan picked up on a change in colour, adding that
there's been an increase in the "yellow saturation".

The new look is cleaner and more browser-friendly - so much so, that we can
hardly notice the difference!

This isn't the first time Google has tweaked its logo - they recently dropped
the textural effect that had characterized the brand throughout its 16-year
history.
