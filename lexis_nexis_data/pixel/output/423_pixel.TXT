[News Focus] Rivals eye gap left by outgoing Samsung Galaxy Note 7



LENGTH: 563 words





In the aftermath of Samsung Electronics' decision to discontinue sales and

production of the problem-ridden Galaxy Note 7 globally, attention is now

shifting to which alternative smartphones consumers around the world will turn

to instead.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Samsung on Tuesday announced that it is "officially ending the

sales as well as production of the smartphone to ensure consumer safety,"

following multiple incidents in which the exchanged Note 7 devices fitted with

new batteries caught fire due to overheating.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]The South Korean electronics giant also initiated a global

refund and exchange program, including in the US and Korea, in partnership with

local carriers and retail partners. Customers can receive a full refund or

exchange their Note 7 devices with any other smartphone.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]As Samsung pulls the Note 7 from the world's biggest markets

for premium smartphones, rival electronics giants Apple, LG Electronics and

Google are expected to score new purchases from some 2.6 million Galaxy Note 7

owners looking for alternative high-end smartphones.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Apple's newly released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, LG

Electronics' V20 and Google's new premium Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones are

slated to compete for market share in the absence of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Customers who are familiar with Android-based smartphones are

likely to prefer smartphones from Google and LG, while others disappointed with

the Samsung brand could choose to switch to Apple's iOS-based iPhone models.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]At the same time, some users who remain loyal to Samsung may

turn to former Samsung smartphones -- including the Galaxy Note 5 launched last

year or the smaller-sized Galaxy S7 released earlier this year -- or simply wait

for the release of the Galaxy S8 next year.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Last month, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus began sales in more

than 30 countries around the world including the US and China. The two new

iPhone models are slated for release on Oct. 21 in Korea.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]The iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch display while the iPhone 7

Plus comes with a larger 5.5-inch full HD display. Both devices run on the iOS

10 operating system.



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Setting itself apart from previous models, the new iPhone 7 and

iPhone 7 Plus do not have earphone sockets, and are instead accompanied by

wireless earphones -- which has driven some customers away from the new iPhones.



The LG V20 (Yonhap)



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Meanwhile, LG Electronics has the 5.7-inch LG V20, co-designed

by LG and Denmark-based luxury stereo brand Bang & Olufsen, boasting high-end

audio and camera features. It runs on the Google Android 7.0 Nougat operating

system and comes with a removable battery. The LG V20 is slated to launch in the

US by Oct. 28. The device is already available in Korea.



Google`s Pixel (AP-Yonhap)



ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Google's 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL are also strong

options favored by Android enthusiasts. The Pixel comes with a 12.3-megapixel

rear camera and a 8-megapixel front-facng selfie camera. It is also the first

phone to officially feature the artificial intelligence software Google

Assistance.



The device is slated for release in the US later this month. Google has yet to

announce a launch date for Korea.
