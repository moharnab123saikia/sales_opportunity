Google's Five Breakthroughs And Failures In 2013



LENGTH: 556  words





We bring to you Google's greatest hits and misses in the year gone by.



Tuesday, January 07, 2014: Last year was an eventful year for Google in more

than one way. The giant announced several gadgets and saw some major setbacks

too. For every Chromebook Pixel or Amazing Google+ GIF, there was a vaguely

dystopian off-note involving government intrusions or killer robots.



As stated on networkworld.com, here's taking a look at Google's greatest wins

and fails last year.



HITS



1. Chromecast - Google's Chromecast costing $35 is quite a simple and cheap

device that converts any TV into a web-streaming device through a simple click

of a button. Its deep integration with Android apps like Hulu Plus, Netflix, and

YouTube make it a good contender against competitors like Apple TV and Roku

boxes.



2. Waze -Google took over the crowd-sourced, commuter-focused navigation service

at $1 billion in July. It plans to keep Waze a separate entity for the time

being. However, Waze traffic information is already boosting Google products,

which include Maps and Google Now.



3. EFF report card and the fight for privacy -Google recently got high marks

from the Electronic Frontier Foundation for the extent to which the company

protects user data from prying eyes. Google and many other companies (including

Dropbox, Facebook, and SpiderOak), received five out of five stars for

implementing or making a promise to implement different encryption methods.



4. Chromebook Pixel - The Pixel has an aluminum body and high resolution display

that proves that Chromebooks can be more than cheap, plasticky machines.

However, PC makers raced to adopt the Chrome OS platform in the Pixel's wake, to

create affordable laptops, which made Google's browser-in-a-box more attractive

to budget PC buyers.



5. Street View Donkey - When a donkey was hit by Google's Street View Fleet and

there were rumours regarding the donkey getting injured, Google calmly explained

in a tongue-in-cheek blog post titled "Never ass-ume" that the Internet had got

it totally wrong and the donkey was not at all injured after its close encounter

with Google's Street View fleet.



MISSES



1. The Barge - Google's Barge was a bit more than a floating showroom but is now

on a hiatus till late 2014, while Google deals with design requests from the

U.S. Coast Guard.



2. Google Reader - Google terminated its RSS web app in July stating that it

didn't have ample users to justify its existence. It was a great utility tool

for anybody who wished to keep a tab on multiple blogs and websites in one spot.



3. Moto Maker - This app is a great tool aimed towards personalizing your Moto X

smartphone with just the right shade of blue. However, this was blown up as

Google's Moto Maker was exclusive to AT&T for nearly three months pushing Moto X

fans on competing carriers to make do with plain white or black handsets.



4. Google+ YouTube comments - A petition on Change.org has attracted over

225,000 supporters as of this writing, with most people complaining about the

loss of anonymity and the need to sign up for Google+.



5. Ads in mail's clothing - A short time after Google cleaned up its clients

Gmail accounts with tabs, it commenced inserting advertisements into their

inboxes which seemed suspiciously like regular mail messages. The ads appear

only under Promotions tab, paired with an ad label.
