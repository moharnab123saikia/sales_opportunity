Virtual reality has a new entry-level competitor: a fabric-covered headset from

Google that will compete with the mid-market $99 Samsung VR.



Daydream View is a $79 mobile virtual-reality headset -- with, notably, a VR

motion controller that is normally in the domain of more expensive VR gear --

that will be compatible with Google's just-announced Pixel smartphones and

eventually other Daydream-certified handsets. Google first announced its

Daydream VR platform at its I/O conference last May.



Preorders for Daydream View start later this month, with the product slated to

ship in early November. It will be available in slate gray, crimson or snow

colors.



Daydream promises to go well beyond Google Cardboard, the company's early entry

into VR, and comes at a time of heavy activity in the still-developing alternate

reality universe. Wednesday, Facebook-owned Oculus kicks off its Connect

developer event in San Jose. Sony is poised to bring out its VR offering,

PlayStation VR.



As a mobile offering, think of Daydream View more as a direct competitor of

Samsung Gear VR (which is powered by Oculus), a similar-looking headset that

works with specific high-end Samsung phones. In contrast, PlayStation VR, which

plugs into a PlayStation video game console, Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive system

all cost hundreds more and are tethered by cables to powerful computers.



The View headset is roughly a third lighter than Gear VR, Google says, and

features a stretchy, breathable fabric that is supposed to provide a comfortable

fit, which could encourage longer viewing.



View uses an alignment system of conductive knobs that make contact with the

front of the phone screen to determine which pixels are aligned with which

knobs, which the software then self-corrects as needed, providing, Google

claims, a better optic experience. The headset and phone get in sync wirelessly.



The real difference in this segment of the market is the portable palm-sized

View controller, which allows you to swipe and click through content that you're

watching. The controller provides 3 degrees of freedom and is flexible enough to

be used by apps and games that let you draw, paint or swing it like a baseball

bat or golf club.



While Google is taking ownership of this initial Daydream View headset, it also

is opening up the Daydream specs to other Android hardware partners to modify

and add elements to Daydream and presumably to commercialize their own VR

offering as they see fit.



So what exactly will you be able to watch on Daydream? For starters, YouTube has

developed a VR app built especially for the platform, with VR, 360 and

2D-content available. Through Google Street View, you'll be able to watch 150

virtual tours of such places as the Taj Mahal or Great Barrier Reef. You'll also

be able to take in purchased or rented flicks through the Google Play Store--the

movies will be in 2D but you'll be able to watch in an immersive big-screen-type

VR environment.
