According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Methods, systems and computer program products for automatic color correction

of image and video content are provided. A computer-implemented method may

include generating an auto-level linear transform and a histogram equalization

transform of a color distribution histogram for an original image among a set of

sequential images. The auto-level linear transform and the histogram

equalization transform are blended to create a modified image. Pixel color is

adjusted in the modified image so that a color difference between a pixel and

neighboring pixels in the modified image corresponds to a color difference

between respective pixels in the original image."
