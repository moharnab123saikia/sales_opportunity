According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "An

image comprising color pixels with varying illumination is selected. Instances

of a repeating pattern in the image are determined. Illumination values for

illuminated pixels at locations within instances of the repeating pattern are

calculated based on pixel intensities of non-illuminated pixels at corresponding

locations in other instances of the repeating pattern. The illumination

variation is removed from the illuminated pixels based on the calculated

illumination values to produce enhanced pixels. Color from the non-illuminated

pixels at the corresponding locations in other instances of the repeating

pattern is propagated to the enhanced pixels."



The patent was filed on May 1, 2012 Application no. 13/461,482
