

Google has an official announcement slated for October 4 - but it looks like the
internet couldn't wait that long.

The company is widely expected to announce a couple of new smartphones that will
do battle with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. And now a leaked image appears to
have revealed the finished product.

Google Pixel and Pixel XL 2016 release date expected at October 4 event

It was posted on Twitter and tech site VentureBeat before being swiftly picked
up and circulated around the rest of the tech industry press.

The image seems to confirm a lot of what we already new about the new Google
phone: Thinner bezels and lack of any physical home buttons.

In fact, the announcement on October 4 may just be something of a formality at
this point as most gadget fans are already well aware of what the phone will be
offering.

It's widely rumoured to boast a 5-inch, 1080p screen with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of
storage. The camera will have a 12 megapixel sensor whilst the battery will be a
respectable 2,770mAh non-removable one.

And, unlike the iPhone 7, Google is keeping the 3.5mm headphone jack that will
appear on the top of both the Pixel and Pixel XL.

It seems that both phones will be manufactured by HTC and, as with previous
Google devices, will offer a clean version of the latest Android operating
system.
