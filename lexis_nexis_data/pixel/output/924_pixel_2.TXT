Google to introduce new 'Andromeda' OS for laptops



LENGTH: 163  words





With the release of the Pixel phones less than a day away, the rumor mill has

shifted to a juicier topic. This one revolves around an apparently new operating

system from Google that will run on a new laptop.



The new OS is being dubbed as 'Andromeda' and will be merging aspects of Chrome

OS into Android, reports Business Insider.



Additional reports from Android Police and 9to5Google corroborate the new rumor

and adds that 'Andromeda' may be coming out together with a new Huawei Nexus

tablet.



The laptop that would be running 'Andromeda,' on the other hand, is said to be

codenamed 'Bison,' formerly 'Pixel 3.' This laptop is said to have a 12-inch

form factor under 10mm thick and equipped with a touchscreen display.



Speculations from Android Police places the Bison among the 'convertible'

devices such as the Lenovo Yoga laptop series.



Apart from the hardware speculations, there has been no word yet as to what

exactly would set Andromeda apart from the standard Android OS.
