Apple's iPad Mini and the Nexus 7 from Google are the two fierce competitors for

the top spot when it comes to 7-inch tablet devices as both are ergonomically

designed with software features and hardware specifications that suits the

current demand for an effective mobile productivity and flexibility.



Apple's foray into the 7-inch tablet market with the launch of the 7.9-inch iPad

Mini steamed the already brittle battle between the mini-pad likes of Amazon's

Kindle, Nook and HTC One X.



Apple's drive to follow Google's trend and venture into the new market simple

reveals that the future points towards mini pad as possible replacement for

smartphones and viable challenge for the tablet market with increasing demand

for portable, powerful and all-in-one device model.



The iPad Mini, in almost every way is packed with specifications that match that

of the iPad 2 thus presenting the device as a very powerful productivity tool.

tablet been belled by Google's latest mobile operating system.



7-inch tablet devices are touch-screen devices with a display measuring between

7.0 - 7.9 inches diagonally.



7-inch tablet is just pocketable and easily allows for single hand operations;

whereas the slightly bigger 7.9 inches like Apple's iPad mini pushes the limit

and in-effect may present some difficulties when it comes to single hand

operations and comfort of fitting into pant pockets.



Nexus 7 tend to be easier to hold but the iPad Mini has a bigger screen. This

now comes down to preference and the purpose for which the mini tablet is

required, however, for leisure around the house, the iPad Mini's larger display

offers an idea tool.



But for a more mobile working experience, Nexus 7 presents a better comfort zone

in terms of size and weight.



Apple's latest iOS 6 cores the iPad mini,



the operating system comes with over 200 new features. Apple's ecosystem of

computer devices also makes it easy to synchronize the iPad Mini with other

devices giving room for remote backup of the tablet's memory.



iOS 6 features an enhanced notification center and a more useful Siri. The

replacement of Google Maps with Apple Maps presented an unfinished service which

left lots of Apple devotees frustrated with its location service applications.



Nexus 7 has 4.1(4.2 update now available) Jelly Bean Android OS belle; it

features an integrated notification center and electronic assistant as well as

hundreds of thousands of apps through Google Play. With the project butter

effect the OS tends to improve the VSync; this set the frame rate for the entire

OS at 60 frames-per-second thus improving the perception of speed and

responsiveness by making everything consistent.



Apple's A5 processor which is a dual core 1GHz processor with 512GB of RAM

powers the iPad mini, also available in 16GB, 32GB and 64GB with no memory

expansion slot like microSD card.



The quad-core processing chip NVidia Tegra 2 T30L processor powers Google's

Nexus 7; it features a 1.2GHz ARM Cortex-A9 with 16GB RAM.



Nexus 7's processor out-performs that of iPad Mini but with 8GB of storage that

can be expanded to 16GB.

with no Retina Display and 162 pixels per inch (PPI), while Google's Nexus 7

features an impressive 1280x800 pixel resolution and 216 PPI. Both devices

feature light sensors and scratch-resistant glass.
