Google could merge Chrome OS and Android, according to a report by the Wall

Street Journal. The game changing merger of Google could take place next year,

but it is not certain yet.



Android will familiarize better to PCs. The two of the operating systems will

become a single new operating system by 2017. Google supposedly aims to boast an

early version of it may be next year.



Sundar Pichai was put to responsibility of both Chrome and Android OS back in

2013. If this was the reason to consider, then both the operating systems would

have grow closer earlier, taking into account that the same person has gained

more power as the CEO of Alphabet's Google. Former vice president of engineering

for just Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer, gained helm for Chrome as well, showing

that Google's constant interest in the two platforms rising more consistent.



Earlier, Pixel C used to provide a symbol of the best way to experience Chrome

OS. On the other hand, the latest Pixel device will give a finest Android

experience. Android apps though slowly still are making their approach into

Chrome OS. Similarly, Chrome tabs have been given more important position on

Android devices.



Assumption has prevailed for years, but the report from The Wall Street Journal

comes as news and not as an editorial. Still nothing can be said as long as it

happens in real.
