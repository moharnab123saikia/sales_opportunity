Wednesday, September 30, 2015: Search engine giant Google has unveiled new Nexus

smartphones during the launch event, which was held in San Francisco on Tuesday.

Dubbed as the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the phones have been listed on a Google

Play Store page. However, the company has still not revealed pricing and

availability details of the Nexus devices in India.



If we talk about the specifications, the Nexus 5X is slightly bigger than the

Nexus 5 sporting a 13.20cm (5.2-inch) FullHD display with a resolution of

1080x1920 pixels. Powered by a 1.82GHz hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808

processor coupled with Adreno 418 GPU and 2GB RAM, the device comes with 16 and

32GB of built-in storage without expandability through microSD card. Backed by a

non-removable 2700mAh battery, it runs on the much anticipated Android 6.0

Marshmallow out-of-the-box and promises to bring the latest updates directly

from Google.



The handset comes with a USB Type-C port for faster charging and data transfer

and sports a 12MP rear camera with laser autofocus and dualLED flash besides a

5MP front-facing camera for capturing selfies.



On the other hand, the Nexus 6P features 14.47cm (5.7-inch) QuadHD AMOLED

display with 518ppi pixel density. The handset will come with Qualcomm

Snapdragon 810 chipset which has a 64-bit 2.0GHz octa-core processor with Adreno

430GPU along with 3GB of RAM. With Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection, it comes

in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB storage variants. Sporting an all-metal body design, it

runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box. Sporting a 3450mAh battery, the

phone claims to deliver 7 hours of use with 10mins of charging.



Both the devices will come with the Nexus Imprint fingerprint sensor which

enables you to unlock your phone and purchase apps on the Play Store. Google has

also added an all new hardware based Android Sensor Hub which will track "sensor

fusion, activity recognition, gesture recognition, movements and low power

times."
