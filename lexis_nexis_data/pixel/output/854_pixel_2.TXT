Lava, will get its first major OS upgrade. Android Marshmallow, 6.0 will be
available to Lava Pixel V1 consumers to upgrade from today.

This adds Pixel V1 to a select list of devices including the Nexus phones to get
this upgrade this early. Like other Nexus devices, Lava Pixel V1 has been
rolling out monthly security updates to consumers as minor updates. Now
consumers will be able to enjoy great performance with Marshmallow which brings
out new features. Mentioned below are some prominent changes brought forward by
Marshmallow which sets it apart from its predecessor- Lollipop.

* Enhanced Battery Performance

1. Doze: When the Lava Pixel V1 device with Android Marshmallow is at rest, Doze
automatically puts it into a sleep state to increase standby battery life.

2. App Standby: No more battery drain from apps which are not used so frequently
: App Standby limits their impact on battery life so your charge lasts longer

* Better Security: On the Lava Pixel V1 device with Android Marshmallow, 6.0,
apps designed for Android Marshmallow only ask for permission when it's needed.
Users can deny any permission and still continue to use the app.

* Refreshed Google Now Launcher: The app list includes search, fast alphabetic
scrolling, and predictive App Suggestions. This will be a visible change from
the last Android version and will drastically improve the phone browsing
experience for consumers

* Flex Storage: This makes using SD cards or external storage devices as
encrypted extended storage for your apps and games on Android Marshmallow
easier.

* Direct Share: A simpler and faster way to share to the right person in the
right app.
