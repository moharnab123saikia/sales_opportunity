HARDWARE WARS



SAN FRANCISCO - Google launched an aggressive challenge to consumer electronics

giants like Apple and Samsung on Tuesday, introducing a new line of smartphones

called Pixel and other gadgets designed to showcase a digital helper the company

calls "Google Assistant."



The new devices represent a big push by Google to make and sell its own

hardware, instead of largely just supplying software for other manufacturers. At

a starting price of roughly $650, the new Pixel phones are aimed at the same

markets as Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy flagship phones.



GADGETS ON PARADE



During a media event Tuesday, Google executives showed off a series of gadgets

in rapid succession. Its new Home device is a sleek internet-connected speaker

that's designed to respond to voice commands, like Amazon's popular Echo. A new

virtual reality headset called Daydream View will work with the new Pixel phones

and other Android devices. Also unveiled were a new Wi-Fi router and an update

to the company's Chromecast streaming media device.



In announcing the new Pixel phones, Google executives touted features like a

powerful camera, a long-lasting battery - and a dedicated headphone jack, which

Apple recently eliminated from its latest iPhones. The Pixel phones will be sold

in two screen sizes - 5 inches and 5.5 inches - and three colors: black, silver

and blue.



But they're clearly hoping that the new Pixel phones will be distinguished by

their use of Google's software. A central element of all the new devices is the

Google Assistant, which uses artificial intelligence to deliver what CEO Sundar

Pichai described as "a personal Google for each and every user."



HARDWARE IS HARD



New devices could help Google keep its services front and center in the battle

for consumers' attention, said analyst Julie Ask at Forrester Research. Unlike a

new mobile app or other software, she noted, it can be an expensive gamble to

build and ship new hardware products. "But if you're Google, you can't afford to

stop placing bets."



Google will sell its Pixel phones online and through retail chains like Best Buy

and various wireless carriers around the world, although the company said it has

an exclusive deal with Verizon in the United States.



HOME, BUT NOT ALONE



Like the Pixel phones, the "Home" device uses Google's digital "Assistant"

service, a voice-activated personal butler that can search the internet, play

music or perform other useful tasks. "Assistant" is the company's answer to

similar concierge services from rivals, including Siri, Amazon's Alexa and

Microsoft's Cortana.



Google said the Home device will sell for roughly $130 online and at electronics

retailers starting next month.



IT'S IN YOUR HEAD



Google's new virtual-reality headset, Daydream View, will differ from other

headsets like Samsung's Gear VR in having a companion motion controller and

compatibility with a wide range of phones, including Pixel.



Daydream View and the controller will be out in November for $79. You'll need a

new Android phone, as existing phones won't have the right hardware.



Google also plans to share design guidelines with other manufacturers to make

Daydream headsets and controllers.
