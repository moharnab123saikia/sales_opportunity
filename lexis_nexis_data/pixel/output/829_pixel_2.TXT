Assignee:  Google Inc. (Mountain View, CA)

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Methods and systems are provided allowing for background identification in
video images. A computer-implemented image processing method includes:
receiving, using at least one processing circuit, a plurality of image frames of
a video; constructing, using at least one processing circuit, a plurality of
statistical models of the plurality of image frames at a plurality of pixel
granularity levels; constructing, using at least one processing circuit, a
plurality of probabilistic models of an input image frame at a plurality of
channel granularity levels based on the plurality of statistical models; merging
at least some of the plurality of probabilistic models based on a weighted
average to form a single probability image; and determining background pixels,
based on a probability threshold value, from the single probability image."

The patent was filed on November 1, 2013 Application no. 14/070,412
