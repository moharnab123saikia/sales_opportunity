Inventors:  Carpenter; Thor (Snoqualmie, WA)

Assignee:  Google Inc. (Mountain View, CA)



According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:

"Methods and systems are provided allowing for background identification in

video images. A computer-implemented image processing method includes:

receiving, using at least one processing circuit, a plurality of image frames of

a video; constructing, using at least one processing circuit, a plurality of

statistical models of the plurality of image frames at a plurality of pixel

granularity levels; constructing, using at least one processing circuit, a

plurality of probabilistic models of an input image frame at a plurality of

channel granularity levels based on the plurality of statistical models; merging

at least some of the plurality of probabilistic models based on a weighted

average to form a single probability image; and determining background pixels,

based on a probability threshold value, from the single probability image."



The patent was filed on November 1, 2013 Application no. 14/070,412
