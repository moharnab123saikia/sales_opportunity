Bangladesh, Dec. 9 -- Google jumps on the premium tablet bandwagon with its
first Android tablet called Google Pixel C. Being a hybrid tablet (means you can
attach a keyboard to it), Pixel C brings together the benefit of a full-size
keyboard with the portability of a tablet. Running on Andropid 6.0 Marshmallow
operating system, Pixel C comes with a 10.2 inches display with a resolution of
2,560x1,800 pixel. The tablet has two storage options -- 32 and 64 GB, and has a
maximum battery life of 10+ hours. Keyboard for the Google Pixel C is optional,
which means you have to shell out additional $150 if you want to attach a
keyboard to your tablet and turn into a laptop- like platform for productivity
purposes. Google Pixel C starts at USD $500 on Google store.
