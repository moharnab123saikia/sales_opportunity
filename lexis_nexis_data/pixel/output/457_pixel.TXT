luck on Nexus 5X and 6P too.

With the launch of new Pixel smartphones, Google has reportedly revamped the
Phone app to version 5.1, which was discovered by Android Police from a batch of
Pixel system image files that were leaked earlier this week.

Speaking about the new updated Phone app, Google has introduced new in-call user
interface which seems to be pretty much identical to the company's Duo video
calling app that was recently launched.

With a translucent blue screen and new actions to answer and reject calls, the
new app redesign further makes the app look more like an iOS dialler. It also
gets new larger buttons and circular caller ID.

Along with this, the new version of the Phone app comes with launcher shortcuts,
which is actually an exclusive feature available on Pixel Launcher. However,
some reports have surfaced online where people have claimed that the new Phone
5.1 app works on Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones, at least those that run on Android
6.0 Marshmallow.

If this story interests you and if you would like to try out the Google Phone
5.1 app yourself right now, you can download the app from APKMirror and try your
luck.
