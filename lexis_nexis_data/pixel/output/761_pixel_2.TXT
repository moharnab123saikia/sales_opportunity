According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "In

some instances, an image may have dimensions that do not correspond to a slot to

display the image. For example, an image content item may have dimensions that

do not correspond to a content item slot. The image may be resized using seam

carving to add or remove pixels of the image. A saliency map for the image may

be used having saliency scores for each pixel of the image. Evaluation metrics

may be used before, during, and after, seam carving to determine whether salient

content is affected by the seam carving. In some instances, a seam cost

threshold value may be used for adaptive step size during the seam carving. The

resized image may then be outputted, such as for an image content item to be

served with a resource."



The Patent was filed on October 17, 2014 under application No. 20150036947
