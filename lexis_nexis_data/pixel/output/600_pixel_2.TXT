Look out for Google's new router

Cheap and packed with features



Are you looking for a new router? Well, how about one from Google?



According to recent rumors, Google is all set to launch a brand new router on

its launch event on the 4th of October, which is quite odd, as Google already

makes the OnHub router. However, this new router, dubbed Google Wifi, is set to

be much cheaper and will cost just $129, which is cheaper than the $179 for the

OnHub. Apart from the price, the router will also be capable of connecting

multiple access points and turn them into a one giant wireless network.



This network will link different  networks together so they blanket an entire

home in a single super network. Routers like the eero already do this, but a

single eero costs $199 (about £155, AU$265), or $499 (about £385, AU$655) for a

pack of three. Additionally, this router is also rumored to have some smart

features and enhanced range over other routers.



Google is also set to reveal the price of its Google Home hub at $129, a new 4K

Chromecast Ultra, and the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones next month.
