Google picks a date to launch Pixel phones



LENGTH: 184  words





We might just see the new Pixel and Pixel XL next month



Google is reportedly set to hold a press conference on October 4th, where it is

rumored to launch two new phones, which could potentially be the new Pixel and

Pixel XL.



If rumors are true, we might just see the replacements for the Nexus lineup at

the event to be held in San Francisco which starts at 9am PST, 12pm EST or 5pm

BST on October 4th, which will also be livestreamed on YouTube. The rumors come

from a new leak for an invite which teases a phone silhouette which acts as a

window to various scenes, potentially hinting at a focus on VR. We might also

learn that HTC is officially behind the new pair of phones as well.



HTC also just launched the HTC 10 and the Desire 10, but it is set to top every

other smartphone with the debut of the Snapdragon 821 processor, which is

already in the Asus ZenFone 3 Deluxe. However, the focus of this new processor

will be on VR as part of Google's Daydream VR project set to debut in the Pixel

and Pixel XL.



These are just speculations for now, and we will know for sure at the event on

October 4th.
