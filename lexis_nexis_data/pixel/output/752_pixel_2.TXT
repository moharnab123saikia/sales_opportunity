

OPTUS has taken the wraps off Google's first mobile phone - but the HTC Dream
could turn into a nightmare for the telco.

Experts say the highly anticipated phone, built by Taiwan brand HTC, will not
take sales away from Apple's popular iPhone 3G, despite having some amazing new
features.

What could be even more depressing for Optus are internet reports that the first
version of the HTC Dream (also called the G1) could be outdated by a series 2
Google mobile that could be unveiled in the U.S. as early as May.

Technology expert Alex Zaharov-Reutt said the deadline for all new smart phones
would be June.

``Everyone is trying to go to market before or at the same time Apple announces
its new iPhone model, which has been June for the last two years,'' Mr
Zaharov-Reutt said.

``So I'd expect we'd see Google's updated Dream phone, rumoured to be called the
G2, in Australia in the lead-up to Christmas.''

On paper the HTC Dream boasts an impressive list of features, headed by Google's
Android open-source operating system. But this will mean little to the man in
the street.

Peter Blasina, The Gadget Guy, said: ``The Dream, like the Blackberry, appeals
to Google fans and soccer mums. It's a great little organiser and has all of
Google's internet tools and functionality built into it.

``But the iPhone will remain more of an emotional purchase and more of an
entertainment device that appeals to a market that looks for something cool.''

Stylistically, the new HTC Dream G1 is not as slinky as the iPhone, and its
interface is not as responsive or as friendly. Applications include YouTube,
Google Talk, Gmail and Maps.

The Optus HTC Dream is available on four 24-month plans from $59 a month.
