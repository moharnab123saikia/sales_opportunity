into tourist cruisers on the Thames. Google claims its new mapping site shows
the entire world in detail - as these images from it prove.

The pictures, taken from a satellite 450km above the earth and planes flying at
low altitude over major cities, are claimed to be the most detailed posted on
the internet.

"Areas are covered at different resolutions," said a Google spokesman.

"The resolution varies from 1km per pixel, where a single pixel in the image
covers an area of 1km, to 15cm per pixel.

"At the lowest resolution, large geographic features such as mountains and lakes
are visible, and at the highest resolution detailed features of the earth such
as buildings and cars can be seen."

Visitors to maps.google.com enter a postcode or type in the name of the landmark
they want to see. The site can even show drivers a route with satellite
photographs revealing exactly where to go. New pictures are taken every 18
months to keep the site up to date.

In future, the images could be used to help plan your summer holiday.

Several travel websites are working on how to incorporate satellite pictures so
that people booking a foreign hotel can check beforehand whether it really is
just a stone's throw from the beach.
