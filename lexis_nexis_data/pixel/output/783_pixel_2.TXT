IT can give you a bird's eye view of the gardens at Buckingham Palace and look

into tourist cruisers on the Thames. Google claims its new mapping site shows

the entire world in detail - as these images from it prove.



The pictures, taken from a satellite 450km above the earth and planes flying at

low altitude over major cities, are claimed to be the most detailed posted on

the internet.



"Areas are covered at different resolutions," said a Google spokesman.



"The resolution varies from 1km per pixel, where a single pixel in the image

covers an area of 1km, to 15cm per pixel.



"At the lowest resolution, large geographic features such as mountains and lakes

are visible, and at the highest resolution detailed features of the earth such

as buildings and cars can be seen."



Visitors to maps.google.com enter a postcode or type in the name of the landmark

they want to see. The site can even show drivers a route with satellite

photographs revealing exactly where to go. New pictures are taken every 18

months to keep the site up to date.



In future, the images could be used to help plan your summer holiday.



Several travel websites are working on how to incorporate satellite pictures so

that people booking a foreign hotel can check beforehand whether it really is

just a stone's throw from the beach.
