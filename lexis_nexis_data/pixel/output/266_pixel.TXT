Phones built in-house to take on market

HIGHLIGHT:Â This new mobile phone is 100% Google





AFTER the headphone jack-less launch of the iPhone 7 and the explosive

tendencies of the Samsung Note 7, people may be out looking for an alternative

to the big two phone makers.



Fortunately, now, Google has taken what it's learned during its Nexus program

and begun building both the software and hardware for a new series of phones

in-house.



Welcome to the Google Pixel, a label some would already be familiar with if

you'd used Google's Chromebooks.



Where Google's previous Nexus phones were strictly Google-only affairs on the

software side, representing the cleanest Android boot you could find, they were

all built by external partners like LG.



The Pixel phone, launched last week, is Google's first attempt at controlling

the entire construction process.



The Pixel comes in two sizes. One comes with a 5-inch screen, making it slightly

larger than the iPhone 7, while the other comes with a 5.5-inch screen the same

size as the larger iPhone but smaller than Samsung's Note 7.



Both use the same 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for the front screen and the

glass on the back, meaning it's going to look and feel great all around, even if

you don't put a case on it. On the back is also Google's fingerprint sensor

which can be swiped to unlock your phone or access notifications.



The Pixel's camera is, according to benchmarking service, DxOMark, the best one

currently strapped to a mobile, beating out the Galaxy S7 Edge, HTC 10, and the

Sony Xperia X Performance.



The camera's an impressive 12.3MP unit with an f/2.0 aperture and chunky 1.55

micron pixels.



Given the fantastic performance we saw when reviewing the iPhone 7's new camera,

we're keen to see how this on-paper dominance might translate into real-world

performance if it does at all.



Being a Google phone, software is key. It ships with the latest version of

Android 7.1 Nougat and like the Nexus phones before it, will receive updates

directly when they're available, not so much when your carrier decides to let

them through. Unless you buy it on contract.



Also freshly installed are Google's new communications apps, Duo and Allo,

competition to iOS's facetime and iMessage suite. While Allo doesn't focus quite

as heavily on allowing enormous stickers to become core parts of its

functionality like our recent app reviews might indicate, it's a full-blooded

messager all the same.



What's more important is that Google's Assistant, the competitor to Siri and

Cortana, is connected to everything on this phone, giving it an edge to really

shine. The Pixel is available for pre-order from both JB Hi-Fi and Telstra here

in Australia, with prices starting at $1079 for the 32gb 5" to $1419 for the

128GB 5.5". Telstra prices are part of a contract so may vary.



Comes in Very Silver and Quite Black, but no Really Blue for us Aussies.
