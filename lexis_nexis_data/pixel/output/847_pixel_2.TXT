Google PlaNet trained to identify locations where photos were taken based on

visual cues

Computer specialist Tobias Weyand and his colleagues at Google have come up with

a deep-learning platform codenamed PlaNet. They have trained the system to

figure out locations where pictures have been captured on the basis of visual

cues. The project is interesting and it has showcased amazingly high degree of

accuracy in detecting places where images were taken. The system is improving

with time, said Google research team member Weyand.



The specialists at Google began by dividing up the globe into a grid, leaving

aside the oceans and polar region. MIT Technology Review reported that

thereafter, they formed a database for PlaNet, containing 126 million

geo-located pictures taken from the Internet.



PlaNet is an artificial neural network, thus it can learn. So the experts taught

the network how to recognize a picture's location on the grid only with the help

of information present in the pixels.



For testing the accuracy of PlaNet, Weyand and his team fed it 2.3 million

geo-tagged Flickr pictures. Then, PlaNet lessened 48% of them to the right

continent, 28.4% to the right country, 10.1% to the right city, and 3.6% to the

real street.



With further improvement, PlaNet can exactly locate every single random picture

on a map, however, it has to consider many other factors and pixels in pictures.

In some cases, the system makes wrong guess about location.



Though the findings might not seem all that great initially, they became

extraordinary when the tech giant team pitted their machine opposed to 10 smart,

well-traveled humans. The machine managed to win over 50% of the rounds and had

better accuracy.



The team wrote in their abstract regarding the system, "PlaNet outperforms

previous approaches and even attains superhuman levels of accuracy in some

cases".



According to the team, PlaNet doesn't need a lot of memory, either. MIT

Technology Review reported that the model uses just 377 MB, which means it could

be easily loaded on a smartphone.



PlaNet has distinct abilities, and it could end up being like a Shazam for

picture locations. A user can run, Carmen Sandiego, but can't stay out of sight

of the Google machine.



A report published in the TheVerge said, Google's latest deep-learning program

can figure out where a photo was taken just by looking at it. The program,

called PlaNet, was trained to recognize locations based on details in a photo by

looking at over 90 million geotagged images taken from the internet. That means,

for instance, that PlaNet can determine a particular photo was taken in Paris

because it recognizes the Eiffel Tower.



But most humans can do that too. What sets PlaNet apart is that it can use its

deep-learning techniques to determine the locations of photos without

distinctive landmarks, like the random roads and houses below.



"One would expect that these cues, especially street signs, together with world

knowledge and common sense, should give humans an unfair advantage over PlaNet,

which was trained solely on image pixels and geolocations. Yet PlaNet was able

to outperform humans by a considerable margin," the researchers boast,"

according to a news report published by ZDNet.



To improve its geolocation abilities even further, for images that lack

sufficient visual cues, the researchers trained the machine to do 'sequence

location' -- that is, exploiting the way photos are often taken in sequences and

so the system uses entire photo albums.



In a report published by the Discovery, "PlaNet outperforms previous approaches

and even attains superhuman levels of accuracy in some cases," the team wrote in

their abstract about the machine. You can test your own abilities with online

games like GeoGuessr. Might want to set an alarm first, though, because that one

is kind of addictive.



I remember trying out Google Googles several years ago and quickly realized it

was mostly limited to displaying info about well-known places. PlaNet has

different potential. The technology could end up being like a Shazam for photo

locations. You can run, Carmen Sandiego, but you can't hide from the Google

machine.
