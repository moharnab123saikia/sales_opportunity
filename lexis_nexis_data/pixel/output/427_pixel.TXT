We might see this snapper on the next HTC made Pixel phones



Once the iPhone hype is all over, everyone will be looking at the upcoming Pixel

branded flagship phones from Google, and we have some juicy details of the

camera lens to expect in the devices.



The two phones are made by HTC and is set to launch in October. According to a

recent leak, both the phones will be rocking aÂ Sony IM378 sensor in the main

rear camera and an IMX179 sensor on the front, which will be a 12MP and 8MP

respectively.



These rumors tie in to previous rumors about the two Pixel (Nexus) devices, set

to come with Android 7.0 Nougat. Sure, camera quality is more important than the

number of megapixels, but this is a significant upgrade from last years Nexus 6P

and 5X.



Along with these two new phones, we are also expected to see the debut of

Google's Daydream VR headset and Google Home as well, plus (possibly) a 4K

Chromecast.
