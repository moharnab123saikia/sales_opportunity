users, throwing down a gauntlet for Apple and its MacBooks.

Google said its Chromebook Pixel computers blending tablet and laptop
technology, boasting heavyweight Intel chips and screens tailored for rich
graphics were released in the US and Britain.

``People will give up a MacBook Air for this,'' Chrome senior vice-president
Sundar Pichai said while showing off the premium end of what, to now, were
low-priced notebook computers that serve as windows to internet-based services.

A Pixel model featuring built-in connectivity to Verizon mobile internet service
will hit the market in April in the US, according to Google.

The version available on Thursday allowed connections to the internet with
wireless hot-spot technology or cables.

``It's a great-looking product,'' Om Malik of technology news website GigaOm
said at the Pixel debut in San Francisco.

``But Google is facing a selling problem; they have to compete on price
originally and build a developer base for a high-end product.''

Google hoped people look beyond comparing Pixel prices with competitors such as
MacBooks or laptops built on Windows 8 software to see the value the
touch-screen and the massive terabyte of Google Drive online data storage
included.
