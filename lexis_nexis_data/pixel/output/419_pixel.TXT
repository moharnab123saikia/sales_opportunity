According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "In
some implementations, a method includes identifying one or more face regions of
an image, the face regions including pixels that depict at least a portion of
one or more faces of persons. The face regions are identified based on
identifying facial landmarks of the faces. The method determines an associated
face mask for each of the faces based on the face regions, where each face mask
indicates which pixels in the image depict the corresponding face. Face pixels
can be selected for processing by applying the face masks, and image pixels
outside the faces can be selected by inversely applying the face masks. The
selected pixels can be provided to a processing operation for adjustment of the
selected pixels."

The Patent was filed on May 14, 2013 under application No. 20140341442
