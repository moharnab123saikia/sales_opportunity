According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "In

some implementations, a method includes identifying one or more face regions of

an image, the face regions including pixels that depict at least a portion of

one or more faces of persons. The face regions are identified based on

identifying facial landmarks of the faces. The method determines an associated

face mask for each of the faces based on the face regions, where each face mask

indicates which pixels in the image depict the corresponding face. Face pixels

can be selected for processing by applying the face masks, and image pixels

outside the faces can be selected by inversely applying the face masks. The

selected pixels can be provided to a processing operation for adjustment of the

selected pixels."



The Patent was filed on May 14, 2013 under application No. 20140341442
