Issac, a member of Google's camera team has recently explained that this can be

solved via an algorithm that can recognize the flare, and subtract it from the

image.



Google Pixel smartphone users have been lately reporting that the phone's camera

is more susceptible to lens flare, which is more commonly seen as a contrast arc

in one of the corners caused due to sun or a light source hitting the camera

lens at a specific angle.



While this is in-fact seen in almost all cameras, many Redditors seem to have

been demanding Google to send out a fix claiming that the frequency of lens

flares in Pixel's camera is a little more.



In a reply to one such post, Isaac Reynolds, popularly known as IsaacOnCamera, a

member of Google's camera team has given an explanation as to why it is

happening. He has also mentioned that Pixel users can expect an update for this

issue pretty soon as this can solved via a software update.



Here's a screenshot of Isaac's complete reply to the post:



As you can see, Isaac has mentioned that the Pixel's camera's lens structure is

very highly controlled which actually means that all Pixels take high quality

images, and thus, all Pixels have the same flare characteristics.



He has added further information stating that, a software update is being worked

upon by Google where some algorithms will recognize the halo/arc flare,

characterize it mathematically, and then subtract it from the image, thereby

solving this issue.
