United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patent no. 8,670,630, on
March 11, 2014, to Google Inc (California), titled as "Fast randomized
multi-scale energy minimization for image processing"

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "An
image processing module performs efficient image enhancement according to a
multi-scale energy minimization process. One or more input images are
progressively downsampled to generate a pyramid of downsampled images of varying
resolution. Starting with the coarsest downsampled image, a label map is
generated that maps output pixel positions to pixel positions in the downsampled
input images. The label map is then progressively upsampled. At each upsampling
stage, the labels are refined according to an energy function configured to
produce the desired enhancements. Using the multi-scale energy minimization, the
image processing module enhances image via hole-filling and/or
super-resolution."

The patent was filed on December 1, 2011 Application no. 13/308,836
