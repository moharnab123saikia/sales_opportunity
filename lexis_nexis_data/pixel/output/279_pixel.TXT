New Delhi, June 29 -- Google Maps is probably one of the most useful apps you

have on your phone. It's accurate and provides you with great images when you

have to search for places.





 Now, Google has decided to treat Google Maps users to an imagery upgrade! Yes,

you heard that right!

 Say hello to fresh, high resolution, high definition images coming to you

directly from Landsat 8 satellite. The earlier version used Landsat 7.

 In a blog post, Google says that to obtain such images, it looked at millions

of imaging and used new processing techniques to come up with the new

cloud-free, seamless version.

 According to Google, Landsat 8 is capable of capturing twice as many images as

Landsat 7 does every day.

 In the blog post, Google wrote, "Like our previous mosaic, we mined data from

nearly a petabyte of Landsat imagery-that's more than 700 trillion individual

pixels-to choose the best cloud-free pixels. To put that in perspective, 700

trillion pixels is 7,000 times more pixels than the estimated number of stars in

the Milky Way Galaxy, or 70 times more pixels than the estimated number of

galaxies in the Universe."

 Landsat 8 is an American Earth observation satellite that was launched in

February 2013. It is the eighth satellite in the Landsat program and the seventh

to make it to the orbit successfully.

 The new imagery is now available across all Google mapping products.
