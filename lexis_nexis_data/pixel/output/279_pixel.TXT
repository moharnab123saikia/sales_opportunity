New Delhi, June 29 -- Google Maps is probably one of the most useful apps you
have on your phone. It's accurate and provides you with great images when you
have to search for places.


 Now, Google has decided to treat Google Maps users to an imagery upgrade! Yes,
you heard that right!
 Say hello to fresh, high resolution, high definition images coming to you
directly from Landsat 8 satellite. The earlier version used Landsat 7.
 In a blog post, Google says that to obtain such images, it looked at millions
of imaging and used new processing techniques to come up with the new
cloud-free, seamless version.
 According to Google, Landsat 8 is capable of capturing twice as many images as
Landsat 7 does every day.
 In the blog post, Google wrote, "Like our previous mosaic, we mined data from
nearly a petabyte of Landsat imagery-that's more than 700 trillion individual
pixels-to choose the best cloud-free pixels. To put that in perspective, 700
trillion pixels is 7,000 times more pixels than the estimated number of stars in
the Milky Way Galaxy, or 70 times more pixels than the estimated number of
galaxies in the Universe."
 Landsat 8 is an American Earth observation satellite that was launched in
February 2013. It is the eighth satellite in the Landsat program and the seventh
to make it to the orbit successfully.
 The new imagery is now available across all Google mapping products.
