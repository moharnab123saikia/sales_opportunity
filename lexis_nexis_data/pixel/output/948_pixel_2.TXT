What will this year's must-have device be? Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson reports



GADGETS just get better and more desirable every year. Who, in 2006, would have

predicted that iPods would make phone calls, cheap laptops would be the size of

books and mobile phones would be directing us through traffic?



Yet even more seemingly unfathomable technological breakthroughs will be made

this year, with a new wave of creations on the horizon.



Some of the top entertainment and technology firms have already foreshadowed big

releases, while trends will force others to think on their feet and produce

amazing gadgetry to enhance our lives.



We've peeked at their plans, extrapolated others and report below on what looks

like a promising year.



The Google phone



THOUGHT the Apple iPhone was exciting? What about a mobile phone from web giant

Google?



We don't know what it will look like yet, but Google reportedly showed a

prototype of the so-called Google phone dubbed "Dream'' to interested companies

in August last year.



Taiwanese mobile phone company HTC is collaborating with Google on the project,

and HTC chief marketing officer John Wang said the phone would be released

mid-year.



What is known is that any Google phone would feature access to Google's search

engine and web applications and make mobile web surfing second nature.



Apple iPhone in Australia



WHEN will it get here, who will sell it and why isn't it here already?



Apple single-handedly shook up the mobile phone market last year with the launch

of its iPhone handset, left. But more than six months on, the revolutionary

mobile phone is still only travelling to Australia via American relatives,

tourists and eBay. Apple even instructed Australian resellers not to support the

iPhone in an attempt to stem the grey market trade.



For those who missed the hype, the iPhone won praise for its 3.5in touch-screen

and its phone, iPod, camera, video and photo capabilities.



So when will it finally get here? An Apple spokeswoman says it is expected

``some time in 2008'' but Australia's big five mobile phone companies have yet

to announce a deal with Apple.



Apple CEO Steve Jobs said Apple was also working on a 3G version of the iPhone,

with an acceptable battery for the device due late this year, though it is

likely Australia will get the 2.5G version first.



Digital radio



RADIO fans already have their choice of listening to AM, FM or internet

stations, but what about the ability to rewind and pause live broadcasts, tune

into dedicated concert, competition and traffic stations and read song titles

from a radio's screen?



All of these things will be possible with digital radio, below, due to launch in

Australia this year.



Australian radio stations have been testing the technology since 1999, with

active trials in Sydney for some time. But with plans under way to launch the

technology in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart on January

1, 2009, experts are tipping broadcasts to begin late this year.



You will need a new radio to tune into the digital broadcasts, but it should be

worth the investment. Radio stations will be able to beam text or images such as

traffic maps to your radio screen, will be able to offer more than one channel

each, and reception will be clear.



High-definition everything



THOUGHT high-definition was big in 2007? Expect to hear that term more than ever

this year.



Television stations are broadcasting it, Foxtel is plotting to release it and

more DVDs and flat-panel television screens will boast full high-definition

resolution for less money in 2008.



High-definition simply refers to video with a greater number of pixels, making

images sharper and more lifelike.



Full high-definition video features 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels, progressively

scanned. As a guide, this means high-definition DVDs feature five times the

detail of regular DVDs.



But buying full HD technology has been confusing, with some consumers buying

products with lower specifications by accident. That should be helped this year

with the introduction of a logo (a tick) to certify a product delivers full

high-definition vision.



Education campaigns by the free-to-air channels, which all offer HD broadcasts

now, will also help, as will the campaign by Foxtel preparing for its mid-2008

launch of four HD channels.



As for high-definition DVDs, the war between the Blu-ray and HD-DVD formats is

still raging, though Blu-ray is clearly winning the battle in Australia.



If a format does not claim ultimate victory soon, we may see the emergence of

another technology to rule them all.



Warner Bros has developed a technology called Total HD, which allows a DVD to

feature Blu-ray content on one side, and HD-DVD content on the other. The

company has yet to release the technology though, perhaps as it waits to see

whether the war will end in the near future.



TiVo



IT HELPS millions of Americans skip TV commercials and find new shows to watch

daily and it's coming to Australia.



TiVo, above, is a digital video recorder launched in the US in 1999 that lets

users record TV shows to a hard drive, like a computer, so they can pause or

rewind live broadcasts or simply save shows for later.



The set-top box, popularised in shows such as Sex and The City, also lets users

record entire TV show seasons or any shows featuring a certain actor, and

suggests TV shows a user might like based on their preferences.



While Foxtel's digital video recorder, the iQ, is leading the DVR pack in

Australia, Channel 7 plans to shake things up in 2008 after doing a deal with

TiVo to bring the device to Australia and New Zealand.



It's not yet clear how the Australian TiVo will work. Its success will depend on

whether Seven can secure TV guides for Foxtel programming and that of its

free-to-air rivals, but this is a gadget with great promise.



Roaming internet



WANT to get broadband at home but don't want to pay for a phone line connection?

Mobile phone companies have recognised this problem and are making mobile

broadband a lot more attractive.



Don't think this means huddling around your mobile phone and typing emails with

a numeric keypad. All five mobile phone companies now offer internet plans that

use mobile phone networks and connect to your PC.



For example, 3 Mobile is enticing customers with a free USB modem and 1GB of

downloads for $14.50 a month, while Vodafone recently launched its offer of a

free USB modem, right, with 5GB of downloads a month for $39.



You can also use these mobile modems when travelling, making them handy gadgets.

Expect to see greater competition this year as phone companies vie for the

growing laptop-toting market, and more travellers' faces buried in laptops at

cafes, airports, hotels and everywhere in between.



eBooks



AMAZON launched its big eBook hope, the Kindle, late last year and Australian

bookseller Dymocks followed shortly afterwards with its electronic reading

device, the iLiad.



Like a portable computer, an eBook reader displays text on its screen and lets

you flip pages, make notes, save bookmarks, look up words in its dictionary and

even download new titles. However, its screen is more like a printed page than a

flickering computer screen, making it easier on the eyes and the gadget's

battery.



These eBook readers are far from mainstream at the moment, with the Kindle

launched in the US for $US399 ($455) and the iLiad, bottom right, retailing for

a whopping $899 in Dymocks, but with increased support in the form of cheap book

downloads and a growing library of titles, the eBook has the potential to find a

market this year.



PlayStation Home



SONY'S PlayStation 3, top right, is one highly capable games console, able to

entertain you with games, videos, photos, music, the web, downloads and more.

But one thing it was due to boast by now is a virtual online community.

PlayStation Home has been in development since 2005. Each user represents

themself with an avatar and, like Second Life, users can then roam virtual

environments, making virtual friends and enemies as they talk to others via text

or voice chat, and even share music.



PlayStation Home will also have places of interest such as virtual movie

theatres and shopping malls, as well as players' houses which they can decorate

as they wish.



Beta testing for this new community is due to begin in the first quarter of this

year, so PlayStation 3 users should keep their eyes peeled and controllers

poised.



GPS phones



IF YOU missed out on the GPS phone, above, trend last year, you will be given

plenty of chances to catch up in 2008.



Nokia already wowed us with the new Nokia N95 8GB in December -- a faster,

sexier version of its breakthrough navigating phone with an added 8GB memory

inside. But the company has more on the cards for this year.



Recently revealed in Finland, the N82 mobile phone is due to arrive early this

year. It is a sleek, silver candybar phone with raised buttons and a 2.4in

screen. More importantly, it also boasts a 5-megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss

lens, autofocus and Xenon flash, Assisted GPS navigation, an MP3 player, wi-fi,

Bluetooth, FM radio and HSDPA connectivity.



It won't be the only GPS-enabled mobile phone launched this year, but reports so

far indicate it might be one of the smallest and the slickest.



Green gadgets



GREEN has certainly become the new black, with everyone from celebrities to

corporations supporting the call for cleaner, more efficient and more

Earth-friendly technology and practices. Expect to see that trend affect more

gadgets this year, in many ways.



Nokia, for example, will launch 3110 Evolve, above left, a phone featuring a

cover made largely of renewable materials, and coming with an energy-efficient

charger and packing that is 60 per cent recyclable. Fujitsu will introduce a

laptop with a plastic case made from corn.



You should also expect to see many more technology recycling campaigns aimed at

reusing parts of discarded mobile phones, computers and other electronics. A

growing list of programs is available at the Planet Ark website

RecyclingNearYou.com.au.
