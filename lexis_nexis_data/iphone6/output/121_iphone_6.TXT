APPLE said it would roll out the iPhone 6 in 36 new markets, including China and

South Africa, by the end of the month.



The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be available in 69 countries and territories

before the start of November in what Apple is calling its fastest rollout ever.



On Friday, the iPhone will become available in China, India and Monaco. Next

week, the iPhone will roll out in Israel, Poland and the Czech Republic, among

others.



The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus went on sale in 10 countries on September 19. In

its first weekend of availability, Apple said it sold more than 10 million amid

significant supply shortages and demand for scalped iPhones in Asia.



Apple said the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus set a record for first-weekend iPhone

sales, eclipsing last year's mark of 9 million units when the iPhone 5S and

iPhone 5C went on sale.The company is expected to give an update on iPhone sales

when it reports results for the quarter ended September, on October 20.
