So the iPhone 6 is coming to India before Diwali afterall. It is reliably learnt

that Apple resellers here are expecting to start sales of the Apple iPhone 6

16GB by October 18 at a price of around Rs 55,000.



Previously, the market had speculated that the iPhone 6 will not be available in

India before Diwali and they might miss out on festive sales. However, retailers

are now preparing to sell the phone just before Diwali.



An executive at Apple Premium Reseller Imagine Store in New Delhi said the

iPhone 6 will be available in their stores by October 18 or 19, priced between

Rs 55,000 and Rs 60,000 for the 16GB model.



Another executive at Apple Premium Reseller iPlanet, with operations in

Coimbatore, Mysore and Bengaluru, also confirmed the dates. However, iPlanet did

not reveal the price bracket the phone will come in.



Meanwhile, cross-border e-commerce player Grabmore.in has started taking

pre-orders for the iPhone 6 from Indian customer before the launch and claims to

have delivered many units in India till now after the smartphone was made

available in the US.



"We had already delivered many units to our customers in India within four to

five days of the launch. However, due to the huge demand in the US, the delivery

of pending bookings along with new orders will be done by end of October or

early November," said Satish Das, Executive Director, Grabmore.



Grabmore.in had initially priced the iPhone 6 16 GB at Rs. 61,999. Later, they

updated it to Rs. 54,999. It is shipping from the US itself with one-year global

warranty.



"We are offering the unlocked iPhone 6 16 GB model which was launched in the US

to our Indian customers at a price of Rs. 54,999 now. We are expecting it to be

available locally by October 17 or 18. If this happens we will deliver the

locally available iPhone 6 handsets, instead of the imported version. The iPhone

6 16 GB price in India is expected to be close to around Rs. 55,000. If the

price at which we are selling happens to more than the local price then we will

surely refund the excess amount," said Das.



The market had also speculated that the iPhone 6 Plus will arrive along with the

iPhone 6 and would be available at a starting price of around Rs. 65,000 to Rs.

70,000. However, it is quite possible that the iPhone 6 Plus may not be

available in India now. "The iPhone 6 Plus will take some time to arrive as the

supply is pretty slow. We are offering the imported version of the iPhone 6 Plus

16 GB for Rs 59,999. We are expecting the iPhone 6 Plus to be priced around Rs

60,000," added Das.
