Ram Agrawal, a Class X student, paid premium to a city dealer so that he got it

when official Apple store opened in US



Ahmedabad: There seems to be one more reason to believe that Amdavadis are tech

savvy and brand-crazy, as Ram Agrawal, a Class X student, became the first owner

of iPhone 6 in India exactly when it was being launched in the US on Friday. He

claims that he got hold of the phone even before it reached tech-crazy Apple

fans in the US.



Agrawal says he was always an ardent Apple fan and would always buy the latest

versions of the phone ever since he was in Class II. Sharing his new-found joy,

he said, "I have already posted my photos posing with iPhone 6 on Facebook, and

my friends are surprised. I bought the phone paying more than the actual market

price, but I feel it's worth the product."



The dealer who got iPhone 6 for him says that he delivered the phone to Agrawal

on Friday at around 9 pm (which was 8:30 am in San Francisco, USA, where Apple's

official store is located). He added that Agrawal was so eager to have the phone

that he won't accept even an hour's delay.



Officially, iPhone 6 is set to launch in India in October, but it is already

available in grey market at premium price.



Agrawal's previous mobile phone was an iPhone 5S. He adds, "I have been buying

iPhones for many years now, and would continue to do so whenever the latest

iPhone hits the market. This is my eighth iPhone." He is passionate about the

latest gadgets and plans to pursue a career in information technology.



Agrawal's iPhone 6 is a space-grey coloured model, with 116GB memory. He,

however, refused to disclose the actual amount he paid for the phone.



When asked if the latest acquisition would hamper his studies, he said, "I am

sure it will not, since I don't plan to carry it to the school."
