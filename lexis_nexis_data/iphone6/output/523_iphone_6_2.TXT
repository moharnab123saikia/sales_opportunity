LENGTH: 215  words





Before Apple launches the Iphone 6 this year in September, Iphone 6 has leaked

again. This time the leakster Feld & Volk posted picture of the upcoming iPhone

6 on Instagram.



The picture posted shows that the new phone will sport the fingerprint scanner

embedded in the hard key (home button) and the RIM of the phone will not be

flat, but curved like the Galaxy phones.



In few more pictures posted by the leakster (via MacRumors) more of the side

profile of the iPhone 6 is revealed. The typical rounded buttons of the iPhone

have turned slightly rectangular like that in Galaxy phones. This seems to match

the earlier leak (leaked again via the French site Nowhereelse and protective

shells to be marketed by Chinese prop by Nowhereelse again) that revealed Galaxy

phones like buttons on the upcoming iPhone 6.



MacRumours comment that the product leaked by Feld and Volk looks like an

"unfinished iPhone 6" with parts that are in rough condition. Once polished they

will look even and smooth.



The iPhone 6 is rumoured use thinner battery, A8 processor, a prepped up camera

with new features, more than a dozen of sensors and the all new iOS 8 operating

system. This new operating system revealed by Apple this year at the WorldWide

Developers Conference sports some new interesting features.
