last month, defying the historical trend of a sales slump ahead of the new
devices release, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel.

The iPhone 5C was the best selling smartphone in the UK during August, with 8.9
per cent share of sales.

It outsold the flagship iPhone 5s with 7.6 per cent and the Samsung Galaxy S5
with six per cent, all despite the imminent arrival of the iPhone 6.
"Historically in the month before a new iPhone is released, we see a drop in
sales share for Apple as users hold out for the new model," said Kantar
Worldpanel ComTech strategic insight director Dominic Sunnebo. "However, Apple
has managed to limit the drop this year with its share of sales dipping just 1.6
percentage points versus July this year - almost half the equivalent drop seen
in 2013 ahead of the iPhone 5 launch."

Kantar said that of the 13.3m iPhone users in the UK around 4m were due for an
upgrade and 85 per cent planned to buy another iPhone.

Over 10m iPhone 6's were sold during its first three days on sale
