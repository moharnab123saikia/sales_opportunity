Muscat: Ooredoo on Wednesday announced it will offer the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

Plus, the biggest advancements in iPhone history, beginning on November 13, a

statement from Ooredoo said.







Customers can pre-order the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus from Friday November 7 at

www.ooredoo.om/iphone6.



Even as iPhone's 6 series models are not sold by Apple's authorized stores in

Oman, it is available in other local shops who have purchased it from United

Arab Emirates and other countries.



In local stores, the iPhone 6 16GB will cost OMR325, 64GB will cost OMR410 and

128GB will cost OMR430.



Meanwhile, iPhone 6 Plus 16GB will cost OMR350 and 64GB will cost OMR440.



In September, Apple's online store crashed under the weight of demand from eager

customers hoping to pre-order one of the new iPhone 6 models during its launch.



The company had announced it would make pre-orders, but in minutes it had begun

displaying "We'll be back" messages in several languages.



Twitter users reported problems with sites around the world before services

appeared to have been restored after 30 minutes.



According to Apple's official website, the price of iPhone 6 16GB is $199 for US

customers while the iPhone 6 Plus 16GB will be at $299 with a two-year contract.
