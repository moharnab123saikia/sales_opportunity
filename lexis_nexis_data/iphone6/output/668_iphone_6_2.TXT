Apple will be offering free repairs for faulty iPhone 6 Plus camera, due to the

recent complaints that have risen up regarding the blurry images.



Apple has stated that a small percentage of their devices have had a faulty

component which leads to the blurry image problem that is faced by some users.

The iPhone 6 Plus modelsÂ in question were sold primarily between September last

year and January this year. Users can log on to the Apple website where an

online tool can tell you if your device has the faulty parts by entering the

phone's serial number. The online tool also lists nearby authorized sellers or

Apple stores nearby, where the user can drop the phone. Once the phone is

dropped at one of these stores, the users are eligible to a free repair.



The iPhone 6 Plus was released last September along with its sister phone, the

iPhone 6, and were the hottest selling phones during last year and the first

quarter of 2015. The iPhone 6 was renowned for its amazing camera which was also

the prime focus of Apple's 'Shot on iPhone 6' campaign earlier this year.



Apple's iPhone has been a major part of the company's success over the years.

Apple is expected to release the next flagship, Apple iPhone 7, during the IFA

conference coming September.
