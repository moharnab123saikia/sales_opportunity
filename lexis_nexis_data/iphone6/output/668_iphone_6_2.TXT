Apple will be offering free repairs for faulty iPhone 6 Plus camera, due to the
recent complaints that have risen up regarding the blurry images.

Apple has stated that a small percentage of their devices have had a faulty
component which leads to the blurry image problem that is faced by some users.
The iPhone 6 Plus models in question were sold primarily between September last
year and January this year. Users can log on to the Apple website where an
online tool can tell you if your device has the faulty parts by entering the
phone's serial number. The online tool also lists nearby authorized sellers or
Apple stores nearby, where the user can drop the phone. Once the phone is
dropped at one of these stores, the users are eligible to a free repair.

The iPhone 6 Plus was released last September along with its sister phone, the
iPhone 6, and were the hottest selling phones during last year and the first
quarter of 2015. The iPhone 6 was renowned for its amazing camera which was also
the prime focus of Apple's 'Shot on iPhone 6' campaign earlier this year.

Apple's iPhone has been a major part of the company's success over the years.
Apple is expected to release the next flagship, Apple iPhone 7, during the IFA
conference coming September.
