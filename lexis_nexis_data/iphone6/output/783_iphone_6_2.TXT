Business: Top online rumors of latest iPhone



LENGTH: 548  words





Apple Inc is expected to unveil its next-generation iPhone in September. As

usual, rumors have gone viral as unsubstantiated stories constantly swirl around

the Internet.



According to data released by Canalys, a mobile market research firm, one in

three smartphones shipped in China was from Xiaomi Inc or Huawei Technologies Co

Ltd in the second quarter. Apple came in third, followed by Samsung and Vivo.



During the same period, shares of the California kingpin fell 2.36 percent to a

six-month low. The stock also fell below its 200-day moving average for the

first time since September 2013.



UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a note that the "key investment debate is

whether iPhone shipments can grow in fiscal 2016".



Here we feature some of the hot topics to have been discussed online:



Release date

"The new iPhone will go on sale via telecom carrier Vodafone on September 25,"

said UK-based tech website Mobile News, citing a leaked internal e-mail sent

from Vodafone.



According to the e-mail, the operator outlined pre-launch information, including

that they will begin taking pre-orders from September 18.

Taiwan-based Digitimes reports that Apple will adopt 0.4t (with a dimension of

3x0.85x0.4mm) LED chips for its backlight units, in order to make its iPhone

even thinner than the previous generation.



The report suggests that Apple will use 0.4t LED chips from Japan-based Nichia

and Toyoda Gose.



Rose gold, Force Touch

Tech website Apple Insider reported on May 12 that Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI

Securities, who has a solid track record on Apple leaks, issued a new research

note that revealed a number of changes planned for Apple's so-called "iPhone

6s".



He said Apple will offer a new rose gold option, though he didn't indicate how

much the high-end luxury model might cost.



Force Touch, a technology that can enhance user experience due to more input

methods and support of handwritten signatures, will be the biggest upgraded

selling point, but also one of the main bottlenecks in the supply chain.



New Chip

According to 9to5mac.com, one of the main upgrades to the next iPhone's internal

parts will be a redesigned wireless system featuring a new Qualcomm-made LTE

chip.



"The new device will include Qualcomm's MDM9635M chip, also known as the '9X35'

Gobi modem platform," said the report.



This new chip promises significant performance improvements over the "9X25" chip

found inside the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, capable of delivering up to

twice the theoretical LTE download speeds.
