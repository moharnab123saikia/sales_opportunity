TECHNOLOGY



Most iPhone users have the 6



About 52% of U.S. iPhone owners have upgraded to the latest models -- the iPhone

6 or iPhone 6 Plus, nearly twice the global average, according to Consumer

Intelligence Research Partners. Apple CEO Tim Cook last week said 27% of the

iPhone installed base worldwide has moved to iPhone 6 series handsets. In the

U.S., 33 mil iPhone 6 and 17 mil iPhone 6 Plus models are in use, CIRP

estimates. Apple shares fell 1.4% to 122.77.



SECURITY



ADT: Not feeling insecure yet



The home security incumbent has yet to feel threatened by Apple's

"do-it-yourself" HomeKit -- and growth in AT&T's Digital Life and Comcast's

investments in home automation and security may benefit ADT. So says Citigroup

analyst Jason Bazinet, who upgraded ADT stock to buy, with a price target of 39,

because the home security market "has morphed into the "smart home' market." The

big question is how fast the market may shift to a consumer

"do-it-yourself"-type model, said Bazinet. ADT shares rose 1.9% to 31.97.
