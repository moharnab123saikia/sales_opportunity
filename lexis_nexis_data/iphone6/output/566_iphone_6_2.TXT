Paying with mobile devices is about to become even more Priceless. Apple has

unveiled Apple Pay that will enable MasterCard cardholders to use their iPhone

6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch for everyday purchases.





MasterCard built the foundation for secure mobile transactions, so consumers can

use their cards when, where and how they want.

MasterCard worked with Apple to deliver a seamless and secure payment

experience. For consumers and merchants alike, every purchase made with a

MasterCard using iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch will offer the

security, benefits and guarantees of any MasterCard transaction.

Apple Pay transforms mobile payments with an easy, secure, and private way to

make purchases. By integrating Apple hardware, software and services, Apple Pay

creates a "unique and incredibly intuitive" experience for iPhone 6, iPhone 6

Plus and Apple Watch users. Owners of the new iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple

Watch will be able to use their MasterCard credit or debit cards from

participating banks directly through Apple Pay.

At a store, consumers can simply pay by just holding their iPhone near a

contactless reader with their finger on Touch ID and their transaction will be

authenticated. For purchases within an app, consumers will simply touch to pay

and authenticate with their fingerprint or passcode for a seamless experience

without having to enter their card number or leave the app.

"Apple has a long tradition of introducing breakthrough products with features

that really matter to people. Apple Pay, combined with MasterCard's payments

technology, gives consumers an easy, secure and private way to shop," said Ed

McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer, MasterCard.

Apple Pay will be made available for US consumers via a free update to iOS 8 in

October. MasterCard cardholders will be able to make simple and secure payments

in the apps of top merchants.
