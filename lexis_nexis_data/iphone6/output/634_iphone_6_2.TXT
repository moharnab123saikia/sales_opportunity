Apple unveiled its latest products during a huge launch event in California last

night.



The tech giants revealed a new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, along with a giant iPad

Pro tablet and the new Apple TV.



It's available in America from September 25, with pre-orders from September 12.



The two new handsets will keep the same 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch sizes of the

current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones, but there is a new colour that has

been added to the range called Rose Gold.

Both of the new phones will include the 3D Touch that the Apple Watch already

has. This lets you press the screen harder, with the new handsets picking up the

difference in pressure, which can be ideal for when users are playing games and

want to increase the pressure for a jump or shot for example.



Both the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus have better cameras as opposed to the

current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus'. The new mobile phones will take better

pictures, but can also shoot video in 4K quality making them four times as

detailed as regular HD video. Selfies will also be better than ever as Apple

have improved the FaceTime camera to 5MP.



A feature called Live Photos has been added to the iPhone 6S cameras which is on

by default and lets you record a 1.5 second long video, before and after your

shot. This means if you're taking a picture, the phone will capture the moments

around the shot.



Another great addition is the Retina flash mechanism, where the display of the

Apple iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. This means the new phones light up three times more

than its regular brightness and it considers ambient lighting so that when it's

dark you can still take selfies.

The new iPhones have an updated processor that Apple called the A9, which is 70%

faster than the current iPhone 6's A8 chip on CPU tracks and 90% on graphics.

And according to Apple, the extra power and more efficient operating system

leads to an even better battery.



The iPhone 6S will go on sale for $199 for the 16GB on a 24 month contract,

which is roughly £129.



That goes up to $299 for the 64GB which is approximately £194, and $399 (£259)

for 128GB model.



The larger sized iPhone 6S Plus will start at $299 (£194) for the 16GB version

on a 24 month contract.



This goes up to $399 which is roughly £259 for the 64GB model, and $499 (£324)

for the 128GB handset.



The two new handsets have not been given a UK date that they will go on sale,

but are said to be coming soon.



Apple has created a new mega tablet which is a huge 12.9in across, which is much

bigger than the current iPad Air 2 which is 9.7in.



The iPad Pro comes in three different versions: 32GB, 128GB and 128GB with

LTE/4G that requires a SIM card. These will all go on sale in November and in

time for Christmas.



The 32GB model will cost $799 which roughly converts to £520. The 128GB version

will cost $999, which is about £650 and the LTE 126GB model is $1099, which is

roughly £715.



Apple hasn't confirmed the UK prices yet, so they could be even higher.



When unveiling the new iPad Pro, Apple's CEO Tim Cook introduced the model

itself, but invited two Microsoft members of staff to demonstrate how well

Microsoft Office works on the device.



It also now has its own stylus which Apple calls the "Pencil".



Available in late October.



Apple has revealed a completely new version of its Apple TV set-top box, adding

the Siri feature into the remotes, and a new TV app store, which any developer

can build an app for.



Apple CEO Tim Cook says "The future of TV is apps".



This would mean that any TV channel could, in theory, use an app to broadcast

their content through Apple TV, and could avoid the expensive subscription

packages that include channels that you may never watch. For example, paying for

an on-demand app for one channel means that you can pick and choose what you pay

for.



Will you be first in the queue for Apple's latest gadgets?



The apps also include games so you can get them on your big screen in your

living room.



The new TV operating system will be called tvOS and will be based on iOS that

the mobile phones have, but will be designed for the living room.



The new remote will have an accelerometer and a gyroscope, and the battery will

last 3 months on a single charge.



The new Apple TV will cost $149 (£96) for the 32GB model, and $199 (£129) for

the 64GB model.



The current generation Apple TV will still be available, for £69 - but there's

no news on whether an upgrade will be available to the new tvOS.
