5.5. inch iPhone 6 has leaked online.

Sonny Dickson has shared the leaked images of iPhone 6 5.5 inch with 9to5Mac.
The two pics shared are of the LCD display screen of the upcoming iPhone.
Diagonally the screen measures 14 cms (that is 5.5 inches).

Earlier this year the Chinese social networking site Weibo posted a pic of dummy
of the iPhone 6. The picture showed a profile different from the iPhone 5S, but
was similar to the iPone 5C.

Nowhereelse also posted few pictures of the upcoming iPhone 6's case showing a
thin profile, ring/silent switch button and the volume rocker on the side as
usual and sim card tray on the right side.

This leaked case was similar in looks to the iPhone 6 in the video of a 'dummy'
iPhone 6 handset.

The Apple iPhone 6 is expected to be launched in two display sizes of 4.7 inches
and 5.5 inches in September or October this year.
