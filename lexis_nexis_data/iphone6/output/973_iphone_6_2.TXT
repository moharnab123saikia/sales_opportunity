Many analysts are pointing towards a bigger screen iPhone to come in 2014.



Tuesday, October 29, 2013: The next generation Apple iPhone 6 could reportedly

be announced in the summer of 2014. According to reports, Gene Munster, senior

analyst for Piper Jaffray, a US investment bank, has sent a note to Apple

investors mentioning that the technology giant will be launching the eighth

instalment in its successful iPhone series with a bigger display. The new iPhone

will reportedly be launched in September next year.



Munster is not the only analyst to predict the launch of the iPhone 6 next year

with a bigger display though. Another analyst, Brian White, has also said the

same thing. White's reportedly made the statement after meeting with a supplier.

Gizbot quoted White as saying, "Our meeting with a tech supply chain vendor

highlighted a bigger iPhone is in the works, and our contact expects a launch in

the 2Q:14/3Q:14 time frame. Nearly a year ago, our research in Asia uncovered

early stage work on a larger iPhone and we indicated in our Apple initiation

report dated 9/4/13 that a larger screen size on the iPhone is possible in 2014,

that could approach 5-inches. Given today's meeting, we are confident that a

larger iPhone (approximately five inches) will become a reality in 2014."



Further, Gizbot also reported that Peter Misek, an analyst from Jeffries, also

believes that the Cupertino-based technology giant is in advanced stages of

launching the iPhone with a bigger display. Misek though pointed towards a

12.1-cm (4.8-inch) screen.



Apple's recent iPhone 5S has received a lot of flak for the lack of a big enough

screen. In addition, the company also tried its hand with a low cost iPhone 5C,

which has reportedly not reaped the rewards the company was hoping to. With

screen sizes going as big as 6-inches with the Nokia Lumia 1520, the pressure is

on Apple to come up with something bigger.
