Just three days after launching a crowd-funding campaign, Lunatik has raised

more than $125,000, well above its original goal of $100,000, for two iPhone 6

cases well-suited to the outdoor adventurer: they feature an airtight

compression closure system that protect from water and dust.



They also offer impact protection that the company claims exceeds military

standards, referencing the MIL-STD-810G test used by the United States Military

to classify protective equipment.



When all ports are closed, the iPhone 6 will be submergible for up to an hour in

water that's two meters deep.



TAKTIK 360



This case is said to be indestructible and its screen features an extra

protective layer called the Corning Gorilla Glass, which does not compromise the

touch-screen system of the iPhone 6. It comes with a separate locking key and

audio extender for attaching headphones.



AQUATIK



Ultra form-fitting to the iPhone 6, this is Lunatik's slimmest iPhone protective

case yet, according to the company. That being said, they even found room to

attach a non-slip impact bumper and its photo lens allows for crisp, clear

pictures.



The company is also creating a version of each case for the iPhone 6 plus,

although they will not be part of the campaign in question. To be notified upon

release: www.lunatik.com/products/iphone-6-plus/taktik-360?variant=black



The TAKTIK 360 for iPhone 6 can be pre-ordered for $99, and the AQUATIK for

iPhone 6 for $79 with delivery expected in March 2015. Orders outside the US

cost $20 extra for shipping and handling.
