New iPhones bend out of shape in back pockets

Owners of the new iPhone 6 Plus have complained that the oversized smartphone

can bend out of shape if it is carried around in trouser pockets.



Some took to online forums, blogs and social media yesterday to post photographs

of warped handsets, which are the largest and thinnest smartphones that Apple

has ever made.



The iPhone 6 Plus, which costs between £619 and £789 without a contract, is the

bigger brother of the iPhone 6. Both models went on sale on Friday.



The apparent bending problem is not unique to the iPhone 6 Plus, however. Owners

of certain Samsung Galaxy, BlackBerry and Sony Xperia handsets have previously

reported problems, as have owners of iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 models. Apple did not

respond to requests for comment yesterday.



The hashtag "Bendgate" was trending on Twitter as disgruntled owners posted

pictures of warped phones.



Hanzoh, a member of the MacRumours forum, said that his iPhone 6 Plus bent out

of shape after he drove to a wedding and back with the handset in his trouser

pocket.



The issue prompted Lewis Hilsenteger, of Unbox Therapy, a YouTube consumer

products channel, to post a video of him bending an iPhone 6 Plus by hand. The

video had more than six million views last night.



"Not necessarily the piece of information that you guys want to receive as

brand-new owners of this device," Mr Hilsenteger said. "This is a huge piece of

aluminium and we all know that aluminium is incredibly malleable - but now we

have actual evidence on camera, not just a picture of a bent phone."



He later tested a comparably sized Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and was unable to do

any lasting damage.
