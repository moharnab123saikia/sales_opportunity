New Delhi, Sept. 9 -- Zee Media Bureau

 US tech giant Apple Inc on Wednesday launched the much anticipated iPhone 7 and

iPhone 7 Plus during an exciting event at the Bill Graham auditorium in San

Francisco.





 With the new iPhones, Apple finally paid heed to the complaints of its

customers and did away with 16GB internal memory variant - which means that the

iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus variants come with a minimum 32GB internal memory.

 However, the launch of the new iPhones has affected three other iPhones of

Apple - the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

 These three iPhones have been removed from the company's website in India

suggesting that they have been 'discontinued'.

 This comes as bad news for customers who look towards buying older iPhones as

prices fall after the launch of new phones.

 Usually, Apple cuts the prices of its iPhones once new ones are launched in the

market.

 But having said that, the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus could still be

available in the market with third-party.

 And finally, this leaves Indian customers with just three series of iPhones to

choose from - iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, iPhone 6S and 6S Plu and iPhone SE.
