not receive their handset until next month because of high demand, Apple has
said.

More than four million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets were ordered in the
24 hours after advance sales began last Friday.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were revealed at a celebrity launch event near
Apple's headquarters in California last week, along with the company's first
wearable device, Apple Watch.

Apple said that it had held back some iPhone 6 stock for its retail stores, to
go on sale at 8am on Friday.

Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said: "We are thrilled customers love them as
much as we do."

The iPhone 6 costs £539 without a contract, and the Plus version is £619 without
a contract. Orders will begin to be sent out from Friday.

Apple plans to start selling Watch for $349 (£215) next year. The company is
said to be preparing to launch the next generation of its iPad next month.
