Customers who ordered the iPhone 6 in advance have been warned that they might

not receive their handset until next month because of high demand, Apple has

said.



More than four million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets were ordered in the

24 hours after advance sales began last Friday.



The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were revealed at a celebrity launch event near

Apple's headquarters in California last week, along with the company's first

wearable device, Apple Watch.



Apple said that it had held back some iPhone 6 stock for its retail stores, to

go on sale at 8am on Friday.



Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said: "We are thrilled customers love them as

much as we do."



The iPhone 6 costs £539 without a contract, and the Plus version is £619 without

a contract. Orders will begin to be sent out from Friday.



Apple plans to start selling Watch for $349 (£215) next year. The company is

said to be preparing to launch the next generation of its iPad next month.
