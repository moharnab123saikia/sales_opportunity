This time a quick start guide has surfaced for Apple iPhone 6 with its launch

date and details of prominent features too.



Thursday, August 28, 2014: Several reports have been doing the rounds that Apple

iPhone 6 will be launched on 9 September. But a new leaked image has somewhat

confirmed these reports. The quick start guide has actually reconfirmed the

launch date and also the design of the phone.



The next iPhone 6 models are tipped to launch in mid-September and we are aware

of that since quite some time now. If this 9 September date is final, then it is

the \same date when Apple unveiled iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s last year. The leaked

image has been published by Nowhereelse.fr. They also leaked iPhone 5s' quick

start guide last year ahead of the official announcement.



The alleged quick start guide further validates that the next iPhone will have

the power button on the right panel of the device, instead of the top panel,

which is usual on current iPhone models. But some contradictions with previous

leaks have emerged too. A new design of the iPhone 6 has come out now. The new

leak has shown that the iPhone 6 sports the same straight-edge industrial

design, instead of curved edges.



The leaked quick start guide also shows some features like the lighting

connector at the bottom and Touch ID sensor on the home button. The 128GB model

has been reconfirmed too. Last week leaked schematics hinted that the new iPhone

will have a 128GB inbuilt storage variant. There will be other variants too like

16GB and 64GB.
