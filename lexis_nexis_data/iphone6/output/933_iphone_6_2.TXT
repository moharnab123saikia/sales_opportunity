Samsung strikes back with designer phone

SAMSUNG is striking back against the iPhone 6 with a blitz of new smartphones to

arrive on the Irish market in the coming weeks.



The electronics giant launched a designer (EURO)600 handset in Dublin last night

to compete with Apple's newly announced handsets.



Samsung's 4.7-inch Galaxy Alpha model ditches the manufacturer's traditional

plastic casing in favour of metal edging, which it hopes will attract

fashion-conscious customers rather than just tech-savvy ones.



The phone is slightly smaller than the firm's existing Galaxy S5 phone and has a

marginally less powerful camera.



Samsung has been nervously looking on as long queues for Apple's newest phones

formed over the last week outside shops in the US, Britain and Germany, where

the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus go on sale today. Irish outlets will not stock

the new iPhone until next Friday.



The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are set to significantly dent Samsung's market

share due to the Apple devices' larger screen sizes.



Previous Apple iPhones were restricted to 3.5-inch and 4-inch handsets, allowing

Samsung to capture a large part of the most valuable end of the market for big

screen devices. The new iPhones have displays up to twice the size of the iPhone

5 and are expected to undercut the appeal of Samsung's top models.
