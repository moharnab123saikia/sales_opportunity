Chatter about the anticipated iPhone 6 continues to flood the internet every

day.



Today, while all the rumours continue to point to two versions of Apple'sÂ next

generation smartphone - a 4.7" model and a 5.5" version - speculation is also

rife about the resolution of the screen.



As the tech giant's biggest launch of the year draws near, talk is that the 4.7"

iPhone 6 will likely feature a resolution of 1334 x 750 with 326 pixels per

inch, while the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 would most likely have a resolution of 2208 x

1242 with 461 pixels per per inch.



The iPhone 6 is now widely expected to be unveiled in the first week of

September at a media event.



Apple moles suggest the 4.7" version will go on sale about a week after the

announcement but rumours are rife that the 5.5" model may be held back due to

production issues.



As well as a larger display, the iPhone 6 is predicted to feature a thinner

design, a faster A8 processor, an improved camera and a more durable Touch ID

sensor.



Will you be buying the iPhone 6 on launch day?
