

Chatter about the anticipated iPhone 6 continues to flood the internet every
day.

Today, while all the rumours continue to point to two versions of Apple's next
generation smartphone - a 4.7" model and a 5.5" version - speculation is also
rife about the resolution of the screen.

As the tech giant's biggest launch of the year draws near, talk is that the 4.7"
iPhone 6 will likely feature a resolution of 1334 x 750 with 326 pixels per
inch, while the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 would most likely have a resolution of 2208 x
1242 with 461 pixels per per inch.

The iPhone 6 is now widely expected to be unveiled in the first week of
September at a media event.

Apple moles suggest the 4.7" version will go on sale about a week after the
announcement but rumours are rife that the 5.5" model may be held back due to
production issues.

As well as a larger display, the iPhone 6 is predicted to feature a thinner
design, a faster A8 processor, an improved camera and a more durable Touch ID
sensor.

Will you be buying the iPhone 6 on launch day?
