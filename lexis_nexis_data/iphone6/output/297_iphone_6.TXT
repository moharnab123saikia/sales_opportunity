iPphone 6- the Iphone 6 with a 4.7 inch display screen and the Iphone 6 Plus
with a 5.5 inch display screen. Both were bigger from the earlier generation
iPhone 5S and 5C with 4 inch display screens.

While the bigger iPhone is an entry into the phablet segment, the iPhone seems
as a successor of the iPhone 5S with a bigger screen and better feature.

Today we bring you what the big tech portals are saying about the new iPhone 6.
But before we go into the details of how the International media has reviewed
it, let us look at its pros and cons first.
