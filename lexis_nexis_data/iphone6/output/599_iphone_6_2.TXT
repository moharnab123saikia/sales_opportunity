

NEW YORK (AP) -- Apple had more than 4 million advance orders of its new, larger
iPhones in the first 24 hours, exceeding its initial supply, the company said
Monday.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be delivered to customers starting Friday
and throughout Sep tember, but many won't be delivered until October, Apple
said.

Phones will still be available Friday on a walk-in basis at Apple retail stores
and from various wireless carriers and authorized Apple resellers.

Apple's website had intermittent outages last Friday because of heavy traffic as
orders began online. The company said the 4 million orders set a new 24-hour
record, beating the 2 million orders in 2012. That was for the iPhone 5, the
previous time Apple increased the iPhone's screen size.

Last year, Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c phones in the first
three days they were on sale, but the company didn't say how many came in the
first 24 hours of advance orders.

The iPhone 5, 5s and 5c have screens measuring 4 inches diagonally. The iPhone 6
is 4.7 inches, and the iPhone 6 Plus is 5.5 inches.

Besides larger screens, the new phones announced last week offer faster
performance and a wireless chip for making credit card payments at retail stores
by holding the phone near the payment terminal. The phones start at $199 with a
two-year service contact.

A free update to Apple's iOS software for mobile devices will be available to
existing users on Wednesday.

The new phones will come with the update, known as iOS 8.
