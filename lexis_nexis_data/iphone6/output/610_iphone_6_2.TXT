iPhone 6 rumor rollup for week ending Dec. 7;

Leaks, screws, parsing press releases, NFC, unwired charging



BYLINE: John Cox



LENGTH: 1818 words





iOSphere rumors make it Christmas every day: They are the gift that keeps on

giving, no matter what time of year. This week, more "leaked photos" showing the

outside case of the iPhone 6, or perhaps the 5S, and revealing within (trumpet

fanfare, please!) fewer screws.



Also: how the iOSphere parses a press release and uncovers the hidden fact that

T-Mobile USA will offer iPhone 6 in 2013; NFC longings; and the magic of

no-contact-needed wireless charging.



You read it here second.



__________ __________ Two "leaked" photos, "which were found on the Web" and

purportedly show the housing of the Next iPhone, were posted by ETrade Supply, a

Hong Kong-based repair parts supplier.



There's already widespread acceptance that the seventh-generation Next iPhone

will not be "iPhone 6" but "iPhone 5S." Because of Apple's "traditional" naming

convention: 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S. That would be the four-year tradition.



"Found on the Web" is without doubt the "Best Worst Source for an iOSphere Rumor

in December." Ours not to reason why. Ours but to post and rumorize. The

pictures were apparently first posted in a site called iPhone5parts.net,

described as an online forum for Apple fans.



The photos reveal a phone that looks eerily like -- or as ETrade says "very

similar to" - the iPhone 5.



"From the background, it seems that the pictures were taken at the assembly line

of an operation stage," ETrade says, with the confidence common to iOSphere

rumors. The confidence seems misplaced: The background is a featureless green

surface. You can't even tell if it's a wall or a floor or a desk. And what the

heck does "operation stage" actually mean?



However. "However, the reason why we say it is a suspected iPhone 5s rear

housing is that the specific information below the logo, which are replaced by

'X'. Usually, the parts with 'X' stand for test prototype."



X marks the prototype. What could be simpler?



ETrade nevertheless is able to winkle out changes. "First, the 'iPhone 5s' has

two less screw holes on the left side which are used to fasten the LCD."

Doubtless another example of Apple's genius in reducing the bill of materials

cost for its product.



"Second, the position of 3 screw holes used to fasten the logic board has been

removed (not sure whether caused by the change of logic board)." It's not clear

if ETrade thinks the screws are evidence of "a" change in the logic board or

that the entire logic board has been changed.



Once it had given the customary "take all this with Andre-the-Giant-sized

pinches of salt," Macworld UK's David Price threw salt to the wind and got down

to brass tacks.  These changes "may suggest cosmetic or superficial changes from

iPhone 5 to iPhone 6 (sorry, 'iPhone 5S'), or they may suggest fundamental

modifications to the internal componentry and screen."



One or the other. For sure.



International Business Times' Louis Bedigan reports this rumor based on the

announcement by Deutsche Telekom that its subsidiary, T-Mobile USA, and Apple

signed a deal "to bring products to market together in 2013."



The announcement didn't mention "iPhone 6." In fact, it didn't mention any

specific product; just, you know, "products." But if you know how to interpret

what's not being said by reading between the lines, you can see what others

can't.



"No other details were announced, but tech bloggers are already speculating on

what this could mean for Apple and its product lineup in 2013," Bedigan wrote,

gracefully passing over his own modest contribution to tech speculation. "CNET

warns that the deal may not relate to the iPhone at all and could simply involve

the iPad."



Be warned, T-Mobile subscribers: You simply might get only the iPad.



"Right now the rumor mill insists that Apple will prematurely upgrade the iPhone

5 ... with a new model this winter [2013]," Bedigan writes.



"Prematurely upgrade" sounds rather like "prematurely gray" -- something you

don't want to happen until later; much later, in fact. Bedigan probably means

that the Next iPhone will be "occurring, growing, or existing before the

customary, correct, or assigned time."



Because history, all five years of it with six models, clearly shows what is

customary for the iPhone: They're announced in June or July. Except for the

first iPhone, which was announced in January. And the last two, which were

announced in September or October. So whenever they announce the next one, it's

guaranteed to be premature.



"If Apple wanted to bring the iPhone to T-Mobile in the near future, an upgrade

would be necessary," Bedigan declares. "While it could simply convert the

existing model (as it did with the iPhone 4 when it came to Verizon), Apple will

get more attention -- and likely sell more units -- if it provides T-Mobile with

an enhanced model."



So even though Apple just "simply converted" iPhone 4 to run on Verizon's

network, and sold millions and millions of them, it's somehow necessary for

Apple to "upgrade" or "enhance" the iPhone to sell it on T-Mobile's network.



One suspects that most T-Mobile customers who are interested in the iPhone would

be happy to have even an "un-enhanced" iPhone 5, especially if it supports

HSPA+42.



"Of course, Apple cannot simply enhance the iPhone for one carrier; it must

provide the new version to every carrier," Bedigan writes. "This might be the

real source of the iPhone 5S rumors."



The real source of the iPhone 5S rumors is everyone with access to a website, a

keyboard, and a Deutsche Telekom press release that fails to mention the word "

iPhone."



You can't trust Apple. Let's get that out there right up front.



"Apple is known to backtrack on its plans, or even to distort reality simply to

shift attention away from its actual plans," writes Filip Truta at

Softpedia.com. "The iPad mini is a good example of that."



And how. Remember the late Steve Jobs saying 9.7 inches was the perfect size for

a tablet screen? And now they have one with a 7.9-inch screen?



Ditto for near-field communication, a short-range wireless technology touted

endlessly for years as enabling the Magic of Contactless Purchases and the

Digital Wallet: Just wave your NFC smartphone and buy, buy, buy!



So when Apple marketing supremo Phil Schiller tells the world in September 2012

that "It's not clear that NFC is the solution to any current problem. Passbook

does the kinds of things customers need today," you know he's either

backtracking or distorting reality or even telling the truth. One of them, for

sure.



But Truta says wireless chipmaker Qualcomm will change all that. That's because

Qualcomm "just announced a new Near Field Communication (NFC) chip that makes

perfect sense for the next-generation iPhone 6, or even the rumored iPhone 5S."



And if Schiller and his boss Tim Cook don't know that, they can just ask Truta.

Or read the Qualcomm press release.



"Qualcomm confirmed that its QCA1990 SoC (system on a chip) is the industry's

smallest, ultra-low power NFC package 'with an overall footprint that is 50

percent smaller than current NFC chips available in the market,' said the press

release," notes Truta, making it sound as if he had personally hounded a hapless

Qualcomm exec, ambushed him, backed him into a corner, hammered him with

questions until, broken and sobbing, this wretch confessed that "Yes, YES!!! It

has an overall footprint that is 50%smaller than current NFC chips!" instead of

just quoting from the company's press release.



"Apple is widely believed to release an incremental iPhone 5S this summer,

staying in line with tradition (iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4S)," Bedigan writes.

Tradition: It's how we keep our balance.  The incremental, premature, virtually

identical iPhone 5S. With NFC. And a few missing screws.



A recently published patent application shows Apple is looking at wireless

charging for its mobile devices. And you know what that means: iPhone 6 will

have wireless charging.



But it's not just any wireless charging, like Nokia uses for some of its Lumia

smartphones. In the Nokia system, you have to physically put your phone on top

of the charging pad, so they're actually touching.



With Apple's system, they won't have to touch. Your iPhone 6 can charge even if

it's three (3!) feet away.



"That's right - no contact required," writes TechRadar's Clint Demeritt, who

noticed the published application and linked to it.  The awesomeness lies in

using "near field magnetic resonance (NFMR)." Demeritt doesn't spend much time

explaining what this actually is. Basically, NFMR creates a low-density magnetic

field between two coils, one a power source and the other a power capture

device. They oscillate ("resonate") at the same frequency, transferring the

energy. One example of resonance is the energy transferred by a singer's voice

to a glass: the glass picks up the energy, oscillates at the same frequency and

eventually shatters.



A key development in this area is the work by MIT's Dr. Marin Soljacic, who was

able to separate the two coils over much longer distances than anyone had

thought possible. Soljacic's breakthrough, dubbed "highly resonant magnetic

coupling," is being commercialized by Massachusetts-based WiTricity. More

details of this approach, and examples of how it can be widely applied, are in

our January 2010 interview with company CEO Eric Giler. The company is releasing

a technology demonstration kit designed for engineers.  "Being able to charge

devices from a meter away is a notable advancement and may help proliferate the

technology," Demeritt writes. "At the very least it means devices won't have to

crowd around and touch a physical object to charge."



That crowding thing. What a drag. Very notable to be able to set your iPhone 6

down three feet from the charger. Think how our Digital Life will change.



And the patent application also is a morale booster. "The patent should give

hope to those who were disappointed by the iPhone 5," Demeritt writes. "Wireless

charging was on the wish list of many Apple fans during the media hype lead-up

of the latest iPhone." The Disappointed: their name is legion.



Demeritt says "the patent is meant to tackle the 'unwieldy' configuration of the

many wired chargers and power sources needed for multiple wireless devices. If

Apple can cut through that clutter it would make charging iPhones, iPads and

iPods together a lot simpler."



Not just simpler, a lot simpler. A lot simpler than this, which is taken from

Apple's support document on charging the iPhone:  "To charge the battery, choose

one of the options below: "For the quickest charge, connect the device to a

power outlet using the USB cable that came with the device and an Apple USB

power adapter.



"Connect the device directly to a USB port on your computer (not an external

keyboard) using the USB cable that came with the device ...



"Connect the device to an externally-powered USB hub."
