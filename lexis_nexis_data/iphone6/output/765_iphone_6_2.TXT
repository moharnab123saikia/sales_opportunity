

Could Apple be planning to launch its new iPhone 6 on September 19th?

The date was reportedly leaked by staff at German phone firm Deutsche Telekom.

Support reps at the company are said to have been told the date of the hotly
anticipated release, according to the website apfelpage.de.

Although it is highly unlikely Apple revealed a specific launch date to phone
firms so far in advance, it fits with the US company's tendency to release its
new phones on a Friday.

September 19th falls on a Friday this year.

Last year, for example, the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c were both released on
Friday, September 20th - while the year before the iPhone 5 was released on
Friday, September 21st.

Germany is usually one of Apple's initial launch markets for iPhones, along with
several other nations, including the UK.

The French website, nowhereelse.fr released the video below showing what it
claims is a 'dummy' iPhone 6 handset.

It is believed a total of 80 million iPhone 6 handsets would be produced this
year.

Industry watchers have said increasing the iPhone's screen size from 4 inches
would help Apple regain market share from competitors such as Samsung, who they
say have responded to consumer desire for more screen size.
