IPhone 6 fingerprint sensor rumored to be included in the next iPhone, as early

as June. Besides the iPhone 6 fingerprint technology, there are also reports of

a bigger screen iPhone.

The latest iPhone rumor is that the iPhone 5s, sometimes dubbed the iPhone 6,

will include a fingerprint detector.



The source? KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a good track record for

predicting when new Apple products will launch, says that Apple's next iPhone 6

(a.k.a 5s) will include a fingerprint sensor for security. He's saying this next

version of the Apple smartphone could launch in June or July, which would be

ahead of the typical fall release schedule. Kuo also thinks that the iPhone 5S

will have an improved camera and will have a more powerful A7 chip, according to

ComputerWorld in Singapore.



The arrival of an iPhone fingerprint sensor shouldn't come as too big of a

surprise. Earlier this year, Apple purchased AuthenTec, a mobile network

security for about $356 million. One of AuthenTec's key products: fingerprint

sensors.



But neither Apple nor AuthenTec are alone in this field. As LAPTOP reported last

week, Validity Sensors, a company that supplies fingerprint readers to the PC

market, is moving into mobile too.



At CES last week, Validity Director of Technical Marketing Dough Vargha showed

off a Samsung Android phone [with fingerprint sensor] ... "Not only does that

provide a simple user experience, [but] it also is high security," he told us.

"It's easy to hack a four-digit PIN, but a fingerprint belongs to you and you

only." Vargha explained that fingerprint authentication, which Validity calls

"Natural Login," will be used not only to log into a device, but also to

validate ecommerce transactions.



As long as we're talking Apple iPhone rumors, The Christian Science Monitor's

Matt Shaer reported Monday that there are reports of a larger iPhone in the

works. It's a new 4.8-inch smart phone tentatively dubbed the "iPhone Math." The

current iPhone 5 has a 4 inch screen.



'Although former Apple CEO Steve Jobs once said 3.5-inches was the perfect size

for a smartphone display, Apple expanded the display from 3.5 inches to 4 inches

for the iPhone 5 - an attempt to keep up with massive gadgets such as the HTC

Droid DNA and Samsung Galaxy S III."
