Srinagar, July 16 -- Apple may not launch its highly-rumoured 5.5-inch iPhone 6

this year. According to an Apple Insider report citing KGI Securities analyst

Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a proven track record of revealing Apple's future product

plans, the release of the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 model could be postponed to 2015 due

to production issues. The company, however, is expected to unveil only a

4.7-screen version of the iPhone 6 this fall, probably in September.



"Apple is already facing production bottlenecks on the 4.7-inch model related to

the new technology for the device's in-cell touch panel, as well as colour

unevenness on the redesigned "iPhone 6" metal casing. Those problems are said to

be even worse with the larger 5.5-inch model," said the report quoting Kuo.



Both iPhone 6 screens are expected to use in-cell touch panel technology - built

into the screen and allowing for thinner construction than with standard touch

panel films - that was introduced with the iPhone 5, the sources said.



Apple is expected to unveil only a 4.7-screen version of the iPhone 6 this fall,

probably in September.



Industry watchers have said increasing the iPhone's screen size from 4 inches

would help Apple regain market share from competitors such as Samsung

Electronics Co Ltd, who they say have responded to consumer desire for more

screen size.
