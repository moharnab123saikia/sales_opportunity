HIGHLIGHT: Apple's newly released iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are put through

their paces



The Verdict



Reasons to go with iPhone 6 Plus:



Full HD screen - one with 1920 x 1080 pixels.



Turn the phone on its side and the home screen turns with you.



Photos and video playback look better.



The eight-megapixel snapper's optical image stabilisation is more sophisticated

and effective.



Bigger battery which just keeps going.



Best for bigger mitts or greedier eyes.



APPLE fans suffering Android envy over bigger screen sizes have finally been put

out of their misery.



But the question many will be asking themselves now is the bigger iPhone 6 Plus

really better?



When Apple released the 5s and 5c last year, the choice was a bit simpler, as

the two phones easily split into "~premium' and "~budget' tiers.



With the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus it's a tougher call, as the stylings and specs are

almost identical.



Ultimately, however, the decision comes down to what you use your phone for.



The iPhone 6 offers a 4.7-inch screen and weighs 129grams, while the 6 Plus has

a 5.5-inch screen and weighs 172grams.



Both are significantly larger and heavier than the iPhone 5s (a 4-inch screen

and 112grams), although the 5s is thicker by at least 0.5mm.



We've tried out both the new iPhones and although it's fair to say that while

the 6 Plus feels pretty comfortable in the hand - those new rounded corners help

a lot - the size of the larger device will surprise people who are used to the

older models.



Before you dismiss the 6 Plus though, it's worth remembering that the larger

screen size offers a number of other advantages, including bigger battery life,

better optical image stabilisation and a new landscape mode for the home screen

and certain apps (email and messages for example) when held horizontally.



Price is also a consideration of course.



Pricing for the 16GB model iPhone 6 starts at $869. There is a $999 cost for the

64GB model, while the new 128GB model is $1129.



iPhone 6 Plus starts at $999 for the 16GB model, $1129 for the 64GB model and

$1249 for the new 128GB model.



Both models come with the new, faster A8 processor and M8 processor, and arrive

kitted out with Apple's new iOS 8 operating system.



So perhaps the better question is not which size are you more comfortable with,

but what do you use your iPhone for?



If you mainly use it for, you know, making calls, sending texts and a bit of

light entertainment on your commute then you're probably better off sticking

with the 4.7-inch iPhone 6.



If you tend to do a lot of work on your iPhone (sorting through a mass of

emails, for example) or are a keen photographer then it's definitely worth

thinking about the 6 Plus, especially if you don't already have an iPad or iPad

mini.



The new iPhone takes its design cues from the iPad, with larger volume buttons

and rounded corners. The iPhone 6 meanwhile is a tad smaller than most other

Android flagship models, including the Galaxy S5 (5.1-inch), the HTC One M8

(5-inch) and Moto X (5.2-inch).



The best advice is to go into a store and see for yourself which is more

comfortable - try navigating around the screen and slipping the device into your

pocket. Just remember to pay for it before you walk out.
