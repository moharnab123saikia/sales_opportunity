KUALA LUMPUR: Celcom Axiata Bhd will be offering iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to

its customers beginning November 6.



Celcom will be one of the first telecommunications providers in Malaysia to

announce the devices' arrival, it said yesterday.



iPhone 6 features an A8 chip built on second-generation 64-bit desktop-class

architecture, which provides better performance and battery life.



It will come in three colours - space grey, gold and silver - at 16GB, 64GB and

128GB in capacity variants. It also boasts a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch Retina HD

display.



Aside from Celcom, Maxis Bhd and DiGi.Com will also be bringing in the

smartphones, packaged with Internet value plans.



iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus debuted on September 19 in the United States, the

United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto

Rico and Singapore.



During their first-weekend launch, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales hit a

combined 10 million units, Apple Inc chief executive officer Tim Cook had said.
