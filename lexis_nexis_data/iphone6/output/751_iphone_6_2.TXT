Apple has long gobbled up an outsized share of the smartphone industrycs

profits. But in the fourth quarter, the iPhone makercs slice of the profit pie

reached comically largely proportions.



In the holiday period, Apple made about $19.4 billion in pre-tax profits from

selling its lineup of iPhones, estimated Michael Walkley, a financial analyst

who covers Apple for Canaccord Genuity, in a report issued Sunday. That

represented about 93 percent of the total operating profits generated by the

entire industry, which was an all-time high for Apple, Walkley wrote.



cWe believe Applecs iPhone 6/6 Plus smartphones dominated December smartphone

sales at unprecedented levels,c Walkley wrote in his report.



In the fourth quarter a year earlier, Apple soaked up 75 percent of smartphone

industry profits, according to Walkley. For all of 2014, profits from iPhone

sales accounted for 79 percent of profits.



Apple reported record earnings last month on huge iPhone sales growth . The

company sold 74.5 million iPhones in the quarter, which was up 46 percent from

the same period a year earlier.



According to Walkleycs report, Apple was one of only two companies whose slice

of the smartphone profit pie was larger than 1 percent. Samsung, which gleaned

about $1.8 billion in profits from selling its lineup of Galaxy phones,

accounted for 9 percent of total industry profits. That was Samsungcs smallest

portion of industry profits since 2008, Walkley wrote.



The six other companies mentioned in Walkleycs report either posted profits that

were so small that they essentiallychad a 0 percent share of the pie, or they

lost money on their smartphone sales, meaning that their share was actually

negative. Microsoft was the worst in that regard; according to Walkleycs

analysis, the software giant lost about $414 million on its smartphone sales in

the fourth quarter, giving it a -2 percent share of industry profits.



cOther leading (smartphone manufacturers)ccontinue to struggle,c he wrote.



Applecs expanding portion of the smartphone industrycs profits has come despite

the fact that its share of total smartphones sold actually was flat last year,

according to Walkleycs estimate. Apple sold 192.7 million iPhones in 2014, which

accounted for 15.5 percent of the total smartphones sold. Thatcs the same share

Apple had in 2013, when it sold 153.5 million, according to Walkley.



Other estimates have indicated that Applecs share of smartphone device sales

actually fell last year.



Walkley forecast that Applecs strong iPhone sales will continue this year, as

existing iPhone owners upgrade their phones to the new models and the new

big-screened iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models lure away Android users.



cWe believe these trends should grow Applecs iPhone installed base and bodes

well for future strong iPhone replacement sales, earnings, and cash flow

generation,c he wrote.
