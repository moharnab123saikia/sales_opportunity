iPhone 6 rumor rollup for the week ending March 21;

iPhone6 already a loser?, assemblers assemble, blame the 5c



BYLINE: John Cox



LENGTH: 2281 words





There was a strong theme of self-congratulation in this week's iOSphere rumors

about the iPhone 6: we already "know"so much about this phone, and of course

about Apple's plans. Or at least about what Apple should be doing.



Or anyway, damn- it, about what's really important in smartphones.



We know so much, in fact, that one blogger boldly proclaimed the iPhone 6 is

already a loser. Another urgently urged Apple to rush the iPhone 6 into release

to staunch the hemorrhaging of customers who are choosing bigger-screen phones

from rivals.



+Also on Network World: Without an iWatch, Apple's Healthbook app is boring | 10

low-code tools for building mobile apps fast + Others optimistically noted that

Chinese assembly plants are getting ready to get ready to be about to start

assembling the Next iPhone, or something; and that it will have an

"Ultra-Retina" display. Still others found yet another reason to hate the iPhone

5c: it's delaying the iPhone 6 release.



You read it here second.



This is the kind of article that makes the iOSphere great: you review a product

that hasn't been announced yet, about which nothing is known with any certainty,

and conclude that it's a lousy product.



And the fact that it probably generates huge page views has nothing to do with

it.



The blogpost, "6 Reasons the iPhone 6 Has Already Lost," is by Avram Piltch,

LaptopMag's Online Editorial Director, and winner of this week's award for Most

Audacious Use of the iPhone 6 in Clickbait Journalism.



Piltch starts by saying Apple fans have been gobbling up rumors of how awesome

and magical the iPhone 6 will be. "However, even the hottest rumor mill in tech

can't turn this device into a winner," Piltch declares. "Based on everything we

know now, the next iPhone will be a year late and a bitcoin short of the

competition, doing nothing to slow Apple's descent from smartphone pioneer to

high tech has-been."



If that doesn't get your heart-racing, you're probably still using the Nokia

6680 of 10 years ago.



Keep in mind, Piltch is explaining why a phone that hasn't been announced, which

is only described in rumors, is a certifiable failure, a loser.



He gives six reasons: weak camera, poor battery life/no removable battery, no

NFC, few sharing options, weak keyboard, and limited customization.



We're not going to go through all of these in depth, in part because many others

quickly did, which is the other reason why the iOSphere is great: we get to read

blogposts like "The worst article about the iPhone 6 has already been written,"



 by TUAW's Mike Wehner.



After running through the deficiencies of Piltch's analysis, Wehner concludes,

"So no, none of these reasons seem to be even remotely within the realm of a

'deal breaker' for the as-of-yet unannounced iPhone 6."



Let's take just one illustrative example: battery life. Piltch's critique of the

non-existent iPhone 6's non-existent battery life is based on LaptopMag's own

battery test of the iPhone 5s. Wehner's comment on this claim applies to all of

Piltch's claims: "I'd like to just remind everyone that of all the things we

don't know about the iPhone 6, the battery is a complete and total mystery.

Stating you'll be disappointed by the iPhone 6 battery is like saying that

riding in a flying saucer is boring. Let me know when you've done it and we'll

re-examine the argument."



The life of a mobile battery depends on a whole range of variables, not just the

size or capacity of the battery itself. Partly for this reason, tech sites such

as AnandTech.com have developed multiple tests that measure battery impact of

different phone functions, trying to create a more holistic view of power use.

AnandTech's review of the iPhone 5s found that its battery life  improved over

the iPhone 5 in some areas, and lagged in others. That was true also for the

recent iPhone models in comparison to rival smartphones - sometimes iPhone

ranked high, sometimes lower, sometimes in the middle of the pack.



Apple addresses power demand comprehensively, for example tuning its processor

and other components to work as quickly as possible and then drop as quickly as

possible to a much lower power state. One can argue that rival smartphones have

bigger batteries than the 5s because they're so inefficient in their power use

that they need bigger batteries.



As Wehner notes, none of these allegedly striking defects have stopped tens of

millions of consumers from buying the iPhone, including a record number, over 50

million, in the Oct-Dec 2013 quarter.



Apple can't wait until September to release the iPhone 6. It must do it soon,

like ASAP soon. Otherwise, you know, Apple is doomed.



This refrain surfaced this week in places like Valuewalk, where Aman Jain's

blogpost noted that some analysts are still predictably predicting that Apple

will wait until September. "However, a report from Forbes by Chuck Jones

believes that Apple should come out with the iPhone 6 ASAP," he says.



That makes it sound like Jones is an experienced reporter for Forbes, with

legions of fact-checkers, proofreaders and of course even more experienced

editors to work and consult with on a path breaking story.



In fact, Jones is a "contributor" to Forbes: he's one of numerous self-motivated

bloggers that Forbes allows to post their opinions. As he makes clear at the

start of his blogpost, he's also an investor with a position in Apple stock and

the founder of  Sand Hill Insights, "which provides research of new technologies

and their solutions," according to his Twitter profile.



He lists his website as sandhillinsights.com but that URL didn't work when The

Rollup tried it.



Jones argues that Apple should release iPhone 6 as soon as possible because  "of

course Apple is losing sales to competitor's larger screen smartphones."

Apparently droves of iPhone and Android users coming off their two-year mobile

contracts are flocking to those big-screen monster phones from Samsung or the

other dozen or so smartphone vendors that are sharing the tiny percentage of the

market not claimed by Samsung and Apple.



He doesn't bother to cite any data. But more importantly, he's vastly

oversimplifying the market and the buyers who make it up. He implies that the

primary criteria for most buyers is simply the size of the screen. Samsung: big

screen. Apple: small screen. It's a no-brainer, eh? Yet in the Oct-Dec 2013

quarter Apple sold over 50 million iPhones, a new record, nearly all of them

with a 4-inch display.



For years, Apple has been "losing customers" to cheap, high-volume Android

smartphones. Yet Apple clearly has no intention of pursuing that market. So far

that strategy has led Apple to the point where it commands 87 percent of all

mobile industry profits, according to one estimate. That's actually an increase

over the previous year share of 78 percent. The same estimate puts Samsung's

share at just over 32 percent, which adds up to 119 percent, which means that

remaining vendors are losing money in this business.



Jones' second reason for an ASAP iPhone 6 is that "it would be better from a

manufacturing perspective to not have to build for such a huge spike in

demand....This means its contract manufacturers have to staff up and run their

factories with a lot of overtime and then probably have to ramp down their

staffing levels. I spent the first three years of my IBM career in a

manufacturing site and what everyone wants is a smooth production schedule, not

one with peaks and valleys."



We don't always get what want.



But more importantly, think about Jones' description of the problem and his

solution. Apple has been planning to release iPhone 6 in September with all

those inefficient, costly manufacturing hills and valleys (Apple CEO Tim Cook,

we hope you're paying attention!). So Jones wants Apple to change that: to move

that entire complex process up by three months or six months. What does he think

that change will do to the overtime costs, manpower needs, and production

schedule? Rushing to get the iPhone 6 out earlier than planned will create a

production peak that makes Mount Everest look like prairie dog burrow.  There

are a lot of unknowns about the 2014 iPhone models, including whether the

high-end phone will be changed into a bigger-screened device, or whether Apple

will introduce a separate third iPhone model, creating a three-phone portfolio:

the follow-ons to the 5c and 5s (will they have larger screens also?), and a new

even-larger-screen model.



But apart from Jones' dire predictions, there's no real evidence that Apple is,

or should be, in a panic about "losing customers" and is rushing to introduce

its products sooner than planned.



Taiwan-based Pegatron "is gearing up to start mass-producing the next-generation

iPhone," according to Mike Beasley at 9to5Mac.  He, and many others, are basing

this on a translation of a Chinese-language post at "The Commercial Times." You

can find that post here, which won't do you much good unless you read Chinese.

But there is Google Translate, which as always a mixed blessing.



According to The Rollup's copy/paste results with Google, here's the start of

the story: "Apple iPhone 6 is expected to show up in the second half, it is

understood, and Master ( 4938 ) won the part of the iPhone 6 orders for the

expansion of production capacity, and the newly established Master Kunshan "Shi

Shuo" is now finishing factory, recruiting staff, is expected to 3rd season

starts running."



That qualifies as a "riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma," to quote

Winston Churchill but the Main Point is clear, right? Some factory, probably a

really big one, is going to pretty soon starts running and crank out the Next

iPhone.



"Currently not much is known about the so-called iPhone 6 aside from a few

details about its display, which is said to be made of sapphire (possibly at

Apple's new Mesa, Ariz., plant) and will be bigger than the current iPhone

display," Beasley writes, in a sentence that manages to be both understatement

and overstatement at the same time. We know almost nothing about the iPhone 6,

including the rumored sapphire glass cover and the rumored display size.



But whatever it will be, according to The Commercial Times, "For the second half

of iPhone 6 to prepare for the production, Shi Shuo has begun hiring is expected

to recruit thousands of workers will be trained to go to Shanghai Chang-seok,

the second quarter is expected to formally put into production in the third

quarter volume."



Without knowing more about Apple's supply chain in general and Pegatron's

manufacturing for Apple, it's problematic drawing definite conclusions from this

sketchy report. At some point, the assembly lines have to start, possibly with

an initially low output, and then scale upward to meet Apple's inventory targets

for whenever the new phone, or phones, go on sale. Is that a one-quarter

process? Or longer?



One more reason to hate the iPhone 5c.



Apple's announced this week a new version of iPhone 5, with a lower price tag

because it has less memory (8GB). Because of that desperate move to shore up a

manifestly failed product, Apple has to delay releasing the iPhone 6.



This remarkable interpretation was crafted by, among others, Kristin Dian

Mariano, in a blogpost at International Business Times.  The reasoning, if it

can be called that, goes like this: Apple was going to release the awesomely

magical iPhone 6 in June 2014 at the next Apple Worldwide Developers Conference;

but the iPhone 5c has been a "bit of a flop," Mariano says, so the launch of a

cheaper 5c model, with 8GB of storage, "will help Apple regain its stance in the

market."



But in order for this new model of the iFlop to, um, fail just as effectively as

the original, Apple has to delay releasing the iPhone 6.



It's all so obvious.



As we note this week [See "The great 'iPhone 5c is a failure' freakout"], there

is no credible evidence whatever that the iPhone 5c is a failure. That little

evidence we have, including Tim Cook's widely and wildly misunderstood comments

during the January quarterly earnings call, indicate that the 5c is achieving

the goals Apple set for it.   This is just one of three completely unsupported

assertions, contained in separate tweets by Sonny Dickson, a young Australian

who has received photos and, at least in the past, parts taken from Apple's

supply chain partners. At least some have proven to be authentic when the yearly

new iPhone subsequently was released.



Dickson sent four tweets altogether:iPhone 6 will be 0.22 inches thick

#JustSayingUltra-Retina screen will be 389 ppi #JustSayingThe new Apple A8

processor will run at 2.6 GHz. #JustSayingAnd finally: These specs could be the

real thing #JustSaying Indeed they could be. But Dickson gave no source, not

even a hint of a source, for these claims. There was no companion post at his

now-much-slicker Website. Now, it even comes with advertising..



For iClarified.com, which picked up on the Dickson tweets, he is a "reputable

source of Apple leaks in the past." For handy comparison, the post notes that

"the iPhone 5s is 0.30 inches thick, has a Retina Display with 326 ppi, and an

A7 processor that runs at 1.3GHz."



"Sonny has been responsible for a number of component and detail leaks in the

past, so people tend to listen when he says he has some inside information,"

explains iDownloadBlog's Cody Lee.  When you have a rep like that, your inside

information speaks for itself.



Dickson's claims are plausible. So are almost any others one could make up. But

plausibility only gets us so far. As "Sonny" himself tweeted, these specs could

be the real thing.



Or not.
