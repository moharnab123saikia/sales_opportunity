Steve Jobs gave people what they wanted before they knew they wanted it. Apple

now gives all the options or them to choose from, Krishna Bahirwani explores

what one can expect from Apple's new offerings.



Get ready for  iPhone 6, iPhone 6 plus and Apple Watch



For the first time since its invention Apple has decided to adopt a different

strategy with the new, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. I'm not talking about the

Apple-designed A8 chip with second generation 64-bit desktop-class architecture

and advanced iSight and FaceTime HD cameras or even the "ultrafast" wireless

technologies or even Apple Pay , an easier way to simply and securely make

payments with just the touch with iOS 8, the latest version of Apple's operating

system.I'm talking about the design and concept, ever since its inception the

iPhone has always been one phone for each  generation with an exception of

different storage capacities but this time there are two different phones which

takes away from the singularity of the "iPhone".



"iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are the biggest advancements in iPhone history,"

said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "The iPhone is the most loved smartphone in the

world with the highest customer satisfaction in the industry and we are making

it much better in every way. Only Apple can combine the best hardware, software

and services at this unprecedented level and we think customers are going to

love it."



The iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch Retina HD display with 1334 x 750 resolution,

which is designed to provide a 38 percent more viewing area than iPhone 5s. The

iPhone 6 Plus features an even bigger 5.5-inch Retina HD display with 1920 x

1080 resolution, providing 88 percent more viewing area and nearly three times

the pixels than iPhone 5s.



Although both the phones have cameras with the new sensor featuring Focus Pixels

, iPhone 6 Plus get optical image stabilization technology that compensates for

shaky hands. The iPhone 6 Plus also has a higher battery capacity ,because of

the larger screen size which possibly consumes more power it cannot be said if

the increased battery capacity will benifit its users in terms of time to surf

the web or watching videos.The iPhone 6 Plus also features a landscape mode

similar to the iPad where apps can work when the phone is held horizontally .



Having two phones has created a divide within the iPhone users having to make a

choice which they never had to today. As of today iPhone 6 Plus is sold out with

Apple and carrier online stores, much before the the 4.7-inch iPhone 6. The

exact quanitity of the number of iPhone 6 Plus sold or even the iPhone 6 is

unknown and therefore it is difficult to accertain  if there were lesser

quanitites of iPhone 6 Plus made.



It cannot be said if this strategy will help them get more of a market share or

if it will make Apple bend towards the "phablet" market or if making two

different models was a bad move.

Apple has officially made its entry into the smartwatch industry with the Apple

Watch which they are dubbing as their most personal device ever Apple Watch

features the digital crown, a new way of interaction following on the footsteps

of the iPod Click Wheel and iPhone Multi-Touch. The Digital Crown provides an

innovative way to scroll, zoom and navigate. Apple Watch makes your wrist the

center of your communication by sending and receiving messages, answering calls

to your iPhone, and with Digital Touch, sending something as personal as your

own heartbeat all from your wrist. Apple Watch also wants you to be healthy with

a whole new set of health and fitness apps. Apple Watch has three versions,

Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition.



"Apple introduced the world to several category-defining products, the Mac,

iPod, iPhone and iPad," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "And once again Apple is

poised to captivate the world with a revolutionary product that can enrich

people's lives. It's the most personal product we've ever made."



"With Apple Watch, we've developed multiple technologies and an entirely new

user interface specifically for a device that's designed to be worn. It blurs

the boundary between physical object and user interface," said Jony Ive, Apple's

senior vice president of Design. "We've created an entire range of products that

enable unparalleled personalisation."



Apple Watch has an iOS-based user interface created specifically for a smaller

device with the digital crown serving as the home button and a convenient way to

access Siri. Apple Watch comes in three  versions, Apple Watch, Apple Watch

Sport and Apple Watch Edition and is available in two sizes, 38 mm and 42 mm.



Apple is giving you all the choice you need with the Apple Watch with enclosures

of the made from custom alloys of polished or space black stainless steel, space

gray or silver anodised aluminium and 18-karat rose or yellow gold. When it

comes to watch straps you get everything from stainless steel to leather as an

option. The customization doesn't stop there with 11 watch faces ranging from

traditional analog faces to new faces like the dynamic Timelapse face which can

also be further personalized allowing the Apple Watch to become an extension of

your personality.



Taking advantage of its location on your wrist, Apple Watch gives you all the

information you need like directions or current locations at a glance which you

can interact with using your hand or your voice.  Apple Watch also includes a

groundbreaking Activity app which offers calories burned, brisk activity and how

often you stand up during the day and another Workout provides goal-setting and

pacing during popular session-based workouts, such as running and cycling. The

companion Fitness app on iPhone collects your activity data so you can see your

activity history in greater detail. Apple Watch uses this history to suggest

personal, realistic goals, reward fitness milestones and keep you

motivated.Available at 350$ in the US, the device definitely packs bang for the

buck.
