Competition in the highend, largescreen smartphone market looks set to be fierce

over the next six months due to the muchawaited arrival of the Apple iPhone 6

and Samsung Galaxy Note 4.



Smartphone sales in Thailand are likely to hit 14 million units this year in a

market worth 100 billion baht, making the country one of the world's most

attractive smartphone markets, said Jarit Sidhu, senior analyst of IDC Thailand.



Thailand has topped Southeast Asia's iPhone sales for two consecutive years.



Apple Inc late on Monday announced Oct 31 as the Thailand launch date of the

iPhone 6, its first foray into the bigscreen smartphone realm which is currently

dominated by South Korea's Samsung.



Local mobile operators have announced they will allow people to order the new

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on Oct 24 on their websites.



Apple said it sold 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone Plus models in the first three

days of availability.



Samsung has high hopes of selling up to 15 million units of its new Galaxy Note

4 in the first month of global release. In comparison, Samsung sold 10 million

units of the Galaxy Note 3 in the first two months of availability and shifted

11 million Galaxy S5 units within the first month.



Mr Jarit said the two largest smartphone makers in the world were focusing on

premium smartphones instead of tablets, the market for which continues to shrink

as largescreen smartphones eat up their market share.



Wichai Pornpratang, vicepresident for IT and mobile communications at Thai

Samsung Electronics Co, said it had allocated an extra 20% budget for marketing

to promote the Galaxy Note 4.



The additional marketing budget is aimed at promoting its new S Pen technology,

which lets users write, draw and even paint with accuracy.



Some surveys in Thailand show 40% of respondents prefer phones with larger

screens, while another 40% prefer digital pens.



Mr Wichai said Samsung would retail its Galaxy Note 4 here on Saturday at 25,900

baht.



"We expect smartphones with over fiveinch screens to be a highgrowth segment,"

he said, adding that such models were expected to contribute 17.8% of overall

smartphone sales this year.
