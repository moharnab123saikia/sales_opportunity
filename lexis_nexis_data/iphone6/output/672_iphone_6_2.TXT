Apple's new iPhones, facing an Internet outcry about their malleability, proved
difficult to bend and fit for daily use in lab tests run by Consumer Reports
magazine.

Stress tests on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, along with comparable smartphones from
competitors, showed that it took "significant force" to damage any of the
devices, Consumer Reports said in results of a study published on its website.
HTC's HTC One M8 and Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 were among the other devices.

"All the phones we tested showed themselves to be pretty tough," the report
said. "We expect that any of these phones should stand up to typical use."

Following uproar in social media including claims the new iPhone 6 Plus bends if
it is sat upon or if enough pressure is placed on it, Apple has said bending of
its devices is "extremely rare".

Only nine customers had contacted Apple about a bent iPhone 6 Plus, the company
said in a statement.

The iPhone 6 Plus began to deform after 41 kilos of force was applied and the
iPhone 6 stood up to pressure until 31.7 kilos was applied, the same as the HTC
One M8, according to Consumer Reports. The Galaxy Note 3 was damaged at 68
kilos. All devices withstood 25 kilos, the force needed to break three pencils,
the magazine said.

"Bear in mind that it took significant force to do this kind of damage to all
these phones," Consumer Reports said.

"Both iPhones seem tougher than the Internet fracas implies."

The iPhone 6 Plus, a 14-centimetre screen device, which is the biggest
smartphone in Apple's line-up, became available for sale last week, along with
the other new model, the iPhone 6.
