Monday, March 09, 2015: Apple knows that it has an established market in India,
despite the fact that it has some of the most expensive offerings to make. With
the confidence, Apple has increased the prices of its iPhone devices in India.
The price hike comes almost a week after the Indian government presented its
annual budget.

Apple has hiked the prices of all its iPhones by up to Rs 2,500 in the country.
With the price hike, iPhone 5S will cost Rs 47,000, iPhone 6 is priced at Rs
56,000 and iPhone 6 Plus will be available at Rs 65,000.

The news of the price hike was confirmed by Apple's retail channel partners.
However, when TOI approached the Apple spokesperson, no confirmation could be
ascertained. It is worth mentioning here that the price hike of the iPhones
comes after the Indian government proposed a hike in excise duty on mobile
phones imported into India to 12.5 per cent from existing 6 per cent. With this
move, the Indian government aims to improve the local manufacturing in the union
budget.

Let's take a look at the revised prices of the iPhone devices in India. iPhone
5S 32GB will now be available at Rs 51,500 (old price - Rs 49500). iPhone 6 16GB
gets a Rs 2,500 hike while its 64GB will now cost Rs 65000 (old price - Rs
62,500) and the 128GB version will be available at Rs 74,000 (old price - Rs
71,500).

The iPhone 6 Plus will now cost Rs 65,000 for 16GB, Rs 74,000 for 64GB and Rs
83,000 for 128GB models, a hike of Rs 2,500.
