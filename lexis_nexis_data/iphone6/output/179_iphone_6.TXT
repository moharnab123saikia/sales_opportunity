The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are the thinnest iPhones ever made, with 6.8mm

and 7.1mm thickness respectively.



Saturday, February 14, 2015: If you still haven't thought of what to gift to

your loved one this Valentine's Day, we can suggest something, that is pretty

luxurious and exclusive. Goldgenie, a company that is known for customising

high-end technological products, has launched a 24K Gold iPhone 6 Diamond

Ecstasy limited edition for this day of love.



The website claims that the phone will be customised as per the demand of the

buyer and will cost anything from $15,000, to a whopping $3.5 million. The

customised iPhone from Goldgenie will be available in choices of 24-carat gold,

rose gold or platinum. If the user wants, it can have a laser-engraved message

on the rear of the device.



Lets take a quick recap of the specifications of iPhone models in questions. The

two variants of recently launched iPhone, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus come

with an 11.9-cm (4.7-inch) and 13.97-cm (5.5-inch) displays respectively. While

the iPhone 6 offers a resolution of 1334X750p, the iPhone 6 Plus offers a

resolution of 1920X1080P. These two are the thinnest iPhones ever made, with

6.8mm and 7.1mm thickness respectively.



Apple claims that iPhone 6 is 50 per cent more energy efficient due to its new

A8 processor. A8 processor from Apple is based on 64-bit CPU architecture and is

20 per cent faster in application processing and 50 per cent faster in rendering

graphics. Performance-intensive tasks like playing a game at higher frame rates

are easily sustained by this smartphone. The two new iPhones comes with 8MP

iSight camera, that offers phase detection. This camera allows the users to

shoot 43MP panorama photos.
