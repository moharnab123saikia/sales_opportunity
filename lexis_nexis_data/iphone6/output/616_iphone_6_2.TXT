The iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus are now available to pre-order from both the

telcos in the UAE. Etisalat and du have both of the latest phones from Apple on

their website with a release date set for September 27. Apple's UAE store is

also reporting the same release date but there is no option to pre-order,

although, prices are a bit lower when ordering directly from Apple compared to

Etisalat and du. Interesting, there are no packaged deals for subsidised prices

from du or Etisalat this year and you have to pay the full price of the device

upfront whether you chose the pre-paid or post-paid option.



The following table compares the prices (in AED) for Apple UAE Store as well as

Etisalat and du:
