Blayne Slabbert takes a look at the market for secondhand iPhones.



--------------------



Next week, Tim Cook will stand on a stage in San Francisco to unveil a new

iPhone model.



Shortly after the Apple chief executive delivers his speech, some of you will

start wondering about upgrading your current iPhone.



But what is it worth, and what can you expect to pay secondhand for older

iPhones models?



Figures from auction website Trade Me show there is a spike in searches for

iPhones after each new model is released.



However, data from January to June this year shows that while about 100,000

iPhones were listed on the New Zealand site, it's not always the latest models

that get the most attention.



The results show the iPhone 5 was the most popular handset in terms of the

number of listings created over that period. This was followed by the iPhone 5S

(2013), the iPhone 4S (2011), and then the iPhone 6 (2014) in fourth place.



The most purchased iPhone model over that same timeframe was the iPhone 5,

followed closely by the iPhone 5S, and the iPhone 4S. In fourth place again was

the iPhone 6.



The demand for smaller, more affordable iPhones possibly shows that Apple made a

smart move by releasing the 4-inch iPhone SE earlier this year.



However, people still covet the latest handsets, with data showing Apple's 6

model is the most popular when it comes to searches.



Here's what to expect if you do plan on selling your iPhone secondhand. The

prices reflect devices in good to excellent condition with no dents or cracks.



iPhone 4S



This model is really getting dated now. In October, it'll be five years old,

which in smartphone years means it's due for the retirement home.



However, Apple has made an effort to keep the 4S current and it is compatible

with the latest operating system that is due to be released next week.



The screen is tiny - 3.5-inches - but you still get a good phone that was worth

$1049 when it first went on sale. However, expect its resale value to decline.



Secondhand: $150 (8GB) - $300 (16GB).



New: Not available to buy new anymore.



iPhone 5



Since this is the most listed phone on Trade Me, it appears many people are

selling it to upgrade.



There will probably be more listings after the next model is announced so if you

are after a 5, it may be a good time to get a deal.



It's still a great phone and is quite a bit better than the 4S. It's got a

bigger screen, 4G and its twice as fast, which is why many are still buying them

on Trade Me.



Secondhand: $250 (16GB) - $450 (32GB).



New: Not available to buy new anymore.



iPhone 5C



This plastic-backed model is still popular and is a great entry-level device.



However, there is a lot of 5C iPhones on Trade Me so it could take a while to

sell. Any first-time smartphone owner would be happy with this device.



Secondhand: $250 (8GB) - $380 (16GB).



New: Not available to buy new anymore.



iPhone 5s



There is little difference between this model and the 5, but it still sells for

more. There are hundreds of these listed on Trade Me which is good if you are

looking for one to buy.



Secondhand: $300 (16GB) - $600 (64GB).



New: Not available to buy new anymore.



iPhone 6 (2015)



This was the first model to feature a larger 4.7-inch screen and it proved a

sales winner for Apple.



Trade Me data shows this model is the most popular in terms of search.



This may be good news for all those after a 6 as a new iPhone coming on the

market will mean more older devices going on sale.



The 6-Plus models sell for about $200 more.



Secondhand: $500 (16GB) - $900 (64GB).



New: $999 (16GB) - $1199 (64GB).



iPhone 6S



If you are selling a 6S to upgrade to what will probably be the iPhone 7, then

you're probably an early adopter and are not worried about spending money on a

new phone.



If the new model proves a winner, then you may see a flurry of the 6S devices

coming on the market as other fans rush to upgrade.



The Plus models sell for about $200 more.



Secondhand: $800 (16GB) - $1100 (64GB).



New: $1199 (16GB), $1399 (64GB), $1599 (128GB).



iPhone SE



The most recent addition to Apple's iPhone lineup. It went on sale only in March

so unless you're having major regrets about your current model's screen size,

it's hard to see why you'd really want to upgrade.



However, if you're looking to buy an iPhone SE secondhand, you don't have much

choice. There's only a few of these listed for sale on Trade Me at any one time.



Secondhand: $650 (16GB) - $850 (64GB).



New: $749 (16GB) - $949 (64GB).

Apple's iPhone 5C model is still popular and it's a great entry-level device for
