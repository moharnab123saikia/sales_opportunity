Sapphire Displays For New iPhone 6?

Good news for users tired of their iPhone screens getting scratched by their car

keys: Apple is preparing to use supertough, scratch-resistant sapphire displays

on the upcoming iPhone 6.



Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri says his supply-chain checks in Asia indicate Apple

will use sapphire crystal displays for both sizes of its rumored larger-screen

iPhone 6, but not all versions. He says versions of the 4.7-inch model might use

a mix of Corning Gorilla Glass, the incumbent supplier, and new sapphire

displays from its supply deal with GT Advanced Technologies.



At least one, if not all, versions of the jumbo-sized, 5.5-inch iPhone 6 will

use sapphire displays, he said.



Pricing will be tiered for the iPhone 6 models, he said, but it's unclear how

the sapphire displays might boost pricing.



Arcuri is expecting a traditional September launch for the iPhone 6 as well as a

wearable device.



But Taiwan's Economic Daily News on Tuesday claimed that only the larger

5.5-inch iPhone 6 will include a sapphire display due to production limitations.

The Taiwanese news service said Apple only had enough sapphire displays for the

5.5-inch iPhone 6 and the iWatch wearable.
