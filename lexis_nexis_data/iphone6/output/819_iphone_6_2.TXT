A barrel of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team



iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus: preliminary results && AnandTech



While we're still working on the full review, I want to get out some preliminary

results for the iPhone 6. For now, this means some basic performance data and

battery life, which include browser benchmarks, game-type benchmarks, and our

standard web browsing battery life test. There's definitely a lot more to talk

about for this phone, but this should give an idea of what to expect in the full

review. To start, we'll look at the browser benchmarks, which can serve as a

relatively useful proxy for CPU performance.



If you like benchmarks, here are some.



Mandatory Google+ Gmail integration quietly shelved && WordStream



Rumours of the decoupling of Google+ and Gmail first surfaced in the spring.

Google, unsurprisingly, hasn't exactly gone out of its way to shout about the

change from the rooftops, instead choosing to quietly shelve the mandatory

integration which had previously been in place since 2012. Although the change

means that new Gmail users will no longer be forced to sign up for Google+,

they'll still have the option to do so, as you can see in the image above.



Conscious uncoupling?



Apple iPhone 6 Plus second impressions && SuperSite for Windows



Paul Thurrott:



Regarding the camera, I went to Twitter yesterday and foolishly announced that

"it's easily and readily apparent that the iPhone 6 Plus camera is no match for

the Lumia 1020, 1520 or Icon/930." I'd like to clarify that statement now. I was

referring to overall camera quality there: With their superior 41 megapixel

(Lumia 1020) and 20 megapixel (Lumia 1520, Icon/930) cameras, Microsoft's

high-end Lumia handsets can produce better photos than can the iPhone 6. But

camera quality isn't just about picture quality. And the iPhone 6 Plus's camera

in particular can take excellent photos while offering a number of advantages

over the high-end Lumias. In fact, it's pretty clear that the iPhone 6 Plus is

the better overall choice for most people.



iOS app devs warn customers off iOS 8's iCloud Drive && Computerworld



Gregg Keizer:



Essentially, iCloud Drive is Apple's response to Dropbox and other services,

which show the cloud-based storage and its files in an OS's file manager.



When users upgrade to iOS 8 today and after, they'll be offered to update

iCloud's current storage structure to iCloud Drive. (Anyone who has tried OS X

Yosemite, either the developer previews or the public beta, has seen the same

message.) Several iOS app developers told their customers not to take Apple up

on the iCloud Drive offer, as doing so will make it impossible to synchronize

with their apps on devices not running iOS 8, or with Macs running OS X

Mavericks or earlier.



Mavericks is the current latest production version of OS X.



"When you upgrade to iOS 8, you need to ensure that you choose the right iCloud

Drive option to ensure that Clear for iOS continues to sync with Clear for Mac,"

said Realmac, the maker of the to-do app Clear, in a blog post today. "If you

upgrade to iCloud Drive, you will only be able to sync with devices running iOS

8 or OS X Yosemite."



If iCloud Drive isn't backported to Mavericks, it's going to cause problems.



The reasons why the networks abandoned Phones4u && Matt Aguilera



My experience and from others I have spoken to is that the service by Phones4u

was abysmal. Having worked at a Phones4u call centre briefly. I can only confirm

what I saw to be completely broken. If you weren't buying a new contract today,

you would be fobbed off and quickly too. You know you have a broken, strange

culture when a sitcom [Phone Shop] can be made about your industry and be

cringe-inducingly accurate. Some people who have walked into a Phones4u store

will have experienced something out of Phone Shop at some point. The aggressive

sales tactics and selfish agenda gave Phones4u the reputation of being a place

to avoid. Rightly so. The networks had now got their own slick sales processes

in place and knew what tricks they were up against. The public knew it too and

joined in with the in-jokes of Phone Shop. Getting locked into high-tariff

contracts and being offered insurance that you can cancel in 3 months (so the

salesman got their commission). It all happened.



FBI investigating death threats against Feminist Frequency creator Sarkeesian &&

Polygon



The FBI is investigating death threats and online abuse that Feminist

Frequency's Tropes vs Women in Games creator Anita Sarkeesian says drove her out

of her home last month, a San Francisco police spokesperson confirmed to

Polygon. San Francisco police public information officer Albie Esparza told

Polygon that Sarkeesian had filed a report with the police department about the

threats she received online and that the police department handed the

information to the FBI for investigation. Esparza declined to release any other

details, saying that doing so could compromise the investigation or the safety

of the victim. He also noted that the FBI is the primary agency handling the

case. An FBI spokesman told Polygon that the bureau's policy is to neither

confirm nor deny any investigation they may be conducting.



Other parts of the story suggest the FBI is taking a lot of notice of what's

going on.



Samsung, LG's conflict deepens && Korea Times



A conflict between Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics is escalating. The row

was triggered last week by alleged vandalism by LG executives on Samsung's

washers during an industry fair in Berlin, Germany earlier this month. In a new

twist, the prosecution said it is investigating allegations that former LG

executives pocketed Samsung's confidential air-conditioner business plan related

to a government-run project.



It's like something out of a film. Possibly the film that comes on before the

film you actually paid to watch.



Commercial replacement demand upholding global PC shipments in 2014, says MIC &&

Digitimes



Shipment volume of global PC systems - comprising of notebooks and desktops - is

forecast to reach around 299m units in 2014, down 0.1% on year, according to

Market Intelligence & Consulting (MIC). The global PC industry has been

bolstered mainly by the PC replacement demand in the commercial market in 2014.

Looking at the performance by sector, with the majority of desktop PCs shipped

being commercial ones, desktops have played a significant role to bolster global

PC shipments in 2014. Global desktop shipment volume is estimated at 130m units

in 2014, up 3.1% on year. Though continuing eroded by tablets, the notebook

industry has seen its shipment decline slowly in 2014. The notebook shipment

volume is anticipated to top around 168m units, down 2.5% on year. Notebooks'

share of total PC products is expected to slip to 56.2% in 2014, down from 57.6%

in 2013.



Asustek, Gigabyte unlikely to achieve motherboard shipment goals for 3Q14 &&

Digitimes



Neither Asustek Computer nor Gigabyte Technology is likely to be able to achieve

their 5.8m motherboard shipment targets for the third quarter, as demand in

China remains weak and the retail channel's orders ahead of China's National Day

holidays have been also worse than those of previous years, according market

sources. Asustek and Gigabyte are expected to ship around 5.6m motherboards each

in the third quarter, the sources said.



Now the PC squeeze is hitting the replacement/self-build business too.



Exclusive: U2 and Apple have another surprise for you && TIME



As an article in the new issue of TIME reveals, Bono, Edge, Adam Clayton and

Larry Mullen Jr believe so strongly that artists should be compensated for their

work that they have embarked on a secret project with Apple to try to make that

happen, no easy task when free-to-access music is everywhere (no) thanks to

piracy and legitimate websites such as YouTube. Bono tells TIME he hopes that a

new digital music format in the works will prove so irresistibly exciting to

music fans that it will tempt them again into buying music--whole albums as well

as individual tracks. The point isn't just to help U2 but less well known

artists and others in the industry who can't make money, as U2 does, from live

performance. "Songwriters aren't touring people," says Bono. "Cole Porter

wouldn't have sold T-shirts. Cole Porter wasn't coming to a stadium near you."



The point about songwriters is valid (and generally overlooked by those who say

"play live gigs!" is the answer), but a new music format? DRM on music keeps

failing because people like sharing music. (The article also contains U2's

reactions to the social media reaction to their album release.)
