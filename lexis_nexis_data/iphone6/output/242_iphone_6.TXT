MacRumors (http://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/09/iphone-6s-1715mah-battery/) The
report is based on Apple (http://indianexpress.com/tag/apple/)'s introducing
iPhone 6s video, where the camera briefly lingers on the battery and users can
see the number 1715 etched on the battery.

This would mean that the iPhone 6s' battery is less than the iPhone 6 which had
a battery capacity of 1810 mAh.

The report adds that Apple has also cut down the iPhone 6s Plus' battery to 2750
mAh from the 2910 mAh in the previous version, although this is yet to be
confirmed.

Apple had said at the launch event that the iPhone 6s battery life would be the
same as the iPhone 6, but the smaller battery size has raised concerned. Apple's
iPhone 6s comes with 3D Touch Display, 12 mp camera, 5 mp front camera, a faster
A9 chip and support for 4K recording.

Battery life has always been the weak point for the Apple's iPhones although the
iPhone 6 saw a marked improvement with up to 14 hours talktime and 10 hours of
Internet use being promised on 3G networks. More details about the Apple iPhone
6s and iPhone 6s Plus battery should emerge once the tear-downs begin post
September 25, when the smartphones go on sale.
