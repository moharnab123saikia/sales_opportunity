passed a whopping four million pre-orders in first 24 hours after the phones
went up on pre-orders. These new phones have broken all the previous pre-order
records set by iPhone.

Tim Cook, Apple's CEO has said that "Pre-orders for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus
set a new record for Apple, and we can't wait to get our best iPhones yet into
the hands of customers starting this Friday."

The company mentions that though it will start delivering a significant amount
of phones beginning this Friday (September 19) and will continue doing so
throughout September, some iPhone pre-orders will be delivered in October.

Consumers will also be able to buy iPhones on apple retail store from September
19, though people might not receive the units immediately as the delivery of
these will depend on stock available at the time of purchase.

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be available in the US, Australia, Canada,
France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK beginning
this Friday, September 19. In addition to that, the company has also mentioned
the name of those 20 countries in which the sale for new iPhones will begin on
September 26. These countries include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
Ireland, Isle of Man, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and United Arab Emirates. This further kills even
the slightest of hope around Apple iPhone 6's India launch in September.
