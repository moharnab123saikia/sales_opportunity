iPhone 6 rumor rollup for the week ending April 18;

Super Siri, strange price hike, clues in cases and batteries

The iOSphere this past week wondered at the prospect of iPhone 6 with a

Supercharged Siri, an all-knowing, all-doingsoftware entity that will manage

your iOS life for you. Eventually, probably in iOS 9, Siri will offer

psychotherapy.



The Bummer of the Week was a confused, and confusedly reported, rumor that Apple

is negotiating with carriers to raise the iPhone 6 price by $100. Why Apple

would need carrier by-in to price its smartphone was unclear. The rumor resulted

in something rarely seen: cheers for the carriers, who according to the Wall

Street analyst who floated the context-less rumor, were supposedly resisting the

hike.



Bloggers and tech websites also eagerly sifted through anonymous photos of

third-party phone cases, "specially designed for the iPhone 6," and bigger

batteries that, although they could be for any smartphone, if you think of them

as being for the iPhone 6, show that the iPhone body would have to be larger,

too.



It's simple really.



You read it here second.



iPhone 6 will have "supercharged" Siri This is less a rumor than a hope. It's

based on listing the various ways in which Apple's Siri voice assistant lacks

certain features found in rivals, such as Google Now and Microsoft's

just-announced Cortana, and looking at some Apple acquisitions.



Neither technique really guarantees what we'll see in Siri with the next release

of iOS.



This latest comparison is a Slashgear post by Chris Davies, who uses the space

to mainly rehash and link to various earlier Slashgear posts on this general

topic.



As did many others, Davies points again to Apple's recently disclosed

acquisition of Novauris Technologies, a startup created by Dragon Systems

co-founder James Baker, which reportedly is working on an automatic speech

recognition system that runs partly on the client device and partly in the

cloud.



"Local speech processing is one of the elements that rivals to Siri have cited

as key advantages," Davies claims. "Rather than waiting for server-side

analysis, for instance, Intel's Jarvis voice control can do it on the wearable

itself."



The other elements of the "supercharged" Siri would be a personalized calendar,

via Apple's acquisition of Cue, integration with the Shazam audio database for

music recognition, and a Siri API, which would let third-party app developers

tap into Siri. Apple is "believed to be readying" this, according to Davies.



Davies seems to be borrowing the API stuff from a TechCrunch post by Darrell

Etherington, who in turn is, openly, borrowing from a subscription-only original

article, "Apps Emerge as Key Battleground in Mobile Search," at The Information,

a high-profile news startup focusing on the technology business.



That article, as Etherrington notes, looks at Siri as part of a larger analysis

of the evolving mobile search/app integration space. As such, Siri is likely to

become "smarter" and more capable - relating apps, calendars, and personalized

information to tasks carried out on behalf of the user, sometimes in cooperation

with third-party apps or online services.



In that sense, Siri becomes a growing part of the end-user "infrastructure" of

Apple iOS users, analogous to Apple's extension of iOS location services by

means of the iBeacon software framework for Bluetooth Low Energy radios on iOS

devices, opening them up to interacting with third-party BTLE beacons,

notifications, and apps and other content.



As a human-machine interface, Siri is a work in progress, and there's no

indication that Apple has given up on it or made it a lesser priority.



iPhone 6 will be $100 more expensive than the iPhone 5s Business Insider's Jay

Yarrow thinks Apple is "too focused on profits."



That's his conclusion, in a blog post titled "Apple Reportedly Wants To Raise

The Price Of The iPhone By $100," about a claim put forward by Jefferies stock

analyst Peter Misek. According to Yarrow's post, Misek says, "Our checks

indicate Apple has started negotiating with carriers on a $100 iPhone 6 price

increase. The initial response has been no, but there seems to be an admission

that there is no other game-changing device this year."



"Because the iPhone is the only phone that matters this year, carriers may cave

and give Apple the price bump it wants," Yarrow concludes. This strikes The

Rollup as a fundamental misunderstanding of Apple's relationship with the

carriers. About 70 percent of Apple's iPhone business is transacted mainly

through carriers and some retailers.



There's a lot about this relationship that's not clear. In general, the

conviction is that mobile carriers pay Apple something close to the full retail

price of each iPhone, which they then sell to subscribers for less, if the phone

is bought with a two-year contract: the starting price iPhone 5s is $199, with a

contract, for example. There are additional costs for the carriers: as part of

the deal, Apple requires carriers to commit to TV and print advertising, set up

an "exclusion zone" around the iPhone display space to keep other products

further away, and dedicate customer service staff specifically for Apple

products, at least according to this July 2013 article in The Telegraph, which

examined Apple's terms with European carriers.



As importantly, Apple apparently requires a "minimum order quantity" or MOQ from

carriers, which seems to be a percentage of their total subscriber base. (See

Horace Dediu's analysis of this at his Asymco blog).



None of this suggests that Apple negotiates the iPhone "price" with carriers.

They can negotiate, or try to, the amount of the "subsidy" - the difference

between what the carriers charge their subscribers for an iPhone and what Apple

charges the carriers. So far, they've been willing to pay that, because of the

phone's popularity and because of the data usage patterns of iPhone users - they

use a lot, and if they're on LTE, they use even more.



Yarrow seems to assume that Apple simply intends to raise by $100 the price of

whatever the iPhone 6 turns out to be. "But really, for a company with $150

billion in cash, adding $100 to the price of its phone seems like a move that's

too focused on profits," he declares.



"This seems like a strange move for Apple," Yarrow writes. "At a time when its

rivals are going down in price, Apple wants to go up." But then he undermines

his own argument by noting that "Samsung's phablet, the 6-inch Galaxy Note 3

sells for $100 more than its 5-inch Galaxy S5."



UPI's Ananth Baliga wrote a story based on the same Misek Note To Investors, but

added one detail missing from Yarrow's account.



"According to the note the extra cost will be split between the customer and

carrier, with each asked to pay $50," she says.



"The iPhone 5S is currently sold at a subsidized rate of $200 with a standard

two-year contract. If the price increase were to take place, customers would

have to pay $250 for the new phone."



It remains very unclear whether, or how, Apple will extend the iPhone portfolio

in 2014. It currently has two models, the flagship 5s and the lower-priced 5c,

both with 4-inch diagonal screens. Many people are expecting two new iPhones by

the end of 2014, both with screens larger than that. But would that mean Apple

does away with the 4-inch display completely? Would a 4.7-inch iPhone become the

new "5c" and a 5.5- or 6-inch iPhone the new "5s?" Or do both phones migrate to

a 4.7-inch screen and a new, third model offers a 5-inch-or-larger screen, at a

price hike?



And what, actually, is strange about charging more for a phone that's more

expensive to produce, if consumers see, and are willing to pay for, added value?



iPhone 6 will have 4.7-inch screen, as revealed by anonymous third-party phone

cases Thank heavens someone is tracking the trends in Purported iPhone 6 Cases.



And why? Because "Purported iPhone 6 cases suggest design changes," according to

the CNET post by Don Reisinger.



"Photos of purported iPhone 6 cases have popped up on the Web and seem to show

features that have been rumored over the last several months," he announces.



"The cases, made by an unidentified third-party and specifically designed for

the iPhone 6, feature the same design in a few colors," he reveals. "They come

with a screen opening of 4.7 inches and a new location for the power switch from

the top of the iPhone to the side. The cases also include rectangular volume

controls on the opposite side of the power button. An opening for Apple's logo

and another for a camera are also in the cases."



Reisinger gets this from 9to5Mac, which got it from the French site

NoWhereElse.fr, which in turn picked up from the Japanese Mac fan site, Mac

Otakara.



NoWhereElse's Steve Hemmerstoffer exhibits an almost compulsive attention to

details, measuring and annotating everything and drawing conclusions. The

assumption behind all these posts is that companies making money selling

protective cases for iPhones have an interest in getting accurate information so

they can pre-design and manufacture cases for the Next iPhone before anyone

else.



Here's the Google translation of part of the research and analysis from

NoWhereElse: "Designed on the basis of information obtained from a source kept

secret, these shells are supposed silicone perfect fit an iPhone 6 with a screen

measuring 4.7 inches diagonally. Wishing to avoid that these data may allow a

more props to manufacture their own products, my contact was unfortunately not

want to give me the exact dimensions of these hulls ..."



Makes perfect sense to us: secret sources, alleged or purported photos, no exact

dimensions. No, you know, facts. The perfect rumor.



iPhone 6 will be bigger because photos show bigger batteries It was busy week

for Hemmerstoffer's NoWhereElse blog, which was also the source of photos

supposedly showing the batteries for the iPhone 6. The batteries are bigger than

the batteries in today's iPhones, therefore the Next iPhone must be bigger, too.



To lend credence to this imagining, the post notes that (via Google Translate of

the original French) "End of March, Aaron Lee and Joseph Tsai of Digitimes

claimed Apple would at already placed orders with suppliers of batteries under

the production of its future iPhone 6, according to Hemmerstoffer. "Imagine a

picture that you was passed earlier in the morning seems to confirm the rumor

launched by the Taiwanese website ...The photo in question is supposed to

introduce ourselves batteries or to equip the next iPhone. These batteries could

of course have been designed for any other smartphone but admit for a moment

that my source is telling the truth ..."



Wait. What? "These batteries could of course have been designed for any other

smartphone?"



But we can get past that, by admitting - for a moment - that his source is

telling the truth. Why would he lie, right?



"In examining these batteries more closely, you will actually realize that a

mysterious metallic elements missing from current models has been integrated

alongside the + and - terminals whose positioning has also been slightly

modified," Hemmerstoffer notes. "A hole was drilled at the end of this new

element, I guess it will fix the battery housing of the device." So by examining

the mysterious details, we can see that these batteries that could be for any

smartphone are indeed different from the battery in the current iPhone.



"Assuming that the batteries that have led me to write this article are indeed

intended to supply the iPhone 6, it could therefore be effectively presented in

approximately three months either in the month of July ... Wait & See ..."



If we all just waited and saw what Apple actually announces for the 2014 iPhone,

life would be so much simpler.
