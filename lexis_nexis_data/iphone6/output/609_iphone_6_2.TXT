SECTION: C,C; Pg. 20



LENGTH: 149 words





What: iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones     Likes: Big new screens; thin,

lightweight designs; longer battery life, particularly on the 6 Plus;

split-screen viewing in iPhone 6 Plus; much faster autofocus in camera; faster

processors and wireless radios.     Dislikes: iPhone 6 Plus is too big to hold

easily and comfortably in one average-sized hand; one key new feature - Apple

Pay - won't work until next month; entry level models have too little storage

space.     Specs: 64-bit dual-core processors; 4.7-inch, 1334 x 750 pixel screen

(on the iPhone 6); 5.5-inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel screen on (on the 6 Plus);

1.2-megapixel front and 8-megapixel rear cameras.     Price: For iPhone 6 with a

two-year contract: $200, for 16-gigabyte, $300 for 64-gigabyte and $400 for

128-gigabyte models. For iPhone 6 Plus, $300 for 16-gigabyte, $400 for

64-gigabyte and $500 for 128-gigabyte models.
