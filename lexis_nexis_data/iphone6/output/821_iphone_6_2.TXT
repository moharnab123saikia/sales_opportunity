Dubai: Gitex Shopper opened with none of the key retailers having iPhones at

their stands due to the limited quantities supplied to them by the telco

operators.



Retailers ran out of stock within the first one hour of sale at major malls on

Saturday at midnight.



Most of the them -- Jacky's, Jumbo, Virgin Mega Store, iStyle, Emax, Sharaf DG

and Plug Ins -- and the telco operators kept their outlets opened for the Apple

aficionados as some of them [retailers and telcos] had started pre-bookings from

September 18.



An industry source said the telco operators did not allocate enough stocks to

the retailers as they [operators] want customers to buy from them. All the major

retailers apart from iStyle and Virgin Mega Store got around 350 pieces.



Neelesh Bhatnagar, CEO of Emax, said that the quantities were not enough to meet

the strong demand.



He said the next batch is expected within two or three days.



Both the telco operators have confirmed that iPhone sales are ongoing and that

they have enough stocks.



Etisalat offered its contract packages for the buyers with zero down payment but

du has different options.



Du's website says that for a 12-month contract, a customer pays for only six

months -- every other month -- with Smart Plan or Emirati Plan starting at DH250

for a two-year contract.



Under the Smart Plan, users get 2,500 flexible minutes for national or

international calls; 10 GB of data and 300 minutes free to call a preferred

number on any network in the UAE.



Under the Emirati plan, du offers up to 2,000 national minutes, up to 2 GB of

data, up to 1000 SMS every month and Dh1.45/minute for international calls to

190 destinations.



Pre-bookings



The telco operators have priced the iPhone 6 without contract at Dh2,749 for

16GB; Dh3,149 for 64GB; Dh3,549 for 128GB while the iPhone 6 Plus at Dh3,149 for

16GB; Dh3,549 for 64GB and Dh3,949 for 128GB.



Retailers have started pre-bookings again for the device beginning early

Saturday morning.



"All the four stores are completely sold out except for pre-booked customers who

came and collected them," said Nadeem Khanzadah, head of retail at Jumbo

Electronics.



He said that Jumbo is assured of getting good quantities in the next consignment

but he does not know how many.



He said the iPhone 6 Plus was limited compared to iPhone 6 and the demand for

iPhone 6 was more than 6 Plus. It may be due to the "bendgate" controversy.



Sean Connor, General Manager of Plug Ins, said that the iPhones vanished within

one hour of sale with many people queuing even after stocks went dry.



"We started pre-bookings again but did not guarantee when the stocks will be

available," he said.



The official Apple Store in the UAE is to start taking orders for the new phones

from Saturday.



The new iPhones come in gold, silver and space grey. On Apple's website, the

iPhone 6 is available for Dh2,599 for the 16GB model, Dh2,999 for the 64GB model

and, for the first time, a new 128GB model for Dh3,399. The prices on Apple's

website for the iPhone 6 Plus are Dh2,999 for the 16GB model, Dh3,399 for the

64GB model and Dh3,799 for the new 128GB model.
