Apple will finally unveil the iPhone 6 on the 9th September.

The firm has booked in a media event for next month, and Re/code reckons it's to
announce the next generation iPhone.

With a new iPhone being launched every year since 2006, the devices are
traditionally launched in September, so the reports seem likely to be true.

The iPhone 6 is expected to come in two different flavours, one with a 4.7-inch
screen, and another with a larger 5.5-inch screen. The smaller device is expcted
to be released first. This would follow on from last September when Apple
launched both the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. Re/code did not cite any sources,
and Apple has not yet responded to emails seeking comment.

Analysts expect the larger of the two iPhone 6 models to go head to head with
larger-screened competitors such as Samsung's phablets.

Apple is reportedly in talks with several major credit card companies regarding
implementing mobile payment technology into the iPhone 6.

A successful deal would see iPhone users able to pay for goods both online and
in-store using the mobile device instead of cash, and could also extend to
managing tools such as loyalty cards and vouchers.

Apple could also introduce near-field communication (NFC) technology into new
devices, which allow so-called 'tap and pay" contactless services similar to
those used by the likes of Barclaycard and Mastercard. Alternatively, its
digital wallet could use existing Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections to facilitate
the payments.

Last month, Foxconn, the Taiwanese iPhone manufacturer, has announced it is
hiring 100,000 new workers to begin production of the iPhone 6.
