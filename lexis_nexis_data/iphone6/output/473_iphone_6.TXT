HIGHLIGHT:Â Next generation Apple flagship release imminent.





Apple will finally unveil the iPhone 6 on the 9th September.



The firm has booked in a media event for next month, and Re/code reckons it's to

announce the next generation iPhone.



With a new iPhone being launched every year since 2006, the devices are

traditionally launched in September, so the reports seem likely to be true.



The iPhone 6 is expected to come in two different flavours, one with a 4.7-inch

screen, and another with a larger 5.5-inch screen. The smaller device is expcted

to be released first. This would follow on from last September when Apple

launched both the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. Re/code did not cite any sources,

and Apple has not yet responded to emails seeking comment.



Analysts expect the larger of the two iPhone 6 models to go head to head with

larger-screened competitors such as Samsung's phablets.



Apple is reportedly in talks with several major credit card companies regarding

implementing mobile payment technology into the iPhone 6.



A successful deal would see iPhone users able to pay for goods both online and

in-store using the mobile device instead of cash, and could also extend to

managing tools such as loyalty cards and vouchers.



Apple could also introduce near-field communication (NFC) technology into new

devices, which allow so-called 'tap and pay" contactless services similar to

those used by the likes of Barclaycard and Mastercard. Alternatively, its

digital wallet could use existing Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections to facilitate

the payments.



Last month, Foxconn, the Taiwanese iPhone manufacturer, has announced it is

hiring 100,000 new workers to begin production of the iPhone 6.
