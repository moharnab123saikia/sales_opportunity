Apple's new larger-screen iPhones topped 4 million in pre-orders in the first 24

hours, surpassing earlier releases as demand for the smartphones outstrips

supply.



Deliveries of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will start at the end of this week,

when the smartphones officially go on sale, and a backlog will mean that many

won't receive their handsets until next month, the Cupertino, California-based

company said in a statement yesterday.



Apple said there will be devices in stock in stores on September 19 and

encouraged customers to arrive early or order online for in-store pick-up.



Chief executive officer Tim Cook is counting on the bigger phones to counter

Samsung Electronics's larger displays and to usher in demand for other products

Apple introduced last week, from the Apple Watch to the credit card-substituting

Apple Pay service. The company had indicated that the new smartphones would take

as many as four weeks to ship.



The iPhone 6 has a 11.9-centimetre display and the iPhone 6 Plus has a

13.9-centimetre one, while the previous iPhones have a 10.1-centimetre screen.



"It speaks to the pent-up demand for a larger iPhone," Tim Bajarin, an analyst

at Creative Strategies, said in a telephone interview. "Apple will actually have

record quarters for the minimum of the next two years just because of this kind

of demand."



The pre-orders are double the 2 million Apple announced in 2012 when it released

the iPhone 5, and compares with the 9 million the company sold during the

opening weekend last year for the iPhone 5s and 5c.



"We are thrilled customers love them as much as we do," Cook said in the

statement.



The iPhone remains the most important piece of Apple's business. The handset

accounted for about half of Apple's $171 billion (Bt5.5 trillion) in revenue

last fiscal year. With sales of the iPad slowing down, the company needs to keep

the iPhone a blockbuster in order to maintain growth.



The iPhone 6 costs $199 to $399 with a two-year contract, while the 6 Plus is

priced at $299 to $499. The devices will come in silver, gold and space grey.



61 Million



Demand for the handsets has Apple poised to sell more than 61 million iPhones in

the December quarter, surpassing last year_s record 51 million sold, Barclays

Plc said in a note today.



_We believe significant demand will even spill into the March and June quarters

given supply and the timing of shipments in China,_ Ben Reitzes, an analyst at

Barclays, wrote in the note.



This isn_t the first time Apple and phone carriers have seen iPhone models

delayed well before they were available in stores. In 2012, the iPhone 5 was

delayed for shipment by a week after a rush of orders, and in 2011 the iPhone 4S

sold out at AT&T Inc., Verizon Wireless, and Sprint Nextel Corp. only five days

after pre-orders began.



The new devices will go on sale first in the US, Australia, Canada, France,

Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK On September 26, 20

additional countries will begin selling the handsets.



China, one of Apple_s biggest markets, won_t get the new devices at first,

though the company said it plans to have the handsets in 115 countries by the

end of the year.
