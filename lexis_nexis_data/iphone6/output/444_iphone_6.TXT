- Apple CEO Tim Cook debuted Apple's first new product category Tuesday since

the introduction of the iPad tablet computer, showing off a new smartwatch along

with two new        iPhones and a mobile- payments offering built into the new

devices.



The wearable computer, called simply the Apple Watch, has a new user interface,

with Cook declaring, What we didn't do was take the iPhone and shrink the user

interface and strap it on your wrist.



It will come in three different basic forms: Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and

Apple Edition, with the last one available in 18-karat gold. Apple Watch will be

a standard offering, while the Sport edition will be sturdier. The wrist

computer will be highly customizable, with different sizes for the watch face

and bands of different colors as well as leather and metal, with a starting base

price of $350. The device will go



on sale in early 2015.



Users will interact with the Apple Watch through a dial on the side, using it to

scroll up and down and zoom in, or through its touchscreen, which is made of

synthetic sapphire. The device will have Apple's voice-detection technology

Siri, allowing users to guide through interactions with voice commands, and a

series of gestures can help control basic functions as well.



The watch, which must be used in tandem with an iPhone 5 or later, can record

users' vitals, with sensors detecting bodily actions such as pulse rate, and

record them with HealthKit, Apple software introduced earlier this year at the

Worldwide Developers Conference.



With its customizable form and different possible tasks, the Apple Watch can be

a different device for different users' needs, Cook said.



I use mine to control the Apple TV, another team member uses his as a remote for

his iPhone camera, the CEO said.



Apple introduced two new iPhones that will function with its watch: a larger

iPhone than before, the iPhone 6 Plus, along with the iPhone 6, which Cook

described as the best phones you have ever seen.



The iPhone 6 Plus will be 5.5 inches diagonal, a size in between a smartphone

and tablet that has proved especially popular in Asia.



One of the iPhone 6's advances is Apple Pay, a mobile-payments offering that

utilizes near-field communications to get rid of credit cards' outdated and

vulnerable magnetic stripe, as Cook described them. Instead of using physical

cards, the iPhone will connect to users' payment options, while not storing

credit card numbers or security codes.



The service will work with 220,000 contactless machines in place at retailers,

along with Apple partners such as McDonald's, Walgreens and Disney.



Apple will begin selling the phones on Sept. 19 in the United States.



The two new iPhones will arrive with Apple's newest mobile operating system, iOS

8.
