Apple is chipping away at Samsung's dominant position in its home turf of South

Korea - thanks to its new iPhone 6 series.



Apple captured a record 33 percent market share in South Korea in November, the

highest ever for a foreign brand, according to a monthly report released by Hong

Kong-based market research company Counterpoint on Wednesday. In contrast,

Samsung's share slipped to 46 percent after hovering around 60 percent for five

months.



Apple's gains in South Korea are telling, as November was the first full month

that the larger-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were sold in the country. The sales

likely came at the expense of Samsung's flagship Galaxy Note 4 phablet launched

in late September.



"iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have made a difference here, denting the competition's

phablet sales," Counterpoint analyst Tom Kang said. "If there was a better

supply of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus 64 GB and 128 GB models, then Apple's share could

have climbed to the 40 percent level." Analysts in South Korea generally expect

Samsung to have lost further share of the global market in October-December for

the fourth consecutive quarter as Apple extended its lead in the premium segment

and upstarts like China's Xiaomi Inc made huge inroads into the low-end market.
