6 fresh Apple iPhone 6, iOS 7 concept designs;

Touch anywhere, curved format among ideas from would-be Apple smartphone

designers

Patent filings by Apple itself showing the concept of a wrap-around screen

consuming the entire iPhone have fueled somedesign concepts. One comes from

Nickolay Lamm and Matteo Gianni, who put forth this curved-exterior iPhone 6

concept that some have speculated would be less susceptible to cracks if real.



[IPHONEYS: The iOS 7 edition] Another design from Lamm, on behalf of

MyVoucherCodes, envisions a plastic, possibly translucent, budget iPhone. Rumors

have persisted that Apple will roll out cheaper iPhones, particularly to appeal

to people in poorer countries, though Apple executives such as Senior Vice

President of Marketing Phil Schiller have pooh-poohed such talk.Â  One theme

running through the new concept designs is ever more streamlined touchscreen

capabilities.



Federico Bianco envisions -- in a nearly 4-minute video -- what iOS 7 could mean

for the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPad 5, including the ability to tap into apps

and controls (such as quick replies and airplane mode) from the lock screen.

Bianco shows a way to double tap on widgets, such as the music player, to

provide quicker access to them. He also displays a way to reset widget controls,

such as volume, in a more streamlined manner.



[IPHONEYS: The iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S edition] Separately, this Arthur Reis

concept design includes a "touch anywhere" home button on the iPhone 6 that

works across the bottom of this thinner-than-current Apple smartphone. Reis also

works in a 12mp iSight camera.



While designers foresee more sensitive touch capabilities, Yanko Design

emphasizes sturdiness in its latest concept design, noting: "One of the reasons

why many people buy a fender for their iPhone is that the back surface tends to

scratch pretty easily, especially in the iPhone 5. Designer Matt Hughson

envisions the iPhone 6 to come designed with an integrated aluminum outer frame,

which creates a protective lip for the front & back of the phone. This provides

improved protection for your screen & camera."



Finally, this mysterious iPhone X, from Bob Freking, boasts a 1.8GHz quad-core

AX CPU, 4GB of RAM and 16mp iSight camera.



Freking goes with a 4.8-inch screen, wireless charging and NFC support. And

whoa! A $1,200 price tag!

well on Twitter and Google +.
