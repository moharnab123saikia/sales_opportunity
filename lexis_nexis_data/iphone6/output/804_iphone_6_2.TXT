IN JUST 30 minutes, finance manager Sky Hui made a cool profit of $4,000 from

buying and re-selling three new iPhones.



As iPhone 6 frenzy hit Singapore and elsewhere over the weekend, some people

have been looking for ways to make a quick buck by flipping Apple's latest smart

devices - the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.



It is not hard to find someone willing to pay extra cash for your phone, if you

browse forums like HardwareZone, or visit handphone shop websites like Mobile

Square and Sg Mobile.



Mr Hui, 30, had pre-booked three 128GB iPhone 6 Plus devices with SingTel. He

then contacted 40 buyers he found on HardwareZone and met one at Raffles City,

about 30 minutes after collecting his phones from SingTel's launch event at

Marina Bay Sands last Friday.



He had renewed three contracts for himself and his parents to pay $746 for each

phone. He then sold them at $2,200 each to the buyer, making a total profit of

$4,362. The iPhone 6 Plus costs $1,448 without a contract.



"The buyer was a 22-year-old guy. I passed him the phones and he took out a

bundle of $1,000 notes, counted six and passed them to me. That was shocking!"

said Mr Hui.



With the extra cash, he bought a 128GB iPhone 6 for $1,288, for his own use. He

had pre-booked it at an Apple retail store.



Those late to the game ended up making less.



Yesterday, there were also more active sellers than buyers on HardwareZone's

mobile phone bazaar forum.



Legal practitioner Kelvin Ho, 36, sold his new 16GB iPhone 6 at Mobile Square

for $1,030 yesterday. If he had done it last Friday, he could have got $1,200,

according to Sg Mobile's website.



Two shops that buy and re-sell iPhones said demand for Apple's latest smart

devices this time has been lower than in previous years.



WhyMobile's retail sales manager Samuel Chan said: "There are more people

selling, but fewer buying. Last year we had people from China coming to buy 50

sets at one go, but none this year."



However, retail stores here had queues of tourists waiting to buy the phones.

Apple yesterday said global sales of its newest iPhones came to more than 10

million during the launch weekend. Singapore was one of nine markets to get the

phones first.



Both versions are sold out at EpiCentre's nine outlets and Nubox's 13 outlets.



A 35-year-old housewife, who declined to give her name, bought four phones at

WhyMobile in Far East Plaza yesterday.



She said her husband had queued overnight but went home empty handed. So she

decided to "just pay more" to get the phones for herself and her family. She

paid $1,550 for each 128GB iPhone 6, which costs $1,288.



"I cannot wait anymore, that's why I came here. We've compared prices and the

price here is the best," she said.
