HIGHLIGHT:Â SIM- free models expected to cost between $649 and $949.





Apple is planning to sell SIM-free versions of its latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

Plus models across the US, via the company's physical retail stores and online

store.



Presently, the phones are available only through contract, with the unlocked

version available on T-Mobile which works using different carriers. However,

users in the US cannot technically buy the latest phones SIM-free through

official channels in the country.



With the latest move, users will be able to buy iPhone 6 and 6 Plus without a

SIM-card which will enable them to use their phones all around the world using a

carrier of their choice, reported 9 to 5 Mac.



The price for SIM-free iPhones is expected to the same as that of T-Mobile

variants which ranges between $649 and $949 depending upon the screen size and

storage capacity.



Apple has already introduced SIM- free version of iPhones in other countries,

and in 2012 and 2013 the company sold unlocked version of iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S

two months after its initial launch.
