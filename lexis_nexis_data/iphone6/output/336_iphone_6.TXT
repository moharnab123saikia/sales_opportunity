Chinese largest carriers China Mobile Communications Corporation, China Unicom
and China Telecom all have removed the web pages for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus
pre-order service, which was launched earlier this month.

Both China Unicom and China Mobile offered some information on Apple Inc's
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on their pre-order web pages, including the price and
two different display sizes before the launch of the phones.

China Mobile received 30,000 orders in just two hours after unveiling the
pre-order pages, China Economic Net reported Tuesday.

An insider at China's online shopping mall JD.com Inc told cnr.cn on Tuesday
that the company would explore new promotion methods through the cooperation
with finance industry or other business sectors.

Song Yang, vice-president of Paipai.com, an e-commerce platform owned by JD.com,
also said on Tuesday that they had already prepared a specific section for
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales on its website. The sales webpage has been
launched Wednesday.

Analyst Wang Jun from Analysys International said that for high-end cell phones,
there is not much difference between iOS and Android operation systems when it
comes to specifications, operation, market share and application.
