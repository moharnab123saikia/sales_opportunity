According to the Apple Turkey website, an iPhone 6 with 16 gigabytes of memory

now costs TL 2,499 ($1,043). Its previous price was TL 2,349 ($1,000). The

biggest increase appears to be in the price of the Apple MacBook Pro: The price

for a 13-inch, Retina display MacBook Pro is now TL 3,799 ($1,618), up from TL

3,499 ($1,490).



The new prices have been in effect since Jan. 1.



The Turkish lira hit record lows in mid-December, with its lowest point at 2.41

to the dollar, due to an emerging market sell-off and domestic political

tensions. One US dollar is currently trading at 2.35 against the lira.
