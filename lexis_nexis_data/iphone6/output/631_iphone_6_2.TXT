An Android iPhone 6 with 8MP selfie camera from Lenovo!

Lenovo has unveiled its rumored Sisley S90 Smartphone which has a striking

resemblance to the Iphone 6. This is not the first time that a handset maker

copied the design language of iPhone, as we have seen many local players taking

a cue from Apple iPhone's design. The Iphone 6 lookalike Sisley however is

making news because it comes from a top tier Smartphone player, which was least

expected.



The Lenovo's baby brings almost similar chassis with the curved edge design that

has white antenna lines, and thinness to that of Apple's flagship iPhone 6.



The Lenovo S90 Sisley is a 5-inch phone with a Super AMOLED 720p screen and

measures 6.9mm thin. It is powered by Snapdragon 410 quad-core processor with

1GB of RAM, a 13-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, and

the Android 4.4.4 KitKat.



The phone has been launched in China for RMB 1,999 which translates to INR

20,100 approximately.



Obviously, Lenovo Sisley S90's such a striking resemblance to the iPhone 6 is

intentional. With such alikness to the iPhone 6, Lenovo has clearly tried to rip

off Apple with its Sisley S90 smartphone. In fact, even the poster and graphics

of the Sisley look inspired from that of the Apple iPhone 6. The move surprises

all because this was not expected from a company like Lenovo which is a well

established brand in itself.
