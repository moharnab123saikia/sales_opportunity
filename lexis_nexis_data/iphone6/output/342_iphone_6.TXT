

Although China's largest carriers have been ready to roll out iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6 Plus, the cell phones are now reportedly waiting for China's network
access license from the stry of Industry and Information Technology.

The ministry usually distributes licenses twice a month. But as the new iPhone
had missed the deadline earlier this month, another chance might come near the
end of this month, China Business News reported Thursday.

Chinese largest carriers China Mobile Communications Corporation, China Unicom
and  all have removed the web pages for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus pre-order
service, which was launched earlier this month.

By Wednesday, China Mobile had received 72,000 pre-orders, China Unicom 15,000
and China Telecom 18,000.

Besides the three carriers, other retailers in China are also ready for iPhone 6
and iPhone 6 Plus sales.

On Wednesday, Chinese large  sites Taobao.com and Paipai.com launched special
sections to accept iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus pre-orders.
