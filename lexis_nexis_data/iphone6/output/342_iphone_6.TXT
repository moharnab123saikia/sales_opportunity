Although China's largest carriers have been ready to roll out iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus, the cell phones are now reportedly waiting for China's network

access license from the stry of Industry and Information Technology.



The ministry usually distributes licenses twice a month. But as the new iPhone

had missed the deadline earlier this month, another chance might come near the

end of this month, China Business News reported Thursday.



Chinese largest carriers China Mobile Communications Corporation, China Unicom

and  all have removed the web pages for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus pre-order

service, which was launched earlier this month.



By Wednesday, China Mobile had received 72,000 pre-orders, China Unicom 15,000

and China Telecom 18,000.



Besides the three carriers, other retailers in China are also ready for iPhone 6

and iPhone 6 Plus sales.



On Wednesday, Chinese large  sites Taobao.com and Paipai.com launched special

sections to accept iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus pre-orders.
