market faster than Nigeria. The news of a new mobile phone is received with
exhilaration which eventually spark off acquisition competition.

Nigerians buy phones for fun. While many enjoy the features and functionalities
of latest innovations, others buy for fashion and style, or even status symbol.

Device makers may have noticed this and apparently tilt prices depending on the
level of 'craze' users in different regions show towards the devices.

When the news filtered in that the just released Apple iPhone 6 was in the
making, many Nigerians had already started saving for it. This was irrespective
of having almost all the different series of the iPhone smartphone in their
possessions. Nobody wants to be with the outdated!

Incidentally, Nigerians were not the only iPhone users anticipating the release
of the device or showing 'craze' for it. Across Europe, Asia, Africa and even
the Americas, the iPhone frenzy was rife.

And boom! Last week, Apple not only released the much awaited iPhone 6, but
added a plus specification, the iphone6+. The devices are larger than the
regular iphone. They are also embedded with near field communications, NFC,
which Apple says offer a more secure and fingerprint-based way to pay for goods
and services.

Apple's claim of superior security features with the NFC threatens the credit
and debit cards and may render them redundant, if proven worthwhile.

According to Apple, with the NFC, users will be able to hold their phone on a
standard credit card reader, and the payment will be processed only when a
fingerprint is used to verify their identity. The company claims that, for the
first time, vendors will not see any details about the customer, such as their
name, address or credit card number.

However, a peep into Apple's online shop in US, lists the iPhone 6 at between
$199 and $399 and the Plus at $299-499. Of course those are carrier subsidised
prices, anyway.

But a close look reveals a fairly significant price differentiation in a number
of markets.

Apple's online store in Hong Kong only lists "prices starting at", presumably
for the 16GB versions. But both the 6 and 6 Plus - at HKD5,588 ($720) and
HKD6,388 ($825) - are $90-107 cheaper than in Australia, $70-95 lower than in
Singapore and $30-40 less than in Taiwan.

The iPhone 6 128GB version in Taiwan is $100 less than in Australia and $80 less
than Singapore. For the 16GB model, the difference narrows to $60-40. For the
top 6 Plus handset, which is going for at least $1,100 in the three markets,
prices in Australia and Singapore are almost the same but still about $60 more
than Taiwan. On the 16GB 6 Plus, the gap narrows to $65-55.

The Sydney Morning Herald lists the 6 at AUD869-1,129 ($810-1,050) and the 6
Plus goes for AUD999-1,249. Three memory options are offered: 16GB, 64GB and
128GB for the first time.

In Taiwan the Taipei Times reports the iPhone will be priced at TWD22,500-29,500
($750-950) while the 6 Plus will go for between TWD25,900 and TWD32,900.

The Straits Times in Singapore compiled a fantastic graphic comparing the 6 and
6 Plus and Apple Watch to four or five competitive offerings. Another page lists
prices at SGD988-1,288 ($790-1,030) for the 6 and SGD1,288-1,448 for the 6 Plus.

These are just a few tips to the price variations that users' craze for newer
versions of strong mobile brands can bring about.

Right now, pricing has not been released in Nigeria, where Apple has one of its
strongest authorised resellers, Core Group Africa. But the truth is that
Nigerian iPhone lovers wishing to have this new beaut, may just prepare to cough
out between N120,000 to 200,000 or even much more.
