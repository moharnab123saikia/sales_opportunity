Apple's new devices -iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus -are expected to corner a chunk

of the premium market when they are introduced in India on the back of pent up

aspirational demand.The Cupertino-based company's new gadgets could beat back

competition from upcoming launches by leading brands such as Samsung, Sony and

BlackBerry in this low-volume, high-value category of smartphones, say analysts.



The brand's iconic status -besides features such as a larger, crisper screen,

faster processor, better camera and onboard storage of as much as 128 GB -will

continue to draw consumers, analysts add.



"Success of upcoming flagship devices such as iPhone 6 series, BlackBerry and

Xperia Z3 will be quite polarised towards iPhones as the rich urban consumer

will look to get her hands on the most aspirational brand in the market right

now, which is Apple," said Tarun Pathak, a senior research analyst at Hong

Kong-based Counterpoint Research.



Of the two, the iPhone 6 Plus with a 5.5-inch display could fare better, given

the demand for handsets with larger screen sizes, analysts said.



While there is uncertainty over whether Apple will start selling the new iPhones

in India before or after Diwali, Samsung is set to launch its Note 4 phablet

before the festival of lights. Although the India prices for the iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus have not been officially disclosed, they are available in Delhi's

grey market for between .



`1,00,000 and .



`2,00,000, three to four times the expected price, and an indication of the huge

interest in the products. The unlocked, 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus costs $949 (about .



`58,600) in the US, according to Apple's website.



However, launch delays and supply issues given the huge global demand and

"exorbitant pricing" could affect demand for the new iPhones for at least the

next two or three months, Pathak cautioned,



indicating that if Apple missed the upcoming festival season, competitors such

as Samsung and Sony could steal a march over it in the near term. Apple sold

over 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models in the three days after the

launch on September 19.



Sony started sales of flagship products Xperia Z3 and Xperia Z3 Compact last

week at .



`51,990 and .



`44,990, respectively, while BlackBerry launched its Passport smartphone on

Monday for .



`49,990. Samsung introduced the Galaxy ALPHA smartphone for .



`39,990 last week.



The new and upcoming launches, which showcase technological advancements and

innovations, could provide a fillip to growth in the premium segment of

smartphones, which start at .



`35,000. Sony has improved its display, hardware and design over the Z2, while

Samsung brought a steel-bodied phone for the first time in the Galaxy Alpha.

BlackBerry's Passport offers a unique square display, which allows greater

reading space, apart from an innovative touch-enabled keyboard that combines a

physical keypad with virtual keypad functions.



According to Counterpoint Research, the market share of smartphones above .



`35,000 was limited to 2.5% in the first quarter till March and fell to 2.3% by

June.



The decline was mainly blamed on the lack of innovation, which wasn't appealing

enough for consumers to replace their already expensive handsets.
