iPhone 5 unveiling: has Apple rung the changes?

Excitement is building ahead of next week's expected iPhone 5 announcement. But

whether you rush out to buy the latest wondergadget or not, owners of earlier

iPhones and iPods will also benefit from the upgraded operating system. Claire

Rogers rounds up the rumours on Apple's latest phone.



--------------------



IFIGURES Apple doesn't typically disclose sales figures but in a recent patent

court case with Samsung it revealed it has sold 85 million iPhones in the United

States alone since the device was first launched in 2007.



Each new iPhone model typically sells more units than all of the previous

versions combined. Based on Apple's iPhones sales for the three months ended

December 2011 (which totalled 37.04m), there were more iPhones sold per day

(377,959) than people born in the world (estimates of the average birth rate

vary between about 360,000 and 372,000 births per day). Analyst firm Piper

Jaffray estimates Apple will sell between 26 million and 28 million iPhone 5s.

IPAD MINI



Gadget gossip also has it that Apple is working on an iPad Mini - with a

7.85-inch screen (the new iPad has a 9.7-inch display). Apple acolytes had

suggested this could be unveiled at the same time as the iPhone 5, but a later

launch - perhaps in October - for any such device now seems more likely.



Apple all but confirmed rumours of a September 12 US launch this week when it

invited media to an event on Wednesday (early Thursday NZ time). The invitation

teasingly has the date 12 casting a shadow in the shape of the number 5.



SIZE MATTERS



Apple's high-resolution "retina display" iPhone screens are a big drool-card for

gadget lovers - but size also matters. The larger the screen the easier it is to

read emails, view photos and watch video. Samsung's latest iPhone rival, the

Samsung Galaxy S III, sports a 4.8-inch high- definition display, leaving the

iPhone 4s - with a 3.5-inch screen - well behind in the size stakes.



iPhone 4S: 3.5 inches



Samsung Galaxy S III: 4.8 inches



iPhone 5: Likely to have a 4-inch screen



SO DOES SPEED



High-end smartphones with quad-core processors - theoretically more capable of

handling multitasking and applications such as gaming than dual-core processors

- have begun to emerge, which begs the question will Apple follow suit? whispers

are suggesting both yes and no, alternatively citing Apple's desire to keep up

with competitors and its previous strategy of not blindly following rivals to

the highest specs.



iPhone 4S: Apple A5 1GHz dual-core processor



Samsung Galaxy S III: 1.4GHZ Exynos quad-core processor



iPhone 5: Dual-core, dual core with extra graphics power, or quad-core?



SKIN DEEP



The iPhone will be revamped, experts predict, with a new design and leaked

pictures suggesting a two-tone brushed aluminium backing, a smaller dock,

relocated headphone jack (from the top of the handset to the bottom) and bigger

speaker grills.



ON THE SCALES



Rumours are the new iPhone has also slimmed down, with one report suggesting it

will measure 7.6 millimetres in thickness - making it one of the thinnest

smartphones around.



iPhone 4S: 9.3mm



Samsung Galaxy S III: 8.6mm



iPhone 5: rumoured to be 7.6mm.



SNAP SNAP



Don't expect dramatic change on the camera front - the rear-facing camera is

expected to remain the same at 8 megapixels, which is plenty. The front-facing

camera could get an upgrade to high- definition, though, to give a better

picture for video calling and is reportedly being moved to above the speaker.



iPhone 4S: 8MP rear camera, lower- resolution 0.3 MP front camera



Samsung Galaxy S III: 8MP rear camera, 1.9MP HD front camera



iPhone 5: 8MP rear camera, HD front camera



NFC CHIP



Technophiles have been poring over leaked photos of what is supposedly the new

iPhone, looking for signs it will have an NFC chip. NFC stands for "near field

communication", it's a technology that allows devices to communicate wirelessly

with others - so smartphones could be used like contactless swipe cards, for

example, to make payments.



iPhone 4S: no NFC



Samsung Galaxy S III: has NFC



iPhone 5: Remains to be seen.



FASTER BROADBAND



It's not so relevant for New Zealand yet, but the next iPhone is rumoured to

support 4G LTE - which means faster mobile broadband. This will be of little use

until our telcos have 4G mobile networks up and running. Telecom is trialing a

4G service later this year but 4G networks are probably a few years away.



iPhone 4S: no 4G LTE support



Samsung Galaxy S III: supports 4G LTE in some countries



iPhone 5: likely to support 4G in some countries



SOUPED-UP SOFTWARE



The new iPhone will come pre-loaded with iOS 6, the latest version of Apple's

mobile operating system. Even if you're not planning to get to the iPhone 5, if

you have an iPhone 3GS, 4 or 4S, a second or third generation iPad or a fourth

generation iPod Touch you'll be able to upgrade your software.



IOS 6 KEY FEATURES INCLUDE:



Bye bye Google Maps. Apple is introducing its own mapping app and showing

Google's the door as the two continue to fight for mobile device dominance.



Apple's voice recognition technology Siri - previously only available for the

iPhone 4S - will debut on the iPad (the newest version only, sorry folks) with

the launch of iOS 6. You'll also be able to use Siri to fire up applications and

movies.



Fob off unwanted phone calls with the new Do Not Disturb feature, which lets you

automatically send text messages telling callers you'll phone them back, or set

up a "call when you leave" reminder for when you leave your current location.



Apple says using Facebook on your mobile device will be even easier thanks to

iOS 6. You'll be able to post to the social networking site straight from a

variety of apps on your device.



The iOS 6 also marks the debut of Passbook - an app that aims to keep all your

tickets, coupons and vouchers in the one place. Local businesses will need to

get on board for this to be truly useful though.



The web browser Safari also gets an upgrade with iOS 6. While browsing you'll be

able to save your tabs on one Apple device and pick up where you left off on

another (through iCloud).
