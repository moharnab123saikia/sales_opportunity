iPhone 5s new price may not be effective till 'end of october'.



Thursday, September 18, 2014: Few days back there was a huge buzz created in the

market about the fall in iPhone 5s price in India. But the excitement couldn't

go for long after Apple India rolled back the price cut decision it made.



Last week, Apple distributors in India made a significant price cut announcement

in iPhone 5S 32GB which is presently priced at Rs 62,500, cutting it down to Rs

49,500. The reason behind taking back the decision is not yet known. Apple

distributor Redington reported in a communication with the dealers on Tuesday

that the Apple new iPhone 5s shipment with new MRP label has been delayed to the

end of October; new prices can only be availed after the stock from Apple is

received.



Earlier 26 September was decided as the launch date for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

Plus in India on Apple's website which was later changed to 17 October and then

after some time any detail about the launch date was removed from the website

assuming the reason to be shortage of stock availability. Few days back Apple

announced that it has launched sold 4 million units of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

Plus on the first day of pre-order with some models getting their delivery dates

in November.



The MRP of iPhone 5s 16GB was cut down to Rs. 44,500 as compared to 53,500

launch price. However 16GB iPhone 5s was seen available online for between Rs.

35,000 and Rs. 40,000 for quite sometime.
