something about it with the upcoming iPhone 6.

The 4.7-inch model of the Apple iPhone 6 could ship with a 2,100 mAh
(milliampere hour) capacity battery, rather than the 1,810 mAh battery
previously speculated for the handset, ESM-China analyst Sung Chang Xu said on
WeiboWalletHerohttp://wallethero.com/iphone-6-survey/[/URL] in May found that
longer battery life is the top feature desired in the iPhone 6. Respondents were
allowed to pick multiple choices when asked about their hopes for the next
iPhone. Longer battery life was the top choice, with 97% of respondents,
followed by larger screen (85%), better camera (73%) and faster processor (43%).

A survey of more than 4,000 consumers by RBC Capital Markets in June yielded
similar results. Asked about features that would make them buy the iPhone 6,
improved battery life was the clear No. 1 with 33%, followed by bigger screen
size (23%), faster processor (18%) and better camera (12%).
