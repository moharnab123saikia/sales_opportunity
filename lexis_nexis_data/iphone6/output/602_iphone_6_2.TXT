BYLINE: PATRICK SEITZ this week. She said her statement was based on

supply-chain sources. The current iPhone 5S has a 1,560 mAh battery. Given that

the new iPhone will have a bigger display and faster components than its

Apple has heard iPhone users' gripes about poor battery life and decided to do

something about it with the upcoming iPhone 6.



The 4.7-inch model of the Apple iPhone 6 could ship with a 2,100 mAh

(milliampere hour) capacity battery, rather than the 1,810 mAh battery

previously speculated for the handset, ESM-China analyst Sung Chang Xu said on

WeiboWalletHerohttp://wallethero.com/iphone-6-survey/[/URL] in May found that

longer battery life is the top feature desired in the iPhone 6. Respondents were

allowed to pick multiple choices when asked about their hopes for the next

iPhone. Longer battery life was the top choice, with 97% of respondents,

followed by larger screen (85%), better camera (73%) and faster processor (43%).



A survey of more than 4,000 consumers by RBC Capital Markets in June yielded

similar results. Asked about features that would make them buy the iPhone 6,

improved battery life was the clear No. 1 with 33%, followed by bigger screen

size (23%), faster processor (18%) and better camera (12%).
