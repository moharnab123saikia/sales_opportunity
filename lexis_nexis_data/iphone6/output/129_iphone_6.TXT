Oct. 2 -- US-based Pioneer Electronics Inc issued the following news release:



Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc today released the Apple CarPlay-compatible fourth

generation AppRadio 4 (SPH-DA120).



AppRadio 4 brings together the use of cloud and device sourced content from

compatible iOS devices (iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5,

iPhone 4s and iPhone 4), Android smartphones, and MirrorLink enabled

smartphones, as well as feature enhanced smartphone control, voice control for

Siri Eyes Free and Google Voice Recognition, Bluetooth hands-free calling and

audio streaming, and a new graphical user interface.



"The new AppRadio 4 embodies our idea of the connected car, providing the

majority of smartphone owners the ability to utilize their devices in the car

for calling, streaming music, and even controlling supported apps to enhance

their driving experience," said Ted Cardenas, vice president of marketing for

the Car Electronics Division of Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc.



CarPlay Ready - With CarPlay, consumers with iPhone 5 or later, including iPhone

6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and the latest version of iOS can use Siri voice control to

make and receive calls, compose and respond to text messages, use Apple Maps for

navigation and listen to their music libraries, podcasts and iTunes Radio. For

more information about CarPlay, visit: (www.apple.com/ios/carplay).



Siri Eyes Free - Users of iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone

5 and iPhone devices can take advantage of Siri Eyes Free functionality with a

touch of the AppRadio 4 touchscreen. When activated, Siri provides voice prompts

through the vehicle's speakers, and the user's questions and commands are

received and transmitted using the external microphone provided with the

AppRadio 4 unit.



Bluetooth - To maximize the connectivity options available in today's most

popular smartphones, AppRadio 4 offers both Bluetooth hands-free calling1 and

Bluetooth audio streaming and wireless control of compatible devices.



It includes Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) for wireless audio

streaming and Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) version 1.4 for

wireless control of devices and related metadata (if available) to be viewed

directly on the Pioneer touchscreen display.



Enhanced Touchscreen User Interface - Designed with the smartphone user in mind,

the AppRadio 4 touchscreen user interface (UI) provides easy access to the most

commonly used features such as apps, music and calling.



Built-in MirrorLink - MirrorLink technology enables consumers to connect

compatible smartphones to AppRadio 4 (or other compatible in-dash receiver) via

a USB cable to access certain music and map applications for a more convenient

and safer in-car experience.



Similar to AppRadio Mode, MirrorLink is integrated into AppRadio 4 and offers a

vehicle-specific interface and connectivity with MirrorLink certified devices

from smartphone manufacturers such as Samsung, Nokia and others.



AppRadio 4 offers a simple and clean cosmetic design utilizing minimal physical

buttons on the left side of the screen for quick access by drivers, with the

majority of functions and control accessible and operated through its high

resolution 6.2-inch WVGA capacitive touchscreen.



The capacitive touch panel is used for all functions including the app

interface, music control/playback, AM/FM radio, and Bluetooth functions. A total

of four connectivity cable options2, sold separately, enable connections to more

than 30 different smartphone devices available in the U.S. In addition, the unit

now offers the Android Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) for deeper access to files

and folders on Android devices.



For increased audio performance, AppRadio 4 inherits the capabilities of

Pioneer's NEX receiver models with three sets of high volt (4V) pre-outs,

13-band graphic equalizer, auto EQ, auto time alignment, dual rear USB, and HDMI

input, AM/FM tuner with RDS text information display (when available), and

MOSFET 50 Watts X 4 power.
