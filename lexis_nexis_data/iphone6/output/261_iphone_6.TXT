Apple sure is going for a curved iPhone 6, reveals leaked pictures of glass

covers

Leaked images of parts or any leaked information about the upcoming Apple iPhone

6 have been a source of information about the new yet-to-be-announced phone. The

latest leak that comes today reveals that the iPhone 6 will sport a curved

profile - that is it will sport a design that is curved and tapering at the

edges instead of a flat and plane rectangular body that was used in iPhone 5S,

5C and iPhone 5.



Sonny Dickson has shared pictures of display glass covers in both black and

white of the upcoming iPhone with a display size of 4.7 inch, with 9to5 Mac. The

display panel shows a thin bezel and a place for placing the fingerprint scanner

in the bottom part, a front camera on the top side.



This is however the 4.7 inch iPhone 6, not the 5.5 inch one. When placed beside

the iPhone 5S/5C that has a 4-inch display apart from the display size, we could

not see any other starking difference. Does this mean iPhone 6 will not be a

landmark phone in design?



Last month Sonny Dickson leaked the images of LCD display screen of the upcoming

iPhone 6 measuring 5.5 inches (14 cms).



We have seen multiple leaks of the iPhone 6 in the past and speculations around

its features. But the confusion around the display size of upcoming phone has

not been answered in any leaks. This leak today seems to indicate that we are

going to get two iPhones of 4.7 inch and 5.5 display this year, as revealed by

Techradar (via Nikkei Japan) in March this year.



We do know that iPhone 6 will use thinner battery, A8 processor, a prepped up

camera with new features, more than a dozen of sensors and the all new iOS 8

operating  system. This new operating system revealed by Apple this year at the

WorldWide Developers Conference sports some new interesting features.



The new iPhone/iPhones could be launched in September/October this year.
