NEW DELHI: Unveiling its much awaited new smartphones, the iPhone 6s and iPhone

6s Plus, Apple on Wednesday claimed that latest iterations of its iPhones was

the best yet.



"The only thing that has changed with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus is everything

- 3D Touch lets users interact with iPhone in entirely new and fun ways, and the

innovative Live Photos brings your pictures to life," said Philip Schiller,

Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.



"These are the most advanced iPhones ever, with 7000 series aluminium,

ion-strengthened glass, the new 64-bit A9 chip, 12-megapixel iSight and

5-megapixel FaceTime HD cameras, faster Touch ID, LTE and Wi-Fi," he added.



We take a look at six things that you would like to know about the iPhone 6s and

the iPhone 6s Plus:



1) 3D Touch: Apple claims that the 3D Touch senses force to enable intuitive new

ways to access features and interact with content. "iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus

introduce new ways to navigate and experience iPhone by sensing pressure to

enable new gestures - Peek and Pop - so you can dip in and out of content

without losing your place," explains Apple.



"Press lightly to Peek at a photo, email, web page or other content, and press a

little deeper to Pop into the content itself. With Quick Actions, 3D Touch

provides shortcuts to the things you do most, so you can send a message or take

a selfie with just a simple press from the Home screen," Apple's release adds.



2) Hardware: Apple's new iPhones are powered by the A9 chip. "A9, Apple's

third-generation 64-bit chip powers the iPhones with 70 percent faster CPU and

90 percent faster GPU performance than the A8," says Apple.



3) New cameras: Additional camera advancements include a new 12-megapixel rear

camera. There is also a new 5-megapixel FaceTime HD camera and Retina Flash.



4) New camera features: iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus boast of 'Live Photos',

which Apple claims go beyond snapshots to capture moments in motion.

"High-definition video improves with support for 4K - with a resolution of 3840

x 2160, delivering over 8 million pixels - and the expansion of optical image

stabilization to video on iPhone 6s Plus. After capturing 4K video, you can edit

on your Mac, PC, iPad and with the latest version of iMovie on iPhone, you can

even edit two simultaneous streams," adds Apple.



5) Other enhancements: iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus boast of a faster Wi-Fi and

LTE Advanced. The new iPhones also support up to 23 LTE bands. The iPhones also

have a redesigned Notes app, detailed transit information in Maps, and an

all-new News app.



6) Price & Availability: iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus will be available in gold,

silver, space gray and the new rose gold metallic finishes. iPhone 6s has been
