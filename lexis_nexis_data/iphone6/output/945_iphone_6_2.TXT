Oh look, more iPhone 6 leaks! This time its from G for Games, who have
discovered some interesting images from a Chinese social-hub called Weibo.

The images are a bit sketchy - they are pictures of pictures taken off a
computer screen - but the report claims the actual shots came directly from a
Foxconn manufacturing plant which makes the iPhone 6.

The pictures are in-line with prior rumors of the iPhone 6, which shows the
device's thin bezel and the new aluminum back-plate. Interestingly, the camera
appears to protrude from the back, much like the camera module found in the
sixth-gen iPod Touch.

Apple is expected to release the iPhone 6 sometime in September.
