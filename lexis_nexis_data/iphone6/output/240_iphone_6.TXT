KOLKATA: Apple's new flagship iPhone 6 is facing a stock-out in India with the

US firm diverting supplies to select markets such as China, where there's an

unprecedented demand, and to build up stocks for Black Friday shopping on

November 28.



As a result, several large retailers and Apple exclusive stores have stopped

booking of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus."With Apple's distributors failing to

commit on supplies after the launch, we have stopped advance booking to avoid

any confrontation with customer," head of a big electronics retail chain said on

condition of anonymity.



Three senior executives of Apple's trade partners in India said iPhone 6

supplies have become erratic in last two weeks with only an estimated 15,000

units coming in phases. During the midnight launch on October 17, Apple had

shipped around 55,000 units of the new iPhones to India. Supplies of 64 GB

variant of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus - which is the most in demand - is the least, the

executives said.



According to industry sources, Apple India management has reportedly warned the

Cupertino, California headquarters that if supplies do not regularise, it may

become an uphill task to beat last year's record sales of two lakh units of the

then new iPhone 5s and 5c during the October-December quarter.



An email sent to Apple did not elicit any response till Thursday press time.



Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at market research firm Counterpoint Research, said

supply issues, exorbitant pricing and lack of EMI offers on iPhone 6 series will

cap the demand for the new Apple flagship at least next two or three

months."Till that time we expect a steady growth in iPhone 5s due to recent

price cuts," he said.



Apple cut prices of older iPhone models two weeks ago. The iPhone 5s 16GB is now

sold at Rs 42,999 while 5c 16GB model is priced Rs 34,000. The 5c 8GB is

available for Rs 29,000 and iPhone 4s 8GB for Rs 21,500.
