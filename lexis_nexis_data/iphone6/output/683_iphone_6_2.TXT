Time could be running short on iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 concept designs if

speculation is correct that Apple has a smartphonelaunch planned for Sept. 10.

But in the meantime, let the last of these great out-of-the box ideas roll.



[IPHONEYS SLIDESHOW: The iPhone 6 & iPhone 5S edition] One fresh take from NYC's

Claudio Guglieri at the Dribbble designers' site is a wraparound iPhone that

features a bezel-free display that literally wraps around the whole phone, even

the sides. The technology to support this, and help a user avoid tapping this

and that on the sides of the phone, would indeed be challenging to perfect.



Others on Dribbble, such as Fabio Basile, have advanced the iPhone 6 Infinity

even further, as seen here.Â  Another Dribbble designer, Michael Shanks, also

offered up his spin, including a lock screen on the front and icons on the side.



If you're looking for a better and BIGGER iPhone, here's Rav Avni's iPhablet

design. This concept boasts at 6.2-inch full HD display, fingerprint sensor, iOS

7.1, a 10MPand 3.2MP cameras, a choice of eight colors, an A8X chip and more.

What we have here is a tweener that fits in between an iPhone and iPad Mini

size-wise.
