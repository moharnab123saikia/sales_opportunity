Apple iPhone 6 to take longer to land in India, might miss the Diwali sale

season



LENGTH: 201  words





It might come as a disappointment to those awaiting the launch of the Apple

Iphone 6 and the Iphone 6 Plus in India, that Apple could have pushed the launch

date of its new generation iPhone to November. Apple first flashed September 26

as the launch date of its new gen iPhones in India, however soon postponed it to

October 17, which was the Friday before Diwali. A few days later, the company

pulled even that information from its website, which left us speculating the

date of launch of the new iPhones.



Now, Indian Express is reporting that the company might even miss Diwali launch

of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and further push the launch to mid November in

India.



Apple has already received record-breaking pre-orders for its new iPhones, and

due to the excessive demand has stretched the delivery period of these

pre-orders till October. In such a case, it could be difficult for the company

to set a time frame for the launch of its new iPhones in India. Currently, there

is no information on the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus launch date on its

India website.



The report also adds that these iPhones could be launched at price ranging from

INR 55,000 to INR 60,000, though nothing is confirmed as yet.
