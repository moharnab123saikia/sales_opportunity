handsets, according to the Chinese live tracking website JD.com, reports Cult of
Mac. Though figures of the new iPhone bookings in India are yet to arrive, the
handsets  are sure to make it big in India this year.

Amidst this news DigiTimes (via industry sources) report that the Cupertino
giant has asked chipset suppliers to increase the production of chips for Apple
devices, to churn out up to 200-250 million units of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus
and Watch.

The report says "Deducting some 30-40 million units of chips for the Apple
Watch, shipments of related chips will be enough for production of over 200
million units of iPhone 6 devices, meeting Apple's goal of shipping the same
amount of iPhone 6 and iPhone6 Plus, said the sources, noting that Apple is
likely to reach the goal much earlier than expected."
