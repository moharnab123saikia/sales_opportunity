

Apple launched its flagship Iphone 6 and 6 Plus yesterday in a jam-packed event.
The Cupertino based company tis time not only got a very different and easy
design for its phone body, it also prepped up the size of the phone display.

But Ron Amadeo the reviewer at ArsTechnica was not happy with the new Apple
phone. He was quick to point out "I couldn't help myself, sorry", because the
new Iphone 6 is like the Nexus 4 launched in 2012.

In June this year with the launch of iOS 8 at the WWDC Ron wrote a detailed
report about iOS 8 features that are inspired by Android.

Telegraph also correctly pointed out the features (software features) that Apple
is bring to the iPhone 6 Plus should have been on the iPhone 4 or 5 "to stop the
Android tide in its tracks."

It will be interesting to see how iPhone 6 stacks up against the Nexus 7 from
Google powered by stock Android OS. Here is a quick comparison of the two
phones.
