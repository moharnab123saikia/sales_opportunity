On specs front Apple iPhone 6 looks like the Android Google Nexus 4



LENGTH: 488  words





Apple launched its flagship Iphone 6 and 6 Plus yesterday in a jam-packed event.

The Cupertino based company tis time not only got a very different and easy

design for its phone body, it also prepped up the size of the phone display.



But Ron Amadeo the reviewer at ArsTechnica was not happy with the new Apple

phone. He was quick to point out "I couldn't help myself, sorry", because the

new Iphone 6 is like the Nexus 4 launched in 2012.



In June this year with the launch of iOS 8 at the WWDC Ron wrote a detailed

report about iOS 8 features that are inspired by Android.



Telegraph also correctly pointed out the features (software features) that Apple

is bring to the iPhone 6 Plus should have been on the iPhone 4 or 5 "to stop the

Android tide in its tracks."



It will be interesting to see how iPhone 6 stacks up against the Nexus 7 from

Google powered by stock Android OS. Here is a quick comparison of the two

phones.
