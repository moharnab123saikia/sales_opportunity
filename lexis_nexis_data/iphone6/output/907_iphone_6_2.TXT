Customers who buy Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus from Airtel Kenya's shops

Kenya chief executive Adil El Youssefi said.
The company is also offering data plans for customers who buy the phone. Those
buying iPhone 6 will get 3GB data a month for three months while iPhone 6 plus
buyers will get 4GB data a month for four months.

Airtel's deal is part of a growing trend that has seen insurance companies
strike partnerships with phone manufacturers and telcoms in order to get better
access to the growing smartphones market.
