Price ranges between Sh85,999 and Sh95,999 depending on the memory size. The

iPhone 6 plus, on the other hand, is retailing at Sh105,999.



Customers who buy Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus from Airtel Kenya's shops

will have the devices insured against theft or accidental damage for two years.

The insurance is in addition to the default one-year warranty from Apple, Airtel

Kenya chief executive Adil El Youssefi said.

The company is also offering data plans for customers who buy the phone. Those

buying iPhone 6 will get 3GB data a month for three months while iPhone 6 plus

buyers will get 4GB data a month for four months.

Price ranges between Sh85,999 and Sh95,999 depending on the memory size. The

iPhone 6 plus, on the other hand, is retailing at Sh105,999.

Airtel's deal is part of a growing trend that has seen insurance companies

strike partnerships with phone manufacturers and telcoms in order to get better

access to the growing smartphones market.
