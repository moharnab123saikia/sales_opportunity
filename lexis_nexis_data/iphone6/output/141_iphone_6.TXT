Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have finally arrived in Malta and are

exclusively available at all Vodafone retail outlets. Vodafone is the official

Apple representative in Malta.



"We are extremely excited to offer our customers even more choice in the shape

of the new iconic iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus," said Luan Vella, Terminals Senior

Executive. "With our high speed and reliable network and our great value plans,

Vodafone customers can be assured of a great experience at great value. We are

also particularly pleased that the arrival of the iPhone 6 coincides with

Vodafone's roll-out of 4G to our prepaid and contractual customers, so they can

get full benefit from the iPhone 6 experience thanks to the much faster download

speeds that 4G offers"



Vodafone is pleased to offer the best prices on the market, with the iPhone 6

costing [#x20ac]739, or just [#x20ac]149 with Vodafone RED premium plans for the

16GB model, and the iPhone 6 Plus priced at [#x20ac]849 or just [#x20ac]199 with

Vodafone RED premium plans for the 16GB model.



The iPhone 6 is available in grey, gold and silver. It has a 4.7 inch display

that is the largest ever on offer and also features brilliant colour and higher

contrast at even wider viewing angles with its 1334 x 750 resolution. It runs on

iOS 8, the world's most advanced mobile operating system, and includes the all

new A8 chip that can sustain higher performance than the previous A7 chip. This

allows giving customers the luxury of playing graphics-intensive games and

enjoying video at higher frame rates for longer than ever.



The iPhone 6 Plus also comes in grey, gold and silver  and features a 5.5 inch,

1920 x 1080 resolution screen. It operates on an A8 64-bit ARM with M8 motion

coprocessor, which is a remarkably small and efficient chip which is able to

deliver incredible performance with up to 50 per cent more energy efficient than

the A7 chip. Another feature is Metal, a new technology that lets developers

create highly immersive console-style games on iPhone and which is optimised to

allow the CPU and GPU to work together to deliver detailed graphics and complex

visual effects.
