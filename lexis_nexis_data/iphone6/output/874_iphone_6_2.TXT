It's that time of year again, the time when Apple computers gathers members of

the media to show off it's latest and newest line of products for the coming

year.



This year, the event will be held on September 9 in the Fresco Arts Center in

Cupertino California, right where Apple is situated. This also marks a return to

the location where Apple co-founder Steve Jobs first announced the Macintosh

computer 30 years ago.



Shrouded in mystery, one can only guess at what the California-based company

will announce. Evidence and history point towards a brand new iPhone, rumors and

speculation call for a wearable device, no one will know until the unveiling on

Tuesday. We spoke with Canalys' China mobility analyst Wang Jingwen about what

Apple might have in store.



Of course, Tuesday is still a ways off; we can speculate all we want. Here are

five things that we expect will happen on Sept. 9.



Wearable Device



Wang expects the big reveal on Tuesday will be Apple's first foray into the

wearable computing space. She says that while it can't determined what the name

and what the final scope of the device will be, Apple is expected to pull out a

wearable, be it a fitness band or a watch.



A move by Apple into this space is heavily anticipated. Other brands such as

Motorola and Samsung have already announced and released smartwatch companion

devices for their phones.



Wang says that Apple's device could be similar to a companion device, one that

requires an iPhone to run.



A new iPhone or rather two iphones



Traditionally speaking, Apple has announced a new iPhone in it's September event

every year. Last year, they announced the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, the year

before that, the iPhone 5. This year, Wang says iPhone will announce the iPhone

6.



"We expect there will be two iPhones this year, a 4.7 inch screen model and a

5.5 inch screen model," said Wang.



Leaks of the new "bigger" iPhones have been slowly trickling out all summer.

Wang says that despite the unconfirmed nature of the leaks, they have been right

in the past and moving to bigger screens is something that can put Apple back

into competition with Android smartphone makers.



The upgrades and features of the 4.7 inch phone



As per new upgrades, Wang says the new iPhone, whatever it'll end up being

called, will sport new features that make it more power than the previous

generation.



Such features are unknown right now but history shows that there will at least

be a major software update. Apple is expected to release the eighth version of

it's iOS operating system with the launch of the new iPhone.

The 5.5 to be more powerful



While both new models are expected to be upgrades of the current set, Wang says

that there maybe a big difference between the 4.7-inch model and the 5.5-inch

model.



"I believe that we should watch for the differences between the 4.7 model and

the 5.5 model," said Wang. "The differences in the models won't just end at

screen sizes.



Wang expects the 5.5-inch model will be a bigger upgrade than the 4.7-inch

model. She says that the 5.5 may come with better hardware compared to its

smaller brother. She implies that the 5.5-inch model may be even more powerful

than the 4.7-inch version.



Apple to release the new phones with China being one of the first countries to

see a release



Last year, Apple released the iPhone 5c and 5s were released in China during the

first wave. This was the first time that China included among the list of

countries to receive the iPhone first. Previously Chinese Apple fans had to wait

longer periods of time before the device could be purchased on the Chinese

mainland. Wang says, this year, China will mostly likely still be part of the

first countries to receive the new device.



"China has become an important market for Apple and the iPhone will probably

release in China the same time it hits the United States," said Wang. "This

year, it'll be problem free, with the LTE issue being solved."



Last year, despite China being a launch country, Apple released an LTE free

version of the iPhone first in the country. LTE is a mobile broadband technology

that allows for faster downloads and Internet surfing.



However, Wang does warn that there maybe differences in release dates for the

bigger 5.5-inch iPhone and the possible wearable device. She expects the base

4.7-inch "iPhone 6" will launch first at the same price point as the iPhone 5s.

She says the 5.5-inch and the wearable will probably come some time later.
