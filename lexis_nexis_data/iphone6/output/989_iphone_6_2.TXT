China Telecom confirms Apple iPhone 6 4.7-inch specs



LENGTH: 284  words





Once again, telecom operator China Mobile has put up specs details of the Iphone

6 4.7-inch model, which confirms that its launch is imminent. The specs details

have been put up a few hours ahead of the Apple event, where the company will

finally be unveiling the most awaited Iphone 6 models, including the 5.5-inch

variant and the 4.7-inch variant, along with the iWatch and iOS 8.

Interestingly, the leaked details differ from what is known so far, and

highlights some changes in the specifications that have been suggested by

earlier reports



As per the specs details listed on the telecom operator's website, the iPhone 6

4.7-inch variant will come with an Apple A8 chipset with quad-core CPU, and will

be available in 16/32/64/128GB variants. The 4.7-inch display is touted to come

with 1134 x 750 pixels resolution, which does not seem much attractive

considering that flagbearers of other top tier brands flaunt much higher

resolution. The display will however be covered by sapphire glass, as was

suggested by earlier reports.



As per the China Mobile's sign-up page, the iPhone 6 will sport an 8-megapixel

rear camera and a 2.1-megapixel front-facing camera. It will measure at 138x67x7

mm. Another interesting point to notice is that the phone is touted to be water

and dust resistant.



Considering that China Mobile has listed only the 4.7-inch variant of the iPhone

6, it is likely that Apple might first launch the iPhone 6 5.5-inch variant in

the US only due to limited stock of the device, and bring it to other markets

later this year or by early next year.



A recent report mentioned that both the variants of the iPhone 6 will be

available from September 19, however this could be in the US only.
