While the Internet is still full of news of the upcoming iPhone 6 which is

rumoured to be launched in August, we are getting alleged leaked images of the

new phone.



GSMArena has posted pics of the new phone leaked last week- comparing to iPhone

5S and iPod. One pic also featured the iPhone 6 dropped in water. Wither it is

water resistant or it is a non-working prototype.



The iPhone 6 is under production in China and leaked in dimension of 7mm and 6.1

mm thickness. "Apple security in China seems to have really broken down as an

iPhone 6 dummy was photographed all around a city", says the news report.
