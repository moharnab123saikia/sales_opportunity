It is expected that Apple will release its next iPhone this year in an Annual

event. The phone which  has been rumoured as the iPhone 6 runing the latest

operating system iOS 7 might see a launch this year in Summer.



According to iGeeksblog (http://www.igeeksblog.com/iphone-6

-release-date-set-for-june-businessinsider-reports/), Brian White of Topeka

Capital (a well-known analyst circles) has been quoted by BI

(http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-6-2013-1) that the iPhone 5s successor

would be coming in with more color and screen options. Another story in the same

blog (http://www.igeeksblog.com/ios-7-release-date/) confirmed that Apple is

working on the iOS 7 which will come with the 'next iPhone device'. Another

report in Expertreviews (http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/mobile-phones/1297255/

iphone-6-release-date-specs-what-we-know-so-far) also confirmed the iPhone 6

under process and said "the latest information suggests that the Apple A7

processor (http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/mobile-phones/1298617/iphone-6

-a7-processor-being-built-not-for-iphone-5s) is now being finished by the Taiwan

Semiconductor Manufacturing company. It appears as though, the final design will

go in March, then move to risk production in May-June."



This phone is expected to be launched in May or June this year. This is what

Brian White speculated. Peter Misek, analyst at investment firm Jeffries & Co

also indicated a mid 2013 release. "Our checks indicate that preliminary builds

for the iPhone 5S will start in March for a launch in June/July" Mac Rumours
