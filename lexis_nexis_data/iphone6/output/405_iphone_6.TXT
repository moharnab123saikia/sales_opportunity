event. The phone which  has been rumoured as the iPhone 6 runing the latest
operating system iOS 7 might see a launch this year in Summer.

According to iGeeksblog (http://www.igeeksblog.com/iphone-6
-release-date-set-for-june-businessinsider-reports/), Brian White of Topeka
Capital (a well-known analyst circles) has been quoted by BI
(http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-6-2013-1) that the iPhone 5s successor
would be coming in with more color and screen options. Another story in the same
blog (http://www.igeeksblog.com/ios-7-release-date/) confirmed that Apple is
working on the iOS 7 which will come with the 'next iPhone device'. Another
report in Expertreviews (http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/mobile-phones/1297255/
iphone-6-release-date-specs-what-we-know-so-far) also confirmed the iPhone 6
under process and said "the latest information suggests that the Apple A7
processor (http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/mobile-phones/1298617/iphone-6
-a7-processor-being-built-not-for-iphone-5s) is now being finished by the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing company. It appears as though, the final design will
go in March, then move to risk production in May-June."

This phone is expected to be launched in May or June this year. This is what
Brian White speculated. Peter Misek, analyst at investment firm Jeffries & Co
also indicated a mid 2013 release. "Our checks indicate that preliminary builds
for the iPhone 5S will start in March for a launch in June/July" Mac Rumours
