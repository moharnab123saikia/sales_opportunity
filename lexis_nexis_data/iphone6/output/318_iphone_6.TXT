Apple iPhone 6 alleged official photo leaks before official launch



LENGTH: 211  words





A Chinese carrier China Telecom seem to have accidentally posted a photo

revealing Apple's much talked about and awaited Iphone 6 on the Chinese social

networking website Weibo. The photo looks like a press render of the phone and

highlights a tagline saying 'even better', confirming the launch of the Iphone 6

with a bigger display and better features on September 9.



First spotted by Sina News, the photo seem to have been posted accidentally and

was soon been taken down from the site. The photo does not only show off the

curved-edge design of the iPhone 6, but also confirms that it would be called as

the iPhone 6. Recently, leakster Feld & Volk too had posted a photo of the

iPhone 6, which showed off a Samsung-like curved side profile of the phone. The

photo also shows that iPhone 6 will come in three colors- silver, grey and gold.



This is not the first time that the iPhone 6 has been spotted online, as there

have earlier been a number of specification-, photo and video-leaks which have

revealed most of the design elements of Apple's yet to be announced iPhone 6. So

far, reports have revealed that the iPhone 6 will don a new design with 4.7-inch

and a larger 5.5-inch display size, come with slightly rectangular keys, and

bring a protruding rear camera.
