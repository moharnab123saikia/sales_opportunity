THE queue for the new iPhone 6 was as good a place as any to get some work done

as the clock ticked towards a minute past midnight.



Lower Hutt resident Ben Vaughn wasn't going to miss the chance to get his hands

on Apple's latest release last night.



The 27-year-old, who had nestled into one of the bean bags at the front of the

queue outside Vodafone's flagship store on Lambton Quay at 5pm, hasn't missed a

single iPhone release since 2008. "I was in the queue for a 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5,

5s and now the 6," Vaughn said.



The comfort of the bean bag also helped him be productive as he counted down

until the doors opened. "I'm doing some work."



However, it was 18-year-old Dannie Barker of Paraparaumu, who was in

pole-position to get her hands on the first iPhone 6 sold in Wellington.



Supported by her mum, the iPhone and Apple fan was keen to upgrade the "old

brick" she was being forced to use.



"I had to sell my iPhone 5c to pay for this one," she said.



Dannie's brother was also queuing - nearly 650km away.



Dedicated mum Debbie said: "I've got my daughter in a queue in Wellington and a

son in a queue in Auckland. They are great kids and have worked hard to buy an

iPhone."



The Barkers were an iPhone family and did not want to have to wait months before

owning the latest model. "I'm also the ride home," Debbie said.



The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were launched in 10 "first wave" countries, including

the US and Australia, a week ago. New Zealand is one of more than 20 countries

in the second wave.



International demand for the new devices has been high, with Apple booking a

record 4 million pre-orders on the first day they could be produced, and

reporting sales of more than 10 million in the first weekend.



Among changes from earlier models, the phones have larger screens - the iPhone 6

a 4.7-inch display and the 6 Plus a 5.5-inch.
