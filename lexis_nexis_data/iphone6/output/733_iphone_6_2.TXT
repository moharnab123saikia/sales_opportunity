Have you heard? There's a new iPhone coming out. Actually, there are two new

iPhones coming out. And here is all the things you really need to know about it.



1 The iPhone 6 will come in two new sizes, one slightly bigger than the 4in

screen on the iPhone 5S with a 4.7in screen, and one massive one (called iPhone

6 Plus) with a 5.5in screen. The new iOS software will allow you to use a

special iPad-style landscape display which will display some side-list info in

apps like email. The screens are even higher resolution than before, with 401ppi

on the Plus.



2 There's a barometer in the phone which uses air pressure to measure elevation.

In other words, when you're running or cycling with it, it can tell when you're

going uphill and how high you go...



3 The camera is better - in so many ways. Even though the 8MP sensor has the

same number of pixels as in the iPhone 5S, all sorts of tweaks to hardware mean

much better images. There's an all-new sensor, and software improvements bring

faster focusing and image stabilisation. Great improvements, too, to video

capture - especially some wonderful stabilisation, which works wonders with

shaky hands.



4 It'll run iOS 8, obviously, which features all the advantages of improved

messaging, the new health app, and notifications from all your favourite apps.

iOS 8 will be out on September 17 for other devices.



5 A new service - called Apple Pay - will allow you to 'seamlessly' pay for

things with your iPhone 6.  Or at least it will when it's 'eventually' available

in the UK. Al payment info is encrypted in the device and is never seen or

stored by third parties.



6 It will be available on September 16, but you can order one on September 12.

iPhone 6 comes in gold, silver or space grey, and will be available unlocked

from Apple for £539 for the 16GB model, £619 for the 64GB model and, for the

first time, a new 128GB model for £699. iPhone 6 Plus comes in gold, silver or

space grey, and will be available for £619 for the 16GB model, £699 for the 64GB

model and £789 for the new 128GB model.
