Forget Scottish Independence for a minute - tomorrow is the biggest day of the

week.



Friday will see the brand spanking new iPhone 6 released across the globe, with

manufacturer Apple reporting record numbers of pre-orders from consumers.



Of course, that's hardly a surprise that around 4 million phone lovers have

placed orders. People everywhere are desperate to get their hands on the latest

technology - and the smart iPhone 6 and slightly larger model 6+ mark another

leap forward from Apple.            What is it?



The new iPhone comes in two separate models.



There is a standard 4.7-inch iPhone 6 version which is set to take the baton

from the iPhone 5S, and an iPhone 6+ which boasts a 5.5-inch screen in an aim to

bridge the gap between mobile phones and tablets.            What are the

differences?



Erm, to be honest, not a lot.



Aside from the screen, both models have pretty much the exact same qualities

except the iPhone 6+ boasts an upgraded camera. Hardly surprising, is it, given

the screen size?



Both versions boast longer battery life and better performance than their iPhone

4 and 5 counterparts, with both models offering iOS 8.            How much is

it?



Here are the price breakdowns for the iPhone 6:



16GB: £539



64GB: £619



128GB: £699



And the iPhone 6+:



16GB: £619



64GB: £699



128GB: £789



Different networks offer different pricing plans and costs.            Why

should I get one?



If you aren't somebody tempted by fashions and fads, maybe you will be swayed by

the iPhone 6's avant-garde model designs and improved technology and better

performance.



The model's curved edges mean you have the power button on the side of the model

rather than the top and, because of the bigger screen, double-clicking the

centre home button brings up all your app icons within a thumb's reach.



The camera has improved, too, with faster autofocus and next-gen local tone

mapping.



The better battery life is obviously a huge draw for workers, with iOS 8

offering them improved performance and connectivity so you can reply to e-mails

and messages reliably and promptly.
