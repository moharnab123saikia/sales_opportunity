KOLKATA: Apple India has set a target to double iPhone sales to two million

units and revenue to more than Rs 8,000 crore during its financial year to

September 2015 as it focuses on e-commerce for the first time in the country.



The American company's bullishness springs from the strong demand for iPhone 6,

which continues to see more orders than the company is able to fulfill despite

having sold 500,000 units during October-December 2014 or half of what it had

sold in India in the entire previous fiscal, as per market trackers.



The company also expects that 20-25% of iPhone sales during the fiscal will be

generated from e-commerce, said two senior trade partners of Apple India.



"Apple's headquarters have given the target to the Indian unit to double iPhone

sales this fiscal since it had a fantastic first quarter and also focus on

e-commerce to push sales of slow moving models like iPhone 4S and 5c," said one

of the executives.



The executive said Apple's distributors are already running promotional offers

on iPhone 5c through Amazon and have even undertaken joint marketing investment

for advertisement campaigns. "E-commerce was never a focus area for Apple India

till now but the growth of the channel has made it sit up to focus on such

sales," the executive said.



An email sent to Apple spokesperson in regional headquarters in London did not

elicit any response till Wednesday evening.



Market tracker Counterpoint Research senior analyst Tarun Pathak said Apple

doubling sales in India this fiscal won't be a difficult target for the

Cupertino-based vendor, considering the high average selling price of the new

iPhone 6 and 6 Plus that account for bulk of the sales.



As per estimates, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus - which are priced upwards of Rs 52,000 -

account for 50% of total iPhone sales in India by volume and more than 80% by

value.



While Apple has regularized supplies for iPhone 6 16GB model, supplies of

another top-seller iPhone 6 64GB are still erratic in India, something that the

company expects to normalize soon, trade partners said.



While iPhone is the market leader in smartphone segment priced above Rs 30,000,

it is the second largest after Korean giant Samsung in the Rs 20,000-plus

smartphone category.



In the overall Indian smartphone market, Apple had slightly over 2% share in

October-December quarter, as per estimates by Counterpoint Research, while

Samsung led the market, followed by Micromax.



As per filings to the Registrar of Companies, Apple India has grown sales

sevenfold over the past three years to Rs 4,479 crore in 2013-2014 from Rs 620

crore in 20101-11. Profit after tax doubled to Rs 119 crore in 2013-14 from Rs

58.6 crore during this period.
