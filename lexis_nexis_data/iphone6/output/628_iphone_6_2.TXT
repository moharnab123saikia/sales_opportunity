

Apple Inc.'s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones were released at 8 a.m.
Friday at Apple stores and other mobile phone shops around the country, where
enthusiastic fans formed long lines.

In front of Apple Store Omote-sando in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo, more than 1,000
people had formed a line several hundred meters long by the time of the official
release.

"It's thin and fits my hand well," said self-employed Yuki Manno with an iPhone
6 in his hand. "The screen is easy to see. I want to test out the phone all day
today."

Three major mobile phone companies -- NTT DoCoMo, Inc., KDDI Corp. and SoftBank
Mobile Corp. -- also held events at their outlets in Tokyo to announce the
release of the new models.

The new iPhones have bigger screens and thinner bodies than their predecessors.
The screen of the iPhone 6 Plus is bigger than that of the iPhone 6. An iPhone 6
model with 16 gigabytes of memory is virtually free if a user signs a new
contract or switches over from another mobile service provider.

Firms are engaging in fierce competition to win more customers with a variety of
promotional campaigns including one offer to buy an old iPhone for up to 43,200
yen if users agree to change their mobile service providers.
