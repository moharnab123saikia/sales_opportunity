analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

"Problems Apple is facing with the expected 4.7-inch iPhone 6 are even more
challenging for the 5.5-incher, possibly leading to delays", says Kuo in a
research note, says Cnet (via MacRumours)

According to MacRumours, "As in-cell touch panel becomes larger in size, the
edge of the panel may become insensitive to touch" which could be a bottleneck
in the production of the new handset. Apart from this producing large sized
sapphire glass display has been one of the early concerns regarding iPhone 6
production.

Kuo believes that by the end of this year 2014, the new bigger iPhone 6 might
not launch. In which case Apple could probably reduce the price of iPhone 5S and
5C as its launches the 4.7 inch iPhone 6.

This year the Cupertino company is expected to launch a new iPhone 6 with an
iWatch in September.
