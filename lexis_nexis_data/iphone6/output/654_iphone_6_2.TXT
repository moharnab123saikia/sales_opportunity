The bigger iPhone 6 could take more time for launch, indicates KGI Securities

analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.



"Problems Apple is facing with the expected 4.7-inch iPhone 6 are even more

challenging for the 5.5-incher, possibly leading to delays", says Kuo in a

research note, says Cnet (via MacRumours)



According to MacRumours, "As in-cell touch panel becomes larger in size, the

edge of the panel may become insensitive to touch" which could be a bottleneck

in the production of the new handset. Apart from this producing large sized

sapphire glass display has been one of the early concerns regarding iPhone 6

production.



Kuo believes that by the end of this year 2014, the new bigger iPhone 6 might

not launch. In which case Apple could probably reduce the price of iPhone 5S and

5C as its launches the 4.7 inch iPhone 6.



This year the Cupertino company is expected to launch a new iPhone 6 with an

iWatch in September.
