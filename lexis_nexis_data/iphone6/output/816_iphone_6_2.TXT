Yes. Even Batman was at the launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus yesterday.

At 8am employees in fancy dress at Telstra's Stockland Gladstone store greeted
about 15 customers who queued outside.

"I've been using a borrowed phone for a few months waiting for the new iPhone to
be released," said Lauren Padmos.

Mrs Padmos, who was with her two young sons, signed up for a new $70 plan with a
16GB silver iPhone 6.

"My new plan is similar to my old one.

"I don't need the extra memory because I don't store photos on it," she said.

Self-professed Apple addict Zac Fraser was served by Batman.

He wanted a 128GB iPhone 6 Plus but was told he'd have to wait until the second
delivery later in the day.

"I'm so excited. I'm a massive fan of Apple products and this is an extension of
it," he said.

"I time my phone plans so they run out when a new iPhone is released," Mr Fraser
said.

At Optus' Stockland Gladstone store Shaylah Alexander was waiting for a silver
128GB iPhone 6.

"I don't think my old plan has run out yet. But I don't mind," she said.

Matthew Dodds was hoping to get an iPhone 6 Plus but Optus manager Sian Marsh
said they wouldn't be available for three weeks.

Mr Dodds isn't too worried.

"My old phone works just fine.

"I'll get one online later," he said.
