iPhone 6 rumor rollup for week ending Jan. 11;

Smaller, cheaper; bigger, cheaper; bigger, more expensive

Even without Apple being at the gigantic Consumer Electronics Show this week in

Las Vegas, it proved to be a treasuretrove of iPhone 6 revelations for those

with the wit to look beneath the surface of things.



Things like IGZO screens. And Gorilla Glass 3.



Also this week: The sky darkened under the crisscrossing trajectories of

contradictory speculation: The Next iPhone would be smaller and cheaper; and

bigger and cheaper; and bigger and more expensive. Or something.



IN THE NEWS: Will Apple introduce a lower-priced iPhone?



You read it here second.



__________ __________ And they didn't even realize it! Not so sharp, after all,

apparently.



GottaBeMobile's Adam Mills found Sharp's booth, at the Consumer Electronics Show

(CES), where the company was proudly showing its IGZO display technology. (You

can check out GottaBeMobile's video, which shows a prototype tablet sporting the

prototype display.) "Sharp not only showed off flexible displays like Samsung,

but maybe more importantly, the company showed off its IGZO display technology,

the same technology that has been rumored to be coming with the next iPhone

model, presumably called the iPhone 5S or the iPhone 6," Mill announced, just in

case you weren't au courant with the IGZO rumors, which are almost as tediously

repetitive as the rumors that Apple's next iWhatever will have a fabulous

Liquidmetal body.



IGZO displays can be brighter, higher-than-1080p resolution, and much more power

efficient than conventional displays, according to Sharp, which with several

other display vendors is a major supplier to Apple.



In a few sentences, possibly using copy/paste or a macro, Mills deftly summed up

months of rumors about the next iPhone. And then he ruined it all at the end.



"Keep in mind, Apple rumors often don't pan out so it's possible that Apple will

go in a different direction with the new iPad and the new iPhone in 2013," he

wrote.



No one has yet connected the dots between another CES reveal and the Next iPhone

: TrackingPoint's Precision Guided Firearm (PCWorld has details), which marries

a high-tech digital scope and sensors with a custom-built Surgeon Rifles

bolt-action long rifle. Among other things, the PGF uses Wi-Fi to display its

high-tech in-scope image and data on its accessory iPad mini. Using the Next

iPhone and a new software protocol, iShoot, to remotely control the rifle,

upload photos and video to iCloud, and automatically sync calendars with your

local butcher is an obvious next step.



If only we could have CES once a month instead of once a year.



Jonathan Leggett, of USwitch.com, was hanging around in Vegas, too, and took

note of Corning's announcement that a "new strain of Gorilla Glass purported to

be three times tougher than the version currently in service on top-end

smartphones, paving the way for a new generation of more robust handsets."



And one Very Special New Generation Handset in particular.



According to a March 2012 post by 9to5Mac's Seth Weintraub, Apple and Corning's

relationship has been "shrouded in mystery."



The glassmaker was never mentioned in Apple marketing material and "even isn't

included in Apple's supplier lists," he wrote.



But on March 2, 2012, "Apple released its US Jobs report which included the

following info: 'Corning employees in Kentucky and New York who create the

majority of the glass for iPhone...,'" Weintraub noted.



"Debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show this week, Gorilla Glass 3 has been

conditioned to be less brittle than ever before thanks to an ion-bonding

treatment and some clever atomic jiggery-pokery that we're not even going to

pretend to understand," Leggett wrote, with disarming humility. (But the neat

British-ism "jiggery-pokery" usually suggests trickery or underhandedness rather

than manipulation.) With somewhat less humility, Leggett didn't hesitate to draw

the obvious conclusion.



"With rumours indicating that Samsung could opt for a plastic screen for its

next kit - possibly even a flexible one - we think [GG3 is] most likely to debut

on the sixth-gen iPhone," he declared. "Especially given that Gorilla Glass has

featured in every iPhone since the iPhone 4 dropped back in 2010."



Without a trace of irony, a BGR post this week says that a "new report adds

weight to recent rumors" that Apple will launch more than one iPhone model by

mid-2013.



The "report" is that treasure trove of firsthand, in-depth knowledge called the

Note to Investors, this one by stock analyst T. Michael Walkley, of Canaccord

Genuity. In the note, Walkley "sees," according to BGR's Zach Epstein, "Apple

launching a new 'higher-end iPhone' sometime in the June quarter, and a low-end

model could be in the works as well."



Whoa. Not just a cheaper iPhone 6-or-whatever but also a more expensive one!



According to BGR, Walkley wrote, "We believe Apple could launch a higher-end

iPhone model by the June quarter versus its more typical September/October

timing for a new iPhone launch. We also believe Apple could potentially launch a

lower-end iPhone focused on more price-sensitive pre-paid markets, as we believe

consumers in markets such as China, Latin America and Eastern Europe would have

very strong demand for a more affordably priced 3G iPhone."



Walkley clearly is willing to take the Rumor Games to the next level, since

among the most fecund of recent rumors has been the one insisting that Apple

must, must introduce a less expensive version of the iPhone, or face Collapse,

Failure, Utter Destruction, and the End of the World. [See "Will Apple introduce

a lower-priced iPhone?"] Probably the more expensive Next iPhone will have a

much larger screen, in super high-def with IGZO, a quad-core processor, bigger

battery, a kaleidoscope of colors, and Gorilla Glass 3 if not 4. Oh yes: and NFC

contactless payments.



For a long time, the Rollup has boycotted any mention of "concept art," a.k.a.

"fan art," that purports to show what the Next iPhone will look like, based on

current rumors, febrile imagings, or certain organic chemical agents. Or some

combination thereof.



But when Macworld Australia's Ashleigh Allsopp headlines her post, "Is this what

Apple's iPhone 6 will look like?" we'll make an exception.



Although she doesn't answer the headline's question, we will boldly go where so

far no one apparently has and say, "Uh, no."



"New images of a potential iPhone 6 design have been created based on an alleged

test prototype, sporting a similar shape to the latest iPod nano," Allsopp

reveals.



The renderings are the latest by a talented Italian designer, Federico

Ciccarese, with the Twitter handle @ciccaresedesign, a website where he posts

these illustrations, and an acknowledged need for some work assignments.



Ciccarese mentions something about his newest creations being based on some

iPhone test prototype, but in practice it looks like he just "grew" the iPod

nano into the Next iPhone. And added something called "iOSX," a hybrid blend of

iOS and OS X.



And this is what he comes up with.  Here is his previous rendering of the

expected iPhone 5, and you can judge for yourself how closely that resembled the

final product.  This is getting confusing, even by the standards of iOSphere

rumoring: smaller and cheaper; bigger and more expensive; bigger but cheaper;

more expensive but smaller. All of the above.



A characteristically brief and anonymously sourced story at International

Business Times repeated the rumor that "according to supply-chain sources,"

Apple will introduce a low-cost version of iPhone for China and similar markets,

in the latter half of 2013. So far, so yawn.



But there was this little iOSphere twist: "Some sources claimed that they have

seen the sample of the low-cost iPhone, which will come with a larger display

..." So the intensely rumored "iPhone mini" moniker refers to the phone's price,

not its dimension.



The reasons for the cheaper but bigger iPhone 6? "Growing sales of the iPad mini

... may have served as an impetus for Apple to roll out a low-cost iPhone ..."

And "Qualcomm's recent launch of its latest family of Snapdragon chipsets ...

for the entry-level to mid-range smartphones may pave the way for Apple bringing

out the low-cost iPhone ..."



The latter reason is a bit odd, verging on a technical non sequitur. Because

Qualcomm offers the ARM-based Snapdragon as a mobile system on a chip, with the

processor integrated with a bunch of other components. With the iPhone 5's A6

chip, Apple apparently has for the first time custom-designed its own ARM-based

main processor, manufactured by Samsung. Apple does use Qualcomm's mobile data

modem chipsets, but not the Snapdragon.



"You'd think if Apple wanted to make a low-cost iPhone, it would be small,"

wrote Dave Smith, at International Business Times, after reading the DigiTimes

account of unsupported anonymous speculation. "An 'iPhone nano,' if you will."

(Smith must have been watching Frederico's design blog!) You would think that.

But you would be wrong. Apple is, after all, magical.



"If DigiTimes' sources are correct, Apple's "low-cost iPhone" could easily look

like a Galaxy S3 smartphone, and given its 'low cost,' it might even compete

with Samsung's prices, too," Smith concluded.



So if DigiTimes' sources are correct, Apple is going to imitate the Galaxy S III

and voluntarily start a price war with Samsung.



DigiTimes and various stock analysts agree, according to Smith: "Apple wants to

sell a lower-priced iPhone. Whether the 'iPhone 6' will be bigger or smaller has

yet to be determined; Apple simply wants it to be cheaper." Clearly. "The

obvious explanation: A cheaper iPhone -- easily the company's most popular

product -- would help Apple penetrate some key markets, particularly those

Eastern, lower-income areas like China and India."



We can hear Apple CEO Tim Cook now, the new Colossus gazing to the East and

crying out, "Give me your tired, your poor, your lower-income huddled masses

yearning to buy an Apple iPhone, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send

these, the phoneless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my cheaper iPhone 6 beside the

golden door."
