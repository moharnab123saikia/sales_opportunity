LENGTH: 144  words





Apple Iphone 6 is one of the biggest launches of the year, and its craze can be

seen across the world. Though iPhone mania is not an old story, owing an Iphone

6 has become such a big deal that a man from Saudi Arabia even didn't mind

demanding for a brand new unit of the latest iPhone as dowry from another man

seeking to marry his sister.



The iPhone 6 is already high in demand, and is highly desired especially in the

countries where it is yet to come on sale. Saudi Arab is one such Middle Eastern

countries where the iPhone 6 is not yet available officially, and is expected to

come at an obnoxious price. Now, according to The Times Of India, an Arab man

demanded for an iPhone 6 in dowry from a man who proposed to marry his sister,

and conditioned that the marriage would happen only if the new iPhone is

delivered to him as soon as it is available locally.
