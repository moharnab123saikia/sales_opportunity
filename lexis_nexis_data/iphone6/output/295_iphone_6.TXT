launched on 21 September 2013.

Saturday, May 31, 2014: The next generation of the iPhone will reportedly be
launched in September this year. According to a report by German blog Apfel
Page, Germany's Deutsche Telekom has informed its customers that the probable
availability of the iPhone 6 will be on September 19. This is not the official
word from Apple. The company has remained tight lipped about the release date
for the iPhone 6.

The Cupertino, California based technology giant is expected to showcase the
next version of its mobile operating system, iOS 8, at the Worldwide Developer
Conference on 5 June in San Francisco. Not only is the company expected to
showcase the OS, Apple is also expected to disclose the public availability
dates for it.

The 19 September launch date for the iPhone 6 makes sense since Apple has been
launching devices around this time usually. The company launched the iPhone 5 on
20 September 2012, while the iPhone 5S was launched on 21 September 2013.

The iPhone 6 is expected to hold the next version of Apple's mobile processor
(the version succeeding the A7 seen in the iPhone 5S) along with a high
resolution Retina display. In addition, the company has been rumoured to be
working on a higher resolution for the iPhone 6 displays.

The iPhone 6 will be followed by the launch of the iPhablet, which will be
Apple's biggest device till date. The iPhablet will have a 13.2-cm (5.5-inch)
display.
