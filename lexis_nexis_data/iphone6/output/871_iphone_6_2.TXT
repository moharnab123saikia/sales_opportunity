Apple stores and other retailers to get their fingers on the new iPhone 6.

But long lines   and a high inventory of phones   were hard to come by in York
County.

"Good luck finding people in York who want to dish out that kind of money for a
new phone," said Rob Erwin, a West Manchester Township resident.

Prices range at various retailers and increase or decrease based on storage,
trade-ins and phone service plans.

For example, a new iPhone 6 with 16-gigabytes of storage is $649.99 at Verizon
without a contract or financing plan, or $199.99 with a two-year contract.

Cynthia Zborowski said she and her husband couldn't wait to get their new phones
at the local Verizon store on Friday morning. With an upgrade and new plan, she
expected to spend about $300.

"It's well worth it," the Manchester resident said. "I really like the bigger
screen and clearer picture."

The iPhone 6 has a 4.5-inch touchscreen, and the iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch
screen   which seems "a million times bigger" than her older model's 4-inch
screen, Zborowski said.

While some York County residents left the Verizon store at 2196 White St. in
West Manchester Township with phones in hand, others were disappointed they
couldn't buy them yet.

Heather Backus was surprised when she left Walmart at West Manchester Mall.

"They don't have the new phones in the store yet, but you can get an old iPhone
for 97 cents. I'm thinking of getting those as Christmas presents," the West
York resident.
