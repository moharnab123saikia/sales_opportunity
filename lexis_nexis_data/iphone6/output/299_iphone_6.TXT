HIGHLIGHT:Â The latest rumours and specs from Apple's next mobile flagship.





Another year, another iPhone. But with the competition pulling away, Apple must

innovate to keep up with better screens, larger phones, and more health related

features. Will the iPhone 6 be bigger than 5 inches? What processor will be

inside? And where will the home button go? Read on to examine the rumours

bouncing around the web about Apple's next iPhone, the iPhone 6.



Judging by the launch of the iPhone 5S and 5C in September 2013, an iPhone 6 is

likely to appear in September 2014. However, there have been rumours about the

release of a larger-screened iPhone, a model that can compete with the

ever-increasing size of competitor Android devices. We may see a 5-inch or

larger screened iPhone appear in the Summer.



Comments made by Apple CEO Tim Cook during a 2013 Q4 conference call appear to

support an Autumn iPhone 6 release date:



"You will see exciting new products from us in the fall and across 2014. I stand

by that and you've seen a lot of things over the last couple of months," Cook

said.



Other rumours allude to the iPhone 6 being released in June at the Worldwide

Developers' Conference, alongside iOS 8.



The company that provides materials for the sapphire screen display, which is

thought to be featured on the iPhone 6, said that it expects 2014 to be a

'transformational year'.



GT Advanced, which undertakes the production of sapphire materials, said: "Our

results for the December quarter were in line with our guidance and the

anticipated growth trajectory of our business remains unchanged. We expect to

return to profitability during the second half of 2014."



'Return of profitability during the second half of 2014' sounds a lot like the

iPhone 6 will be released then.
