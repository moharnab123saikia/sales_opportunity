Another year, another iPhone. But with the competition pulling away, Apple must
innovate to keep up with better screens, larger phones, and more health related
features. Will the iPhone 6 be bigger than 5 inches? What processor will be
inside? And where will the home button go? Read on to examine the rumours
bouncing around the web about Apple's next iPhone, the iPhone 6.

Judging by the launch of the iPhone 5S and 5C in September 2013, an iPhone 6 is
likely to appear in September 2014. However, there have been rumours about the
release of a larger-screened iPhone, a model that can compete with the
ever-increasing size of competitor Android devices. We may see a 5-inch or
larger screened iPhone appear in the Summer.

Comments made by Apple CEO Tim Cook during a 2013 Q4 conference call appear to
support an Autumn iPhone 6 release date:

"You will see exciting new products from us in the fall and across 2014. I stand
by that and you've seen a lot of things over the last couple of months," Cook
said.

Other rumours allude to the iPhone 6 being released in June at the Worldwide
Developers' Conference, alongside iOS 8.

The company that provides materials for the sapphire screen display, which is
thought to be featured on the iPhone 6, said that it expects 2014 to be a
'transformational year'.

GT Advanced, which undertakes the production of sapphire materials, said: "Our
results for the December quarter were in line with our guidance and the
anticipated growth trajectory of our business remains unchanged. We expect to
return to profitability during the second half of 2014."

'Return of profitability during the second half of 2014' sounds a lot like the
iPhone 6 will be released then.
