iPhone 6s/7 rumours: Smartphone features super-sized selfie camera and comes in

PINK;

Latest leaks provide clearest evidence of Apple's selfie-obsession - but will

its new hue scare off men AND women?

The upcoming iPhone could feature a beefed up selfie camera and will probably

come in the world's most controversial colour: pink.



Fresh leaks have hinted at the pastel ambitions of Apple, as well its desire to

help the selfie-obsessed people of the world take pictures of themselves.



The blog 9to5Mac has published an advert from accessory manufacturer Spigen, who

are preparing to make a phone case in the same "Rose Gold" shade Apple is

expected to debut at its iPhone launch event on September 9.



Apple's colour decision is likely to be controversial, as feminists have long

railed against pink's association with femininity and delight in highlighting

sexism wherever they imagine it to be present.

The website has also obtained fresh pictures of the new smartphone showing its

super-sized selfie camera, which is expected to have a front-facing flash to

light up your self-portraits, and the sensors which power the mobile's

pioneering Force Touch feature.



We'd like to take a moment to tell (or warn) Apple about the Pink Stinks

campaign , which urged parents to avoid buying rose-coloured gifts for young

girls.



The thrust of the campaigners' arguments is that pink is somehow "sexist",

leading the young women who wear it into a dead end of vapid niceness.



Boys, on the other hand, are ushered into a life of purposeful, thrusting

success by wearing the colour blue which, apparently, makes them "bold and

challenging".



All of which leads us to ask.



Is the iPhone 6s/7 sexist?



Whilst you're chewing over that question, here's a round up of all the iPhone

intelligence we've gleaned so far:



Apple iPhone 7: Price



If the rumours of a smaller, cheaper iPhone 6C are true then it's unlikely that

Apple's main iPhone 7 will be any easier on the wallet than past models.



Most experts reckon the new iPhone will start at £539 for a 16GB model,

effectively taking the place of the current iPhone 6 - which will see an

incremental drop in price.



If true, we could expect other models with larger storage - 64GB and 128GB most

likely - to stick with the £619 and £699 prices. Apple iPhone 7: Release date



We'll see it officially revealed on September 9.



Both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 5S were revealed in September and Apple has no

reason to change its strategy. It will look to take advantage of Black Friday

sales and the run up to Christmas.



Alongside the iPhone 6S, Apple is also expected to reveal the iPhone 6S Plus and

potentially an iPhone 6C . Apple iPhone 7: Camera and design



Expect this phone to be a snapper's delight, with a 12 megapixel camera and the

ability to shoot 4K video.



It will probably include a front-facing camera flash - something currently

unavailable on any existing model of iPhone.

In terms of design, the iPhone 6 was a big change from the iPhone 5S and it's

unlikely Apple will redesign the appearance two years running.



Having said that, both Samsung and LG have embraced curvy screens with the

Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and the LG G Flex 2 respectively.



It's unlikely Apple will follow suit but then the world's most valuable company

has frequently had a problem with bending phones .



And yet, the latest set of rumours suggest that Apple will be introducing a

brand new colour into the mix. We're expecting the usual space grey, silver and

gold options but how about...pink?



A set of images appearing on Chinese social media appear to show a fully-formed

2015 iPhone with a pink case.



Apple usually refers to this colour as "Rose Gold" when it's talking about the

Apple Watch - so it could be producing this new version of the iPhone to match

its smartwatch.



Screen size is perhaps the most contentious issue. Some rumours have suggested

Apple will reveal three handsets this year , each with a different screen size.



Alongside the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch upgrades to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, some

rumours have suggested a smaller iPhone 6C could be revealed with a 4-inch

screen.



If true, it would give Apple a "budget" option to appeal to those who don't want

to fork out for the larger phones. Apple iPhone 7: Specs



Because the new iPhone will arrive with Apple's iOS 9 software and an upgraded

processor, it will offer even more power and better efficiency.



According to a report from Reuters , Apple's arch-nemesis Samsung will be

responsible for building 75% of the new processor.



Likely to be called the A9 chip, the new beating heart of the iPhone will be

smaller than the previous iteration - allowing engineers to cram even more

transistors onto the silicone.



At the moment, we don't know what kind of battery the iPhone 7 will use - but at

least there's now a Low Power Mode built into iOS 9 to help it last even longer.



So far, Apple has resisted updating the random-access memory (RAM) of its

smartphones, but some sources expect the new model to have at least 2GB of RAM

on the clock.
