Muscat: Apple fans in Oman who are planning to lay their hands on the new iPhone

series have to shell out between OMR500 and OMR900, said traders having the

price list.







"The price list we have got from dealers in Dubai shows that the iPhone 6 16GB

version will cost OMR540 and iPhone 6 Plus 16GB version will cost OMR680," said

a sales representative at Smart Zone.



Apple this week unveiled the two latest models in its iPhone series, both of

which boast a larger screen, in a bid to recapture its role as a technological

trend-setter and many in Oman are waiting to own the new handsets.



According to the trader, iPhone 6 16GB will cost OMR540, 64GB will cost OMR590

and 128GB will cost OMR640. The iPhone 6 Plus 16GB will cost OMR680, 64GB OMR790

and 128GB will cost OMR890.

"These are the initial prices sent by dealers in Dubai. Now, we have to get the

Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRA) permission for sale. Most probably, the new

iPhones will be available by the last week of this month," said the sales

representative.



"Apple products always have a high price during the launch. Depending on the

region and country the price varies. Even the iPhone 5s had a high price range.

The price of the starting model was nearly OMR500 when it was launched. But that

never deters Apple's ardent fans. Here too, Omanis are not bothered about the

price. Some want it at any cost," said the trader.



Price details

Meanwhile, after Times of Oman reported the price details first, the social

networking websites were abuzz with comments.



While many were surprised with the price, some even related the news story of a

salary hike survey prediction.



Apple's online store crashed under the weight of demand from eager customers

hoping to pre-order one of the new iPhone 6 models launched this week.



The company announced it would make pre-orders, but in minutes it had begun

displaying "We'll be back" messages in several languages.



Twitter users reported problems with sites around the world before services

appeared to have been restored after 30 minutes.



Meanwhile, people who were lucky enough to have secured pre-orders for the first

iPhone 6 shipments are now flogging their prizes on eBay in a bid to rake in

more than $1,000 in profits.



According to Apple's official website, the price of iPhone 6 16GB is $199 for US

customers while the iPhone 6 Plus 16GB will be at $299 with a two-year contract.
