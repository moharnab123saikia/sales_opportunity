Thais have proved second to none when it comes to adopting new gadgets after all

55,000 units of the new iPhone 6 sold out within hours of its preorders.



True Corporation allowed preorder customers to pick up the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

Plus at its CentralWorld shop at midnight Friday.



Advanced Info Service Plc, the largest mobile operator, and Total Access

Communication Plc which operates the DTAC brand, also said their quotas were

filled within minutes after they started accepting preorders on Oct 24,

according to a Matichon Online report.



Papon Ratanachaikanont, a group executive director of True Corp, said the iPhone

6 had attracted more interest than its predecessor iPhone 5s, with all 20,000

iPhone 6 units sold out in one third of the time it took for the previous model.



True will have the new model for sale at its shops from Nov 3.



"True Move H recorded the highest iPhone sales and as a country on Apple's tier1

list, there will be no shortage of the products," he said.



Thitipong Kiewpaisal, AIS's vicepresident for marketing, shared the same view,

saying the iPhone 6 sold more quickly than its predecessor.



"Negative news about bending body and explosion has not affected sales," he

said.



AIS sold 15,000 units at the launch.



DTAC senior vicepresident Pakorn Pannachet said the company sold all 20,000

units of its quota in two hours but customers could start buying them at DTAC

centres now.



"Initially, there might be a shortage but it shouldn't last long given

Thailand's status on Apple's tier1 list. DTAC hopes to sell 100,000 units of the

model over the next 12 months," he said.



The iPhone 6 handsets are priced 24,60037,300 baht depending on capacity.
