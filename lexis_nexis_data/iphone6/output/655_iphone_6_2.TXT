7 - it couldn't have got better news.

Research firm Strategy Analytics has some good tidings for the smartphone:
Apple's iPhone 6s model was the world's top-selling smartphone in the second
quarter of 2016.

According to a report by Strategy Analytics, the Apple iPhone 6 shipped 8.5
million units worldwide for the second position and 2 per cent marketshare
during the second quarter of the year. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge was in the third
place with 8.3 million and 2 per cent share.

While the tech world is going into a frenzy over the "what-if-what-not"
announcement from the Apple stable, many enthusiasts are looking at purchasing
the iPhone 6. The reason being that they are expecting with good reasons for the
prices to come down.

Traditionally, Apple has dropped the price of its previous iPhone version by
$100 which would make the 16GB model $549. So there is hope after all.

The iPhone 6 starts at $549 and the 6 Plus is $649. If the iPhone 6s's price
drops by $100, either the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will have to be retired or have
their prices dropped further. Considering Apple's tendency to have limited
product offerings that is a possibility.
