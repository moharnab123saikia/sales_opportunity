Even as Apple gears up for new offerings - presumably in the form of the iPhone

7 - it couldn't have got better news.



Research firm Strategy Analytics has some good tidings for the smartphone:

Apple's iPhone 6s model was the world's top-selling smartphone in the second

quarter of 2016.



According to a report by Strategy Analytics, the Apple iPhone 6 shipped 8.5

million units worldwide for the second position and 2 per cent marketshare

during the second quarter of the year. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge was in the third

place with 8.3 million and 2 per cent share.



While the tech world is going into a frenzy over the "what-if-what-not"

announcement from the Apple stable, many enthusiasts are looking at purchasing

the iPhone 6. The reason being that they are expecting with good reasons for the

prices to come down.



Traditionally, Apple has dropped the price of its previous iPhone version by

$100 which would make the 16GB model $549. So there is hope after all.



The iPhone 6 starts at $549 and the 6 Plus is $649. If the iPhone 6s's price

drops by $100, either the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will have to be retired or have

their prices dropped further. Considering Apple's tendency to have limited

product offerings that is a possibility.
