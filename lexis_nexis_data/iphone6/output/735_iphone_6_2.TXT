class action suit in Federal Court (Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-00916) against
Apple Computers, Inc., in relation to Apple`s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The
complaint alleges Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have 2 touch IC chips which
were not properly secured to the logic board causing them to fail prematurely.

The complaint alleges that while there are temporary fixes, such as purchasing a
new IPhone 6, or installing a new logic board, the same result will ultimately
occur.

The complaint alleges that many users have come across these problems after the
warranty has lapsed, costing users hundreds of dollars to try to fix their
phones.
