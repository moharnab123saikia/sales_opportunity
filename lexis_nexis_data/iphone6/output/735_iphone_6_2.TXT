Christensen Young & Associates Sues Apple in Federal Court over Alleged iPhone 6

and iPhone 6 Design Flaw



LENGTH: 139  words





(PRWeb) - On Wednesday, August 31, 2016, Christensen Young & Associates filed a

class action suit in Federal Court (Civil Action No. 2:16-cv-00916) against

Apple Computers, Inc., in relation to Apple`s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The

complaint alleges Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have 2 touch IC chips which

were not properly secured to the logic board causing them to fail prematurely.



The complaint alleges that while there are temporary fixes, such as purchasing a

new IPhone 6, or installing a new logic board, the same result will ultimately

occur.



The complaint alleges that many users have come across these problems after the

warranty has lapsed, costing users hundreds of dollars to try to fix their

phones.
