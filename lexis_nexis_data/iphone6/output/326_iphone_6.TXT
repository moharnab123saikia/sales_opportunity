To much anticipation and fanfare, the first iPhone was released in June 2008,

with the 4 gigabyte model priced at $499 and the 8 gigabyte model at $599, both

requiring a two-year contract. FormerApple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the new

device in January 2007 at the Macworld convention in the Moscone Center in San

Francisco, Calif. Jobs touted the phone's ability to serve as a music player,

mobile phone and internet browser all-in-one. The first generation iPhone would

go on to sell 6.1 million in more than five quarters.

June 9, 2008, and began selling the second generation iPhone in July. The

slogan"twice as fast, for half the price"bragged about the price-reduction of

the new phone at $199 for the 8 gigabyte model, as well as several new hardware

features like GPS and 3G data plans. One of the most important new features came
