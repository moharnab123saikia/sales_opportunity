The wait will end in just a week but iPhone 6 and the leaking channels are not

at all tired with their activities.



Monday, September 01, 2014: There seems to be no end to iPhone 6 leaks this year

as every week there is something new for you. Even after the Cupertino firm's

official invitation for the 9 September event, here comes one more leak now. We

have gone through all kind of possible leaks for the device before.



Now a video has been released showing a fully functional 11.94-cm (4.7-inch)

iPhone 6 with evidence that the leaked device is not Apple made but has been

assembled with leaked parts. The video has been created by Feld & Volk, the

maker of Apple cases and accessories. The iPhone 6 is shown in silver colour and

it's connected to an iMac. The phone displays the 'Connect to iTunes' screen

after it gets booted.



But the user is unable to connect as the iMac shows a message that, "iTunes

could not contact the iPhone software update server because you are not

connected to the internet." The video also shows an iPhone 5s along with the

iPhone 6 as the previous one can successfully connect to the iTunes screen. The

Mac points out that the iPhone is not Apple made and has been put together from

leaked parts. Several inconsistencies could be spotted as the device is running

on iOS 7 and iOS 8, defying the expectations.



The website notes that the colour of the iTunes logo shown on the device's

'Connect to iTunes' screen in the video is blue and white, the colour of iOS 7.

iPhone 6 is awaited in iOS 8 where the iTunes logo is orange and white. A gear

icon also appears on the screen before showing the 'Connect to iTunes' screen

after being paired with the iMac. The design of the device, as shown in the

video, is in line with previous leaks.



In the past too, several iPhone leaks have been offered by Feld & Volk and it

seems that it has access to a limited edition of Apple parts. But all

speculations will come to an end by next week when the iPhone 6 is launched next

week, 9 September, finally. But, in the meantime, so more leaks are also

expected. So watch this space for more.
