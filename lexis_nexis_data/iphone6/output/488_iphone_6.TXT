Stop twiddling your thumbs for the next iPhone. If a report from Recode is

accurate, Apple is prepping to launch the iPhone 6 very soon.



According to the report, Apple will be hosting an event on September 9. The

company is known to reveal its new smartphones at events taking place in Fall,

so expect a look at the new iteration of the iPhone on the day.



The rumor mill has been pretty active lately, suggesting that Apple may release

two iPhones this year: a 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch model. It would be interesting

to see how Apple tackles a bigger screen as iPhones have traditionally been

modeled to be used with a single palm.
