APPLE broke its own records over the weekend selling more than 10m iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus devices.



Last year, Apple sold 9m of its iPhone 5S and 5C in 11 countries. This year it

exceeded that figure despite launching in just 10 countries, missing out on the

huge Chinese market where it is unlikely to sell the iPhone 6 until 2015.



"Sales for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded our expectations for the launch

weekend, and we couldn't be happier," said Apple's chief executive Tim Cook.



Apple's manufacturing partner in China, Foxconn, reportedly has 200,000 workers

across 100 production lines producing around 140,000 iPhone 6 Plus and 400,000

iPhone 6 devices every day.



"While our team managed the manufacturing ramp better than ever before, we could

have sold many more iPhones with greater supply and we are working hard to fill

orders as quickly as possible," added Cook.
