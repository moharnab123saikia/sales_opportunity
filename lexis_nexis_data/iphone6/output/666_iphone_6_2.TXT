Apple revealed the latest version of the iPhone in front of 7,000 people in San

Francisco last night.



As expected, the world's biggest tech company delivered an 'S' version of its

two current smartphones: the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.



The two new gadgets will keep the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes of last

year's phones, Apple has added some extra features and improved the performance.

Along with a better camera, new pressure-sensitive display and a brand new

display, Apple also revealed how much it'll cost and when you can get it.



See our round up of the 4 cheapest ways to get your hands on the new iPhones.



Both the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus will be available to pre-order from

September 12 at 8.01am. Not long to wait, then.



The actual phones will be released just under a fortnight later on September 25,

2015.



And, if you were under any illusions about how popular this gadget is likely to

be, it turns out people are ALREADY queuing up to be the first to get hold of

one.



Apple has kept the pricing the same as it was for your last year's phones. Which

is to say: they aren't cheap.



The 16GB SIM-free version of the iPhone 6s will set you back £539. The SIM-free

64GB version costs £619 while the SIM-free 128GB is a whopping £699.



That increases if you decide to go for the larger iPhone 6s Plus, which starts

with a SIM-free price of £619 for the 16GB version.



The SIM-free 64GB model is £699 and the top-tier SIM-free 128GB iPhone 6s Plus

costs £789.



The new blower has made improvements to the screen with a new '3D Touch'

feature.



It will register varying levels of pressure, and respond differently depending

on how hard you press it.



Apple has also increased the quality of the camera on the back of the phones to

12-megapixels, improving on the 8-megapixels of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.



As well as taking better pictures, the new iPhones will be able to shoot video

in 4K quality - which is four times as detailed as regular high definition

video.



There's also more power thanks to a brand new processor it calls the A9.



It's 70% faster than iPhone 6's A8 chip on CPU tasks, or 90% on graphics.



Will you be queuing up to buy the new iPhone?
