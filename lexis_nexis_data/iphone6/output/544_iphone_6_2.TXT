could change with the iPhone 6.

A source in the tech supply chain in China and Taiwan told Cantor Fitzgerald
analyst Brian White that the Apple iPhone 6 is expected to launch in Q2 or Q3
2014. That would mean the rumored bigger-screen iPhone would come out between
April and September.

An April release would be just seven months after the Sept. 20 debut of the
iPhone 5 S and 5 C handsets. Since the first iPhone launched in June 2007, the
quickest Apple has come out with a new iPhone has been 11 months.

Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Chris Caso said Wednesday he expects the
iPhone 6 to come out late in Q2 2014, or nine months after the iPhone 5 S and 5
C.

Apple might be feeling pressure to come out with new smartphones faster because
its chief rival, Samsung, is on a rapid release cycle. This year, Samsung has
flooded the market with niche versions of its Galaxy S4 smartphone and Galaxy
Note 3 phablet. They include a ruggedized smartphone (Galaxy S4 Active), a
handset with a high-resolution camera (Galaxy S4 Zoom) and a phablet with a
curved glass display (Galaxy Round).

In a research note Thursday, White said the bigger screen iPhone would have a
display approaching 5 inches, vs. 4 inches for the iPhone 5 series. Jefferies
analyst Peter Misek said in a research note Mondayresearch note Monday
