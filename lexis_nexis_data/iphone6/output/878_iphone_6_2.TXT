Apple to launch an 'all glass' iPhone in 2017, claims analyst



LENGTH: 257  words





Apple will completely redesign the iPhone, which will feature the return of an

all-glass enclosure, claims KGI Securities' analyst.



According to Ming-Chi Kuo, who is dubbed the best Apple AAPL -2.02% analyst on

the planet, Apple will do away with the ranges' famed aluminium chassis and in

its place will be the return of an all-glass enclosure. This will also be

complemented by new cutting edge curved OLED display.

The changes, which are said to be launched in 2017, will see Apple 'tick/tock'

external redesign/internal upgrade pattern. Consequently the iPhone 7 will look

largely like the iPhone 6/iPhone 6S and it will be an 'iPhone 8' in 2017 where

Apple will pull out all the stops.



Interestingly, this isn't the first time Apple will be using glass. The company

enjoyed mixed success with the material in the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. Cracked

backs plagued these stylish phones, but Kuo argues that advances in toughening

glass since then should address this. Glass would also be ideal for wireless

charging and boosting antenna reception.

So, will Kuo's report prove to be true? Only time will tell. However, it should

be borne in mind that the analyst had previously broken news of the radical

12-inch MacBook, iPad Pro, the shift to 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes with

the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, nailed every major feature of the iPhone 6S four

months ahead of launch and revealed the iPhone SE, including its lower pricing.
