Apple may go big and bigger with the iPhone 6 this year.



Nikkei reports that the iPhone 6 will release in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch variants,

which are both larger than the tiny 4-inch screen of the iPhone 5S, and a unique

move to cater to multiple markets at once.Â There is no mention if the smaller

iPhone 6 will be a 'mini version' of sorts.



The report also claims the smartphones will release in September.



Last month, we got a rough leak on the supposed final look of the iPhone 6,

showcasing a larger screen, ultra thin bezel, and of course, the TouchID-enabled

Home Screen button.
