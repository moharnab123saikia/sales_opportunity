iPhone 6 leaks again with a 6mm thinness, could be called iPhone 6C



LENGTH: 287  words





iPhone 6 has done it again. The Apple phone has leaked again via the French site

Nowhereelse. The website has leaked a video of a 'dummy' iPhone 6 handset

revealing this phone to be thin at 6mm.



Earlier the same website posted protective shells that will soon be marketed by

Chinese prop for the iPhone 6. This case measured as a fit for 4.7 inch phone

with buttons placed on both left and right side, instead of left side as in

iPhone 5S. There was one button on the right side while two on the left side.

These was a space above the volume rocker, probably for a USB/lightening

connector.



This time, the dummy has leaked showing a thinner look, which in a way

consolidates the rumours of a thinner and lighter 2mm battery inside the pack.

"It confirms the thickness of 6mm, which was recently suggested by a schematic

plan", the news report says. (via Google translate)



According to a report in DailyMail today, earlier this month, a Japanese

magazine has published drawings of what purported to be a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch

iPhone 6C. The use of product code 6C intrigues us. Like the iPhone 5C and

iPhone 5S (in 2013) after the iPhone 5 in year 2012, are we going to witness

iPhone 6C and and 6S this year?



Since Apple is rumoured to launch two phone of different display sizes in two

events - one in August and another in September this could be a possibility. A

report in Reuteres earlier in May this year pointed at an iPhone 6 with 4.7 inch

display screen at a launch event in August (at least a month earlier than its

usual launch time every year) while the a 5.5 inch or 5.6 inch display screen

model could see a launch in September.



Another leaked information earlier pointed at a waterproof model of the upcoming

phone.
