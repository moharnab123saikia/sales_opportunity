FOR fans of Apple's iPhones, this could be the year that good things come in

threes.



There are reports that Apple is planning to go one better this year and unveil

three new models of the iPhone in September.



Twice before, Apple has rel-eased two iPhones at one time.



Two years ago, it was the iPhone 5S and the colourful but only slightly cheaper

iPhone 5C.



Last year, Apple unveiled the new bigger iPhone 6 and the even bigger iPhone 6

Plus.



Now Digitimes is reporting that Apple will unveil a collection of three iPhones

this year.



Alongside the expected upgrades with the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, Digitimes

says there will be an iPhone 6C.



Some dismiss the iPhone 5C as Apple's one failure with an iPhone, with much of

the criticism focusing on the flawed perception that C would stand for "cheap"

and Apple does not do cheap.



According to the report, the 6C will have a 4-inch (10.1cm) screen, making it

significantly smaller than the 4.7-inch (11.9cm) iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch (14cm)

iPhone 6.It will be powered by the A8 chip, while the two flagship phones will

use a more powerful A9 chip.
