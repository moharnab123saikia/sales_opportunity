Apple iPhone 6 Meets Consumer Size Requirements Says Strategy Analytics



LENGTH: 276  words





Tuesday, September 30, 2014: Apple announced two new smartphones on September

9th, 2014 at an event in California - the iPhone 6, with a 4.7-inch display and

the iPhone 6 Plus, with a 5.5-inch display, alongside the Apple Watch.



The Strategy Analytics Wireless Device Lab (WDL) report, "Smartphone Size

Preference H1 2014: Overall Preference Remains at 4.7 inches" found that in the

first half of 2014 consumers were most likely to consider a device with a

display size of 4.7" - the same size as the newly announced iPhone 6.



The report also found that 91% of existing iPhone owners chose a device

prototype larger than their current handset size as their most preferred, with

4.5" and 4.7" prototypes the ones most likely to be considered. iPhone owners

are also likely to prefer slightly smaller devices compared to existing Android

owners.



Exhibit 1: Current iPhone Owners Likelihood to Consider



Paul Brown, report author and service director at Strategy Analytics, commented,

"The size of the iPhone 6 should meet current requirements of existing Apple

owners, as well as having the potential to win back some previous iPhone owners

who had defected to Android handsets as their desire for larger handsets was

unmet by Apple."



Kevin Nolan, vice-president of the UX Innovation Practice, added, "With

consumers preferring an incremental increase in size over their current device,

and overall interest in phablets being lower, we expect that the iPhone 6 Plus

will appeal to a smaller segment of the market compared to the iPhone 6 - those

who are prepared to sacrifice the convenience of a smaller device for an

enhanced multimedia and productivity experience."
