

Sept. 19--Retailers in Erie opened their doors to customers eager to purchase
the iPhone 6 this morning.

"We've been busy since we opened our doors at 9 a.m.," said Steve Bullis, store
manager of Verizon Wireless at 5043 Peach St.

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which were announced Sept. 9, are slimmer than
previous versions, but have bigger displays. Where the iPhone 5 was 7.6 mm wide,
the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1 mm wide and the iPhone 6 is 6.9 mm wide.

"We have a limited supply in store today and we had a chunk of ones that
customers ordered today as well," Bullis said. "Customers can come in today and
order a phone. The sooner they get here, the sooner the phone will ship."

The iPhone 6 pricing starts at $199 and the iPhone 6 Plus starts at $299.
