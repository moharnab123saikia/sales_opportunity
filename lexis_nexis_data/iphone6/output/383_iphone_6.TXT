thinner than the current model.

A video was uploaded to YouTube that claims to feature one of the first cases
made for the iPhone 6. If the case really is for Apple's next iPhone, then
customers should expect the iPhone 6 to be even thinner than the current iPhone
5s.

According to the video, the next iPhone will have the same thickness as the
current iPod Touch devices. That means the thickness of the iPhone will drop
from 0.30 inches to 0.24 inches.

Besides a thinner body, the iPhone 6 is also expected to feature a larger screen
than the iPhone 5s, which comes with a 4-inch display. Various reports have said
the iPhone 6 could come in two versions: one with a 4.7-inch screen and another
with a 5.5-inch screen. No announcement on the iPhone6 is expected before
September.
