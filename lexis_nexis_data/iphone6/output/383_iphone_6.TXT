MORE rumours of Apple's upcoming iPhone 6 surfaced, saying the device may be

thinner than the current model.



A video was uploaded to YouTube that claims to feature one of the first cases

made for the iPhone 6. If the case really is for Apple's next iPhone, then

customers should expect the iPhone 6 to be even thinner than the current iPhone

5s.



According to the video, the next iPhone will have the same thickness as the

current iPod Touch devices. That means the thickness of the iPhone will drop

from 0.30 inches to 0.24 inches.



Besides a thinner body, the iPhone 6 is also expected to feature a larger screen

than the iPhone 5s, which comes with a 4-inch display. Various reports have said

the iPhone 6 could come in two versions: one with a 4.7-inch screen and another

with a 5.5-inch screen. No announcement on the iPhone6 is expected before

September.
