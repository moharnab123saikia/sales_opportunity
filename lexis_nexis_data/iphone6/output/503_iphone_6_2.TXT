Apple sales soar after launch of iPhone 6



LENGTH: 304  words





The record-breaking launch of the iPhone 6 has seen Apple secure 40 per cent of

British smartphone sales, its highest level yet.



The September launch sent Apple's share of sales up 10.4 percentage points,

according to the latest figures for the three months to October from Kantar

Worldpanel ComTech.



The figures show early adopters of the iPhone 6 are typically 16 to

24-year-olds, who made up 34 per cent of sales, and male (64%).



The top reasons shoppers gave for choosing the iPhone 6 were 4G capability

(51%), screen size (49%) and design (45%).



The iPhone 6 outsold the larger 6 Plus version by four to one, Kantar Worldpanel

said.



But it said every new iPhone release saw a significant increase in Apple's share

of sales, and this occasion was no different.



Across Europe, Android sales still lead at 69.4 per cent despite falling 2.5

percentage points. while Apple's iOS is up 5.7 percentage points to 20.7 per

cent due to the iPhone 6.



Windows is in third place with 8.7 per cent of the market.



Kantar Worldpanel ComTech strategic insight director Dominic Sunnebo said:

"Apple has experienced a huge jump in sales share across almost all major

markets thanks to the launch of the iPhone 6.



"In major European economies, the US and Australia, Apple's share of sales has

risen. This success is particularly evident in Great Britain where Apple now has

its highest ever share of sales, with 39.5 per cent.



"Most of these sales were driven by loyal Apple users. Some 86 per cent of

British buyers upgraded from an older iPhone model.



"Only five per cent switched across from Samsung."



The launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus led to Apple reporting a net profit of

$8.5 billion  (£5.3bn) for the final quarter of 2014.



The figure is one billion higher than the same quarter last year, and revenue

was also up by almost $5bn (£3.1 billion)
