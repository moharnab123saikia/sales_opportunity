The brand new model from Apple hits stores worldwide tomorrow with an

unprecedented demand as the iPhone 6 and 6+ looks to set records.



Around an estimated 4 million people are said to have signed up to receive the

new model, which boasts increased battery life and productivity as well as an

enhanced camera and sleeker look.



The increase in screen size from 5 inches to 6.5 inches on the 6+ model has

raised eyebrows in some quarters, with some suggested that the smartphone is

becoming too similar to a tablet to truly succeed.



Whether that stunts the success of the iPhone 6 - which has already been lauded

as a huge step forward in Apple's technology - remains to be seen.



Upon the eve of the iPhone 6's release, we take a look back on the previous

models of the Apple iPhone. After all, everybody's got one, haven't they?
