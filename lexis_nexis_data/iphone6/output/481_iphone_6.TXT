For Apple fans, discussing the upcoming launch of iPhone 6 has become a part of

their daily chat sinceiPhone 5C and iPhone 5S hit shelves last September.



A series of pictures reportedly of iPhone 6, the upcoming version of Apple's

smartphone device, was released on Thursday morning by Australian blogger Sonny

Dickson on sonnydickson.com.



Rumors suggest that the screen of iPhone 6 will be bigger than the screen of

previous versions. The design will be like a cross between the current iPad Air

and the iPod Touch. It will be definitely thinner than the current iPhone 5S,

says Dickson.



Meanwhile, @mornray886, a random twitter account, that has also posted the same

pictures has already scooped more than 300 followers on the micro-blog site.



According to an earlier report by Reuters, Dickson, an Australian teenager who

lives in suburban Melbourne, attracted attention in August after he released

detailed pictures and videos of the new grey and champagne casing on the

upcoming Apple products.



He accurately posted the details on his site about iPhone 5C that came in

plastic colors and the casings for the iPad Air, and theiPad Miniwith Retina

display, said Business Insider.



He has five to ten sources in China who buy Apple prototype parts directly from

factory-line workers, which are then sold for $250 to $500. His sources then

send him photos and videos of the parts, which are posted under his name on his

website and YouTube channel, which generate ad revenue, said Reuters.
