LENGTH: 245  words





Those awaiting to get their hands on the biggest ever-Iphone model will be

delighted to know that the company will indeed launch the iPhone 5.5-inch

variant as well as put it on sale on september 19, along with the iPhone

4.7-variant. Apple Insider is reporting that Apple would be launching the Iphone

6 5.5-inch model, however only in limited numbers.



Apple is gearing up to finally unveil the next generation iPhone models along

with its long awaited iWatch, and an update to the iOS to 8th version at its

WWDC event today in San Francisco. Rumors have it that the company will launch

two New Iphone variants including a 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch model. Earlier

reports suggested that the company might unveil the iPhone 6 5.5-inch and iWatch

at the event though it might not bring these to market due to manufacturing

delays and issues. However, a new report has surfaced online hinting that the

company would indeed put the iPhone 6 5.5-inch model on sale alongside the

iPhone 6 4.7-inch on September 19. Though, there could only be limited stock for

the biggest ever-phone model due to the rumored production issues of the phone.

It is likely that the company might put limited stock for the iPhone 6 5.5-inch

model but have good numbers of units of the iPhone 6 4.7-inch model.



As far as the certainty of date is concerned, the September 19 date makes sense

as the company's history has suggested that it put the new iPhones on sale two

Fridays after they are announced.
