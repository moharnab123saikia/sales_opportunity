

SAN FRANCISCO - Apple moved to recapture its role as the leading tech
trend-setter as it unveiled its first smartwatch and two large-screen versions
of the iPhone.

It also said it was introducing a mobile wallet that would allow consumers to
simply tap their phones to pay retailers, aiming to popularise the idea of
mobile payments.

The Apple Watch, a sleekly designed wrist device that links to the iPhone, "will
redefine what people expect from this category", chief executive Tim Cook said.

Also unveiled were the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, in a large boost to the
screen size of the popular handsets.

The iPhone 6 will have a screen of 4.7 inches and the 6-Plus will be 5.5 inches,
allowing Apple to adapt to consumers' apparent preference for bigger displays.

The new iPhone 6 will start at the same price of existing iPhones at $US199
(A215) for US customers while the iPhone 6 Plus will be at $US299 with a
two-year contract.

Apple said the devices would be available in at least 115 countries by the end
of the year.
