Ahmedabad: Six days after it was officially launched in the state, Apple's

iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus are getting an overwhelming response from the fans

across the state.



"There has been an overwhelming response from Gujarat for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

plus. Of the three variants available for each of these phones, the 128 GB

variant is the most popular one. In fact, we are out of stock for the 128 GB

iPhone 6, as we did not expect so much demand for the most expensive of the

models of the new Apple device. We have been getting many calls and inquiries

for the same," said Shekhar Singh, corporate communications manager of an

e-retail venture, Infibeam.

sold in Ahmedabad alone.

across Ahmedabad are around 300. This makes an average of more than Rs2 crore

spent by city-dwellers on iPhone.



Nilpesh Chavda, a resident of Bopal told dna, "I am keenly waiting for the new

iphone 6 plus that I have booked after paying Rs80,500. I am a fan of Apple

gadgets and I don't mind spending even up to Rs1.5-2 lakh to get these devices.

Apart from twhe new iPhone, I also look forward to Apple's smart watch."

Reviewers have rated the phone as the best in Apple's range so far and indeed

worthy of the obeisance people across the world have been paying to it. The

device boasts of a LED-backlit IPS LCD, capacitive touch screen with 16M colors,
