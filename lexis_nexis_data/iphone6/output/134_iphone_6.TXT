Dubai: Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones will be available to order

in the UAE starting September 27, according to Apple's online store in the

country.



The tech giant revealed on Tuesday the new iPhones, as well as a line of

smartwatches, called the Apple Watch.



Retailers in the UAE, too, say they expect to start selling the smartphones

around the same time.



"It will be the first time ever that the iPhone will be available in the UAE

within a week of the US launch, which just goes to show the increased importance

Apple is beginning to attach to the Middle East market," said Nadeem Khanzadah,

head of retail at Jumbo Electronics.



The new iPhones could be sold during Gitex Shopper, a consumer electronics

exhibition that will be held from September 27 to October 4 in the Dubai World

Trade Centre, according to Ashish Panjabi, COO of Jacky's, a consumer

electronics retailer.



Apple said the new iPhones will be released in select countries from September

19, while pre-orders will be available from September 12. The Apple Watch, which

is priced from $349 (Dh1,281), is expected to be released in early 2015.



"For the Apple Watch, we have no indication [on its UAE launch]," said Neelesh

Bhatnagar, chief executive of consumer electronics retailer Emax.



The iPhone 6 will be priced Dh2,599 (16GB), Dh2,999 (64GB) and Dh3,399 (128 GB),

while the iPhone 6 Plus will cost Dh2,999 (16 GB), Dh3,399 (64GB) and Dh3,799

(128 GB), according to Apple's online store in the UAE.



Telecom operator Etisalat confirmed to Gulf News that it will launch the new

iPhones on September 27. Du, too, said that it will offer the smartphones from

September 27. Customers can pre-order the devices from September 19.



The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus come in screen sizes of 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches

respectively.



Both smartphone models feature new generation retina displays, called Retina HD.

The iPhone 6, with a 1334x750 resolution, has 38 per cent more pixels than the

iPhone 5s, while the iPhone 6 Plus, with 1920 x 1080 resolution, has 185 per

cent more than the iPhone 5s.



The new iPhones also have the A8 processor, which is 25 per cent faster than the

A7, and have graphics that are 50 per cent faster. The devices will run on iOS

8, which will be released on September 17 as a free download.



In terms of features, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users can expect an improved

8-megapixel iSight camera with quicker autofocus, make calls over a Wi-Fi

network, and pay for things in retail stores with Apple Pay, which has a

built-in near field communication (NFC) capability, a technology that allows

devices to exchange information wirelessly.



Both smartphone models will be available in silver, gold, and space grey.



Meanwhile, the Apple Watch is built from custom alloys of stainless steel,

aluminium, and 18-karat gold, and comes in two sizes and three collections.



It features a range of apps, such as Nike+ Running, which allows users to track

their runs; a BMW app, which displays information like their car's charge level

and where to park; and default apps, such as photos, maps and messages.



The Apple Watch has to be connected to an iPhone to be able to use the apps.
