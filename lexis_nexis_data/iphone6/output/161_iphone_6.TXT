Biggest Apple Larger screen drives record iPhone sales

Size did indeed matter for iPhone fanatics.



Apple broke its record for an iPhone launch, selling more than 10 million of the

larger-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models combined in the three days since they

went on sale Friday.



Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday called it "the best launch ever," crowing that the

iPhone 6's debut weekend in 10 countries ended up "shattering all previous

sell-through records by a large margin."



By comparison, Apple sold a combined 9 million of the iPhone 5s and less

expensive 5c last year - but that figure included sales in China, the largest

smartphone market in the world, where regulatory issues have so far delayed the

introduction of the iPhone 6.



Demand for the new devices outstripped supply at many Apple retail locations and

phone carrier stores across the U.S. - especially the iPhone 6 Plus, its 5½-inch

screen making it the larger of the two new gadgets.



Apple last week warned that some consumers who preordered online would face

delays of up to four weeks on the 6 Plus, and up to 10 days on the 6.



"We could have sold many more iPhones with greater supply and we are working

hard to fill orders as quickly as possible," Cook said Monday.



Last weekend's sales were double the iPhone 5's 5 million inaugural sales in

2012, the last time an iPhone underwent a design change.



Apple previously sold 4 million of the iPhone 4s and 1.7 million iPhone 4

handsets during their weekend kickoffs.



The iPhone 6 rollout resumes Friday in more than 20 countries, and will be

available in 155 countries by year's end.
