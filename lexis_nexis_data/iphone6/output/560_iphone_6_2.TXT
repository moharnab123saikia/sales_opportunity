New Delhi, April 6 -- Zee Media Bureau

 When Apple Inc launched the 4-inch iPhone SE in India, the tech giant hailed it

as the cheapest iPhone ever and priced it at Rs 39,000 for the 16GB model much

to the despair of fans.





 As the cheapest iPhone, fans expected it to be around Rs 25,000 considering

that the US price of USD 399 converts to just about the same.

 However, fans of Apple were shocked at the Rs 39,000 pricing of the new iPhone

SE.

 And while only the 16GB model was launched then, the price of the iPhone SE

64GB model has been revealed too.

 The price of the iPhone SE 64GB model has been pegged at a ridiculous Rs

49,000.

 Priced at USD 499, it should have converted to about INR 33,000. However, the

tech giant seems to have it priced much higher than expected in India.

 Cheapest iPhone did they said?

 16GB model of iPhone 5S is available for just about Rs 18,000 while the iPhone

6 16GB model is now available for Rs 40,000 only.

 And considering the iPhone 6S and iPhone S Plus failed due to its high price,

Apple could perhaps reconsider the price again for the iPhone SE.
