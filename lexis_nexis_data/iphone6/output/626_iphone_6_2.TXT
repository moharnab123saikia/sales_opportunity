Apple said it sold a record 10 million iPhones in the first weekend after its

new, larger phone models went on sale in 10 countries on Friday.



The phones, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, drew more than 4 million pre-orders on

Sept. 12, more than double the 2 million orders for the company's iPhone 5 model

in the same period two years ago.



Analysts had estimated first-weekend sales of up to 10 million iPhone 6 and

iPhone 6 Plus models, based on the first-day pre-orders.



Last year, Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5S and 5C models in 11 countries,

including China, in the first weekend. Sales of the new models in China have

been delayed by regulatory issues. (Reuters) For more visit www.businessworld.ie
