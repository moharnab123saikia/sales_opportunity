MIRRORLESS CAMERA



$2,599 (body only), available from Sept 8



Fujifilm has launched the X-T2, the successor to its critically acclaimed,

two-year-old X-T1. It retains most of the SLR-like design of its predecessor but

has added a rear joystick for easy change of focusing points.



It has been upgraded with a new 24.3-megapixel X-Trans CMOS III APS-C image

sensor and the latest X-Processor Pro image processor and has two SD-card slots.

Onkyo E700M



IN-EAR HEADPHONES



$139



For audiophiles who listen to high-resolution audio (High-Res) the Onkyo E700M

is worth checking out. Said to be optimised for High-Res playback, it comes with

13.5mm drivers that are tuned to bring out crisp details and subtle nuances,

while its lightweight aluminium housing is built to eliminate unwanted

vibrations that might mar the sound.



It comes with three different-sized ergonomically shaped silicone ear tips and a

tangle-free cable with an in-line remote-and-mic unit.



Aztech PSD500



STORAGE DONGLE



$99, available this month



You can now create your own personal cloud with the Aztech PSD500. Dubbed the

Personal Storage Dongle, it has an Ethernet port at one end and a USB port at

the other.



This allows you to connect any USB hard drive (up to 2TB) to the PSD500, and

hook the PSD500 to your router to create your own cloud storage. You can then

access your files using the Aztech Storage app (available on both Android and

iOS) on your smartphone anywhere, as long as you have an Internet connection.



PowerColor Red Devil Radeon RX 470 4GB GDDR5



GRAPHICS CARD



$319



The PowerColor Red Devil RX 470 graphics card features 4GB of GDDR5 memory with

2,048 stream processors and 1,750MHz clock speed for great gaming performance.

It uses the new Double Blade III cooling fan, which has more blades than

conventional fans, to increase airflow and prevent dust deposition.



This Red Devil also supports the latest graphics technologies, such as DirectX

12, Vulkan, FreeSync and Liquid VR.



Mosclean



HOME APPLIANCE



$88



Unlike traditional mosquito traps that use harmful chemical sprays or a

high-voltage metal grid, the Mosclean is a safer and more environmentally

friendly version.



Using ultra-violet LEDs with an optimised light wavelength and a special coating

that produces carbon dioxide (as bait) through a photo-catalytic reaction, the

Mosclean is said to attract and kill three times more mosquitoes than

conventional traps in lab tests.
