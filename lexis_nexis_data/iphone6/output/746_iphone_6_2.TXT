Apple received more than four million preorders for its new iPhones during the

first 24 hours that they were available, the company announced Monday.



Apple shed some light on advanced sales of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which

are equipped with larger screens. The devices will begin arriving at customers'

doors on Friday, but Apple acknowledged that many will have to wait until

October. The phones will also be available in retail stores starting Friday.



"iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are better in every way, and we are thrilled

customers love them as much as we do," Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.

"We can't wait to get our best iPhones yet into the hands of customers starting

this Friday."



Analysts predicted that customers would rush to get their hands on the iPhone 6

and iPhone 6 Plus, which have screens of 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively. The

phones also come with better cameras, improved battery life and access to Apple

Pay, a new mobile payments system.
