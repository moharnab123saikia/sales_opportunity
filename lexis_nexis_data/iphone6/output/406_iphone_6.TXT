KATHMANDU, Dec. 13 -- Generation Next Communications (GENXT) has been approved

by Apple Inc to sell its iPhone series in Nepal as the authorised distributor,

the company said. It added that the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus would be

unveiled in the domestic market next week.Although Apple has been selling its

products like the iMac, iPod and MacBooks through various authorised resellers

in Nepal, it has not appointed any authorised distributor for the iPhone.



"Nepali customers will be able to buy the latest series of the iPhone 6 along

with previous models through our sales and distribution network in the country

probably from next Friday," said Pawan Kumar Bhimsariya, managing director of

Generation Next, confirming that his company had been appointed as the

authorised distributor for the iPhone in Nepal.



"Due to lack of authorised sales and service centres, customers have been facing

various problems related to after sales service, but now they can be assured of

the products they buy as we will provide a one-year warranty and VAT bill," said

Bhimsariya.



Although the company didn't disclose the price of the iPhone series, Bhimsariya

said that the rates would be lower than what customers had been paying in the

grey market. Local vendors have been selling the iPhone at a starting price of

Rs 85,000.



Officially launched in September in various international markets, the iPhone 6

and the iPhone 6 Plus are Apple's latest and thinnest smartphones that come in

4.7 and 5.5 inch display. The iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus are thinner at 6.8 mm and

7.1 mm respectively. Both the phones are powered by a new A8 processor and sport

an 8 MP iSight camera along with a 1.2 MP front facing camera.



Both the phones support 2G, 3G and 4G network. These phones will be available in

16, 32, 64 and 128 GB capacities and three colour options, grey, silver and

gold, said Bhimsariya. The phones come with features like shatter-proof glass,

fingerprint sensor, active noise cancellation with dedicated mic, face

detection, iCloud service, iMessage, document viewer and editor and Maps, among

others.



Bhimsariya said that they were planning to launch EMI and bundling service with

telecommunication service provider Ncell. According to Bhimsariya, there will be

24 retail stores including three showrooms of Evo Store and Future World along

with 18 Ncell centres. "We have asked Apple to open another seven to eight

retail stores, but it has not confirmed anything yet," added Bhimsariya.
