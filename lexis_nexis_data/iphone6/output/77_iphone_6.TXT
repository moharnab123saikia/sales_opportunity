With the launch iPhone 5S and 5C last year and later Iphone 6 and 6 Plus this

year, Apple indeed is considering India as one of its important markets. The

company is expected to 'very soon' launch zero down payment scheme on the new

Iphone 6.



The official Apple page about where to buy an iPhone 6 today, a link has been

given that points to the Reliance online store page. Though the Reliance page is

yet to list iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, this link indicates that the new iPhones

are soon coming to India bundled with zero down payment option.



According to leaked information on the tariff plans of the iPhones under the

plan, the iPhone 6 could start at INR 3,099 per month for 24 months and the

iPhone 6 Plus could start at INR 3,599 per month for 24 months (via Firstpost).



Note that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were launched in India at INR 53,500 for the

16GB model and INR 62,500 for the 16GB model, respectively.



Last year too, the Cupertino giant partnered with Reliance and Airtel to offer

iPhone 5S and 5C at lower costs, prices starting as low as zero. Partnering with

Reliance for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, thus, does not comes as a surprise.
