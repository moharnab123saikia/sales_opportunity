INVESTOR'S BUSINESS DAILY



Apple late Tuesday beat Wall Street's earnings and sales targets as China

revenue nearly doubled. The iPhone maker gave conservative revenue guidance, as

usual, but it was only slightly below what analysts expected.



Apple earned $1.96 a share on sales of $51.5 billion, for the fiscal fourth

quarter ended Sept. 26. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Apple to

earn $1.88 a share on sales of $51.1 billion. On a year-over-year basis,

earnings per share were up 38%, and sales were up 22%. Those were the smallest

gains in a year.



No China Slowdown



Apple got a big boost from Greater China where its sales rose 99% year over year

to $12.5 billion, helped by strong iPhone demand. CEO Tim Cook said Apple is

seeing no signs of a slowdown in China.



Meanwhile in the Americas, sales rose 10% to $21.77 billion.



Apple stock climbed as much as 3% in late trading, but reversed to fall a

fraction. During the regular session, shares fell 0.6% to 114.55.



Through Tuesday's close, Apple stock is up 3.8% year to date. But it's down from

its 2015 high of 134.54 reached on April 28.



Apple's gross profit margin was 39.9%, which came in above the 39% expected by

Wall Street.



It sold 48 million iPhones last quarter, in line with estimates.



For the December quarter, Apple projected sales of $75.5 billion to $77.5

billion, or $76.5 billion at the midpoint. It forecast a gross profit margin of

39%-40%.



Wall Street had been modeling for EPS of $3.22 a share, up 5%, on sales of

$77.17 billion, up 3%.



"Given the negative expectations, we think their December quarter guide, which

implies about 3% year-over-year revenue growth, will be perceived positively

given rather difficult compares they had," RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit

Daryanani said in a note.



Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said Apple's fiscal Q1 guidance provides a

"healthy" outlook, noting the company's "trademark conservatism."



First iPhone Sales Drop?



Investors have been worried about the December quarter because it faces tough

comparisons to last year's monster iPhone 6 upgrade cycle. The iPhone 6

unleashed a wave of pent-up demand for larger-screen iPhones. If the iPhone 6 S

underperforms, it could lead to the first year-over-year decline in iPhone unit

sales.



Wall Street has been modeling for about 75 million iPhone units to be sold in

the holiday quarter vs. a 74.5 million a year earlier.



Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said Apple's guidance seems to imply

"flattish" iPhone sales of 74 million to 76 million units.



"We view this as a relief given investors were bracing for the start of the 6 S

cycle to be down meaningfully (down 5% to 8%)," he said in a report.



Apple's Q4 results includes just two days of sales of the iPhone 6 S and 6 S

Plus handsets. Apple started selling the iPhone 6 S phones in 12 markets,

including the U.S. and China, on Sept. 25. It opened preorders for the

ninth-generation iPhone on Sept. 12.



The iPhone 6 S phones feature a pressure-sensitive display, a faster processor,

improved cameras and the Live Photos feature that adds motion to still pictures.



The iPhone accounted for 62.5% of Apple's Q4 revenue.



The No. 2 business is Mac computers, accounting for 13.4% of sales. Apple sold

5.7 million Macs, up 3% vs. a year earlier.



But iPad sales dived 20% to 9.9 million, the lowest since 2011.



FBR analyst Daniel Ives described the fiscal Q4 report as "better than feared."



"The Street was fearing a soft guidance and instead got a good December outlook,

which should help turn the tide positive heading into 2016," he wrote in a note.
