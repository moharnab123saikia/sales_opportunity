Riverside, CA,  June 03, 2016 --(PR.com)-- EMPIRE Cell Phone Accessories is

proud to announce the launch of its newest phone case series, the MPERO SLIM

SHOCK Flexible Bumper Protection Case Series for the iPhone 6/6s, iPhone 6

Plus/6S Plus, and iPhone SE. Available in time for Father's Day, this new phone

case series is available today online and in their Riverside, CA Retail

Showroom.



This phone case may be slim, but it was made for protection. On the interior of

the SLIM SHOCK, there are hundreds of circular shock absorbing spacers that

create a cushion of air for an additional layer of protection. The corners of

phones are extremely vulnerable, and easily broken upon impact, that's why the

SLIM SHOCK is designed with bumpers around the edges to prevent serious damage

from clumsy drops or accidental falls. The ribbed sides of the case are

ergonomically designed for a comfortable grip. The case comes in clear, as well

as translucent tints of gold and pink for those who want to add a hint of color.



The MPERO SLIM SHOCK Series case for the iPhone 6/6S, iPhone 6 Plus/6S Plus, and

iPhone SE are available today on empirecase.com for $8.99 each. Additional MPERO

SLIM SHOCK Series cases are available for Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S7

Edge, Samsung Galaxy Note 5, Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime, and Samsung Galaxy J1

(2016).
