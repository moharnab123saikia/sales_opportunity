India, Nov. 25 -- Shares of Apple Inc gained almost 2 per cent after

Susquehanna's analyst raised their priced target to USD 135 from USD 120, citing

improvement in the iPhone 6 plus product mix.



Susquehanna Financial Group analysts said on Monday, "Our recent checks suggest

iPhone production of 60-65 mn for Q4, consistent with our prior expectations.

Apple is producing as much of the iPhone 6 Plus as they can and we view the mix

of iPhone 6 Plus to be a very important driver of Apple's profitability, since

the profitability of the 6 Plus is so much higher than iPhone 6."



Susquehanna added that Apple is making as many iPhone 6 Plus as it can but the "

iPhone demand is still exceeding supply."
