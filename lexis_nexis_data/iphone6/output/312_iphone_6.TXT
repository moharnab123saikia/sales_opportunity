Today: Apple shows off a new product, but the refreshed iPhone line will mean

more to the company's bottom line. Also: Intel shows off its next advances.



The Lead: iPhones are key to Apple revenue growth, Apple Watch adoption



Apple's debut event sparked a lot of talk about its smartwatch, the first new

device launched by the company since the iPad four years ago, but the company's

immediate future and the Apple Watch's success depend on the other gadgets

introduced Tuesday -- new iPhones.



In a highly anticipated event Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook debuted the Apple

Watch and a mobile-payments attempt called Apple Pay, two new offerings the

Cupertino company hopes will grow revenues that have already exploded in the

past decade. The main cause of that growth has been the iPhone, Apple's

smartphone that was refreshed with two new offerings, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6

Plus.



The main focus was Apple Watch, a smartwatch that will work in concert with the

iPhone as long as the device is an iPhone 5 or newer. The device has a starting

price of $350 and offers an array of customizable features, with early reviews

proclaiming it the best smartwatch to arrive so far.



However, Apple will have to sell a lot of smartwatches to recognize a

substantial amount of revenues, and it won't be helped by the holiday shopping

season since the watch will not hit shelves until 2015.



The most optimistic forecast for watch sales that arrived ahead of the debut --

Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty's prediction that Apple would sell up to 60

million smartwatches in the first year -- would add more than 10 percent to

Apple's revenue total, but that's a very tall order. Bloomberg News points out

that only 2.8 million smartwatches were sold in 2013 , along with 13.6 million

fitness-tracking devices.



"If you believe in having a screen on your wrist, then this is the way to do it,

but the question is whether this is something people want," Andreessen Horowitz

partner Benedict Evans told Bloomberg.



However, the Apple Watch as well as Apple Pay could be helped by Apple's big

moneymaker, the iPhone, which makes up the majority of Apple sales and profits.

Apple introduced two larger iPhones on Tuesday, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus,

with the latter phone of the "phablet" variety, offering a 5.5 inch screen

between the typical dimensions of smartphones and tablets.



The larger screen is an important feature for Apple's growth in Asia, where the

phablet form factor has been extremely popular. Research firm IDC reported last

week that phablets will surpass laptops in 2014 and tablets in 2015 in terms of

shipment volume, underscoring the battle Apple is set to enter.



"That's a slam dunk," TECHnalysis Research analyst Bob O'Donnell told Mercury

News reporter Julia Love . "Most of the people things are doing with their

phones today really cry out for a larger screen."



Along with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Apple will continue to sell the

iPhone 5S and 5C at reduced prices, giving it a wider range of sizes and price

points that will be crucial as the company seeks further sales growth.



In return, iPhone adoption could lead to greater adoption of the new offerings

Apple introduced Tuesday.



"The iPhone acts as a critical bridgehead to acquire new customers, and as a

foundation for new ventures such as Apple Watch and Apple Pay," IHS analyst Ian

Fogg noted in an email Tuesday. "The more new customers Apple can win with the

iPhone 6, the greater the chance of success the company will have with Apple

Watch and Apple Pay."



Apple's stock fluctuated wildly during the event, though the general pattern

told the story: prices went higher while the iPhone was being discussed, then

fell when the Apple Watch made its debut. In the end, Apple topped $103 in

intraday trading but ended with a 0.4 percent decline at $97.99.



SV150 market report: Wall Street falls as Intel pitches its future



Apple's struggles contributed to a tough day on Wall Street , especially for

Silicon Valley tech stocks, which were also brought down by Intel and Google.



Intel couldn't find a boost despite showing off its next round of advances in a

Tuesday event at its Santa Clara headquarters. The chipmaker's annual event for

software developers focused mostly on Intel's attempts to break into wearables

and the so-called Internet of Things, while also including an ultrathin tablet

and wireless-charging technology. "My biggest take-away (was) just how serious

Intel is about mobility and the Internet of Things," analyst Patrick Moorhead

told the Mercury News. Intel shares fell 1.2 percent to $34.91 on the day.



Google continued to deal with issues in Europe, as the Mountain View search

giant's antitrust deal seemingly fell apart and former CEO Eric Schmidt looked

for clarification on the "Right to be Forgotten" ; Google declined 1.6 percent

to $591.97 on the day. Twitter fell 2.7 percent to $50.61 while facing threats

from a terrorist organization, and rival Facebook dropped 1.6 percent from

all-time highs to close at $76.67. As Apple broke into PayPal's payments

territory, parent company eBay sank 2.8 percent to $52.73. The Bay Area's merger

market stayed hot, with eBates getting $1 billion from Rakuten a day after

Berkeley organic foods company Annie's agreed to be purchased for $820 million .

After the bell, Palo Alto Networks released its earnings , showing a quarterly

loss of $32.1 million or 41 cents a share, on sales of $178.2 million,

exhibiting year-over-year revenue growth of 59 percent; shares gained to nearly

$93 in late trading after closing with a 0.8 percent decline at $89.28.
