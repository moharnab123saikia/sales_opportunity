Cupertino-based Apple tumbled on Tuesday after an unsettling report from Wall

Street analyst Credit Suisse that suggested sales of tech giantcs iPhone 6

devices may be struggling.



cApple has lowered its component orders by as much as 10 percent, according to

our teams in Asia,c a team led by Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote

in a research note on Tuesday.ccThe cuts seem to be driven by weak demand for

the new iPhone 6s.c



Overall builds for the iPhone 6 are now estimated to be below 80 million units

for the three months that will end in December and between 45 million to 50

million units for the quarter that will end in March 2016.



In addition, the analysts lowered their projections for calendar 2016 unit

builds for the iPhone 6 to 222 million units, down from the prior estimate of

242 million units. That would be 8.3 percent below the original estimate for

2016.



Credit Suisse also estimated that 2017 will bring iPhone build to 235 million

units, which would be 6 percent higher than the new 2016 prediction.



cIn our view, the continued weak supply chain news could weigh on Apple shares

for the next few weeks or quarters,c Credit Suisse stated in the note.



For all of calendar 2016, Apple should earn about $9.81 a share, which is about

6 percent below the prior estimate of $10.40, the analysts predicted.



The investment firm maintained an out-perform rating on Apple, despite the

concerns raised by the potential slowdown in iPhone sales.



Among the reasons for future growth: Credit Suisse believes the installed base

for the iPhone will swell to 615 million over time, driven by its recent

expansion, which currently is growing by 24 percent a year. Plus, recently

launched installment plans to pay for the iPhone will drive unit sales long

term, the analysts stated.



cIt is tempting to argue that this is now the beginning of the end of the iPhone

businessc growth phase run. Indeed, with revenues now at around $155 billion, it

has clearly been a successful run. Despite this, we believe there is more to

come,c Credit Suisse wrote in the note.
