

Sept. 20--Dozens of people lined up for the new iPhone 6 Friday.

AT&T unveiled what some consider the biggest advancement in iPhone history.
Customers started camping out at the store in The Shoppes at North Village
shortly after 10 p.m. Thursday. The store opened at 8 a.m. Friday.

"We knew we were in for a big day when, last Friday, that was the first day for
presale orders, and we set a record for iPhones on any single day," said Michael
Chambers, regional director of external affairs for AT&T. "And that was the
first day it was available."

The company released two models of the newest phone. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6
Plus, which includes iOS 8, feature 4.7- and 5.5-inch displays with innovative
technology. Apple designed the new phones with advanced iSight and FaceTime HD
cameras, advanced speed and efficient wireless technologies and Apple pay.

It was all too tempting for Emily Hendricks. She and her mother got in line
outside the store at The Shoppes at around 5 a.m.

"She's a die-hard Apple fanatic," Ms. Hendricks said of her mother. "I have to
admit, I love the phones, too. I just like the simplicity of them and
everything."

AT&T would not disclose how much inventory their stores will have, but Mr.
Chambers said he anticipated the North Shoppes location would sell out by noon
on Friday.
