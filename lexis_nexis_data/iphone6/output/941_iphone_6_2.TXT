PESHAWAR, Nov. 30 -- Telecommunication service provider Ufone in partnership

with Apple announced on Friday the launch of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in

Pakistan.



The popular smartphones will be made available to consumers under the banner of

the telecom service provider from Dec 11 this year.



Customers will be able to register online for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus from

Nov 28 at the company's website, a press statement said.

telecommunication provider for the launch of its signature smartphone.

is widely believed to be the world's second-largest information technology

company.



Despite the phone's official unavailability in the country, iPhone enjoys a

large fan base in Pakistan, with many users already awaiting the entry of the

new product.
