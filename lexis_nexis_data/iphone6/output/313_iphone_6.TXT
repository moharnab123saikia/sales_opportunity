Apple's[ticker symb=AAPL] lower-cost iPhone SE was meant to expand the company's

market reach to more price-sensitive consumers, but the cheaper handset is

taking away sales from higher-priced iPhones, a report out Wednesday indicates.



Many owners of older-model iPhones are upgrading to the iPhone SE rather than

the iPhone 6 and 6S series handsets, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners

said.



IBD'S TAKE: Apple has an IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of just 19, meaning

it has been outperformed by 81% of stocks in the last 12 months. More

information on Apple stock is available at the IBD Stock Checkup.



In the second quarter, the new iPhone SE accounted for 16% of total U.S. iPhone

sales, with the iPhone 6S at 39% and iPhone 6S Plus at 26%, CIRP said.



"In this quarter, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus accounted for 65% of total sales,"

said Josh Lowitz, CIRP partner and co-founder. "In contrast, a year ago, in the

June 2015 quarter, their predecessors, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, had 82% of total

sales."



A year ago, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus grew their share of total U.S. iPhone sales

relative to the previous quarter, up from 78% in the March 2015 quarter. But in

this year's June quarter, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus saw their share shrink

relative to the March 2016 quarter, to 65% from 71%.



CIRP blamed the iPhone SE for taking away sales of the flagship models.



Apple launched the iPhone SE, which starts at $399, on March 31.



Apple stock rose 0.9% to 99.96Â in the stock market today, the third straight day

that it hit or topped 100 intraday but closed below that level. The shares are

down 5% so far in 2016.
