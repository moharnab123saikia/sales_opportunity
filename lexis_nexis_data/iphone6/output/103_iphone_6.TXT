The finished Apple Inc. iPhone 6 will most likely look different, but it's

interesting to see how Smart Bezel could work.



Apple used to be the clear smartphone leader with its iconic iPhone series

thanks to a combination of outstanding hardware and software to match. Now,

Android-based phones are arguably as good, if not better, with the likes of the

HTC One, Sony Xperia Z and Samsung Galaxy S4, not necessarily in that order,

giving the once-unmatchable Apple a run for its money.



Apple, needless to say, is not sitting back on its haunches, and promises a

rivetting fightback with products that promise the moon.



The current position in the fight revolves around the smashing hit that Samsung

Galaxy S4 has become and everyone is waiting for what Apple will do to its next

in line smartphone - the so-called iPhone 6. Here is a peak at the dates and the

direction Apple may well have taken to beat rivals.



While the new model is being referred to as iPhone 6, it had briefly surfaced

some time ago as the iPhone Math - the screen is reportedly 4.8 inches. Also,

with HTC One having come up with an outstanding camera, iPhone too is playing

catch up and is reportedly targetting trotting out a special one of its own.



iPHONE 6 RELEASE DATE



The glimpse into the working of Apple Inc was given by Citi Research analyst

Glen Yeung who revealed that a 'big-screen iPhone 6' is likely to be launched in

first quarter of 2014.



iPHONE 6 SCREEN



Apple has been known for its high quality screens and it's going to be

interesting to see what it can do with the iPhone 6. According to Apple's

definition of a Retina display, it's one where you can't see the individual

pixels when used at a normal distance. In practice, by Apple's definition, it

means upping the resolution on a Retina screen is pointless. That doesn't mean

that Apple won't simply increase resolution to Full HD, in order to keep up with

the competition, but moving to a larger screen to justify more resolution makes

more sense.



Currently doing the rounds are the rumours that the iPhone 6 will have a

4.8-inch screen, which would make the phone similar in size to the Samsung

Galaxy S4 and the HTC One. At this screen resolution, Apple could then move to a

Full HD (1,920 x 1,080 resolution) or even go beyond.



iPHONE 6 STORAGE



In terms of storage, 64GB has been the top model for a couple of years, so we'd

expect the top model to now be 128GB. We know that Apple now has that capacity,

thanks to the recent launch of a 128GB iPad 4.



iPHONE 6 PROCESSOR



Judging what Apple will do with the processor is harder, but we'd expect an

updated model in the iPhone 6. Currently, the iPhone 5 has a dual-core Apple A6

processor, but a quad-core Apple A7, using ARM Cortex A15-based cores, sounds

plausible to us.



The latest information suggests that the Apple A7 processor is now being

finished by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing company. Recent rumours have

suggested that the iPhone 6 processor will be manufactured by Intel, rather than

Samsung.



iPHONE 6 SMART BEZEL



One of the things that attracts people to the iPhone is its ease of use and

simplicity. However, iOS has barely changed since launch, so Apple could well

introduce new ways to interact with its phones in order to stay ahead of the

competition.



Patently Apple managed to dig up information on a new patent for a smart bezel.

This will use a secondary display system, which could be embedded around the

primary screen or even on the back of a device to provide new controls that

light up when needed.



iPHONE 6 CAMERA



One of the most important part of any smartphone is the camera, with people

generally preferring their phone over a compact camera. With the competition

putting a lot of effort into the quality of their cameras, Apple has slightly

fallen behind, with the iPhone 5's quality not matching that of the Samsung

Galaxy S4 or HTC One. Rumours also have it that the iPhone 6 may even get a

12-megapixel sensor, up from the 8-megapixel version on the iPhone 5.



Upping the sensor resolution can introduce problems with noise, though, as

there's less light per pixel. Apple will be keen to counteract problems like

this, so a lens with a faster aperture would make sense. Currently the iPhone 5

has an f2.4 lens, but an f2.2 or f2.0 lens would mean better low-light

photography.



iPHONE 6 PRICE



Apple typically, releases its new models at the same price as the old ones, and

we can't see it introducing a more expensive phone into this tough market. If

that holds out, then, and assuming that the 16GB model is dropped, we'd expect

the 32GB model to cost 529 (Rs 45,660), the 64GB model 599 (Rs 51,704) and the

128GB model 699 (Rs 60,335).



iOS 7



Apple is all set to unveil the new version of its mobile operating system, named

iOS 7, and has already put up banners with the number '7' at the venue.



Although incredibly innovative and easy to use when it was first launched, iOS

is now looking a bit outdated. Each update to iOS has felt like a tweak, leaving

the user interface static. Some would argue that iOS 6, which was introduced

with the iPhone 5, was actually a step backwards with Apple Maps proving to be

far worse than the Google Maps app it sought to replace.



While iOS has stood roughly still, Android has dramatically improved, providing

widgets to display information on homescreen. Windows Phone 8 has a cleaner

interface, with Live Tiles giving you up-to-date information from your apps,

even though user reaction has often been mixed.



HERE AND NOW



However, the iPhone 6 is still in the nebulous future, 6 months is equal to a

generation these days, and what the company is working on for the launch in the

near future includes the iPhone 5S - it is two to four weeks behind schedule,

says report. Yeung writes that while this will not affect the launch date of the

model, it will result in supply shortage for the model in September.



While Citi Research does not expect many hardware announcements at WWDC 2013,

speculation is rife that Apple will launch the iPhone 5S and a cheaper iPhone at

the event, with launch date rumoured as being June 20, 2013.
