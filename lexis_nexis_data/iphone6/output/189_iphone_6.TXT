Apple prides itself for breaking new ground, but the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6

Plus it introduced Tuesday imitates its competitors, mostly Samsung, by offering

bigger phones.



The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen. The iPhone 6 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen. The

older iPhone models isc4 inches on the diagonal. Samsungcs Galaxy is 5.7 inches.



Images of the new phones flashed behind Tim Cook, Applecs CEO, with the slogan,

cBigger than bigger.cc



Why make the switch? Some customers told that they found a bigger screen more

useful. c



Part of the reason Samsung went the route of bigger screens is because many

Asian customers often do not have home computers, relying on their phones for

their computing and Internet access. There is greater demand for the cphabletc

market, says The Guardian.



But Apple has followed others before only to completely outpace them. Think what

happened with the iPod and the MP3 players. Keeping with Applecs aesthetic, the

new iPhones are thinner.
