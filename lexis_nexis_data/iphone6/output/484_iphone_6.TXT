IPhone 6 Sales Delayed in Big China Market

BEIJING -- Apple is facing a potential setback in China, one of its biggest and

fastest-growing markets, after the much-anticipated introductions here of the

new iPhone models were delayed.



On Wednesday, Apple told China's three big state-owned mobile service providers

that it would not release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in mainland China on

Sept. 19, when sales start elsewhere. The carriers had already booked

advertising campaigns for the phones.



The move set off consternation among Apple's partners in China, as well as with

consumers who had been eagerly awaiting the introductions. Apple did not explain

the delay, executives at the carriers said, but it appeared the phones had not

received approval from Chinese regulators to go on sale.



The Chinese leadership and the state-controlled news media grew wary of foreign

technology providers after revelations last year by Edward J. Snowden of

American cyberspying. In July, CCTV, the main state-controlled television

network, broadcast a report saying that the iPhone could represent a threat to

China's national security. The accusations were promptly rejected by Apple.



Apple's staff in China appeared to have been caught off-guard by the last-minute

change of plans, with one executive saying on Wednesday that all of the

company's stores in Beijing and Shanghai had been preparing for sales to begin

on Sept. 19. The executive spoke on the condition of anonymity.



Representatives of Apple told the Chinese mobile carriers only that ''there are

some details which are not ready,'' according to a sales manager at China

Telecom, who declined to be named. ''Apple completely let us down without prior

notice,'' the manager added.



Apple declined to comment on Wednesday, as did representatives for China's three

main mobile carriers, which also include China Mobile and China Unicom. Apple's

Chinese website carried a statement saying only that the date of the iPhone 6's

availability would ''be updated soon.''



News reports in China on Wednesday said the iPhone 6 had not yet been approved

by the Ministry for Industry and Information Technology, which must sign off on

the technology of devices like smartphones. No approval for the iPhone 6 could

be found on the regulator's website on Wednesday.



Initially, Apple tended to release new iPhones in the China market many months

after they had been released elsewhere. That changed last year, when Apple

started sales of the iPhone 5S and 5C models in China on Sept. 20, the same day

as in the United States and other major markets.



In January, Apple began selling iPhones through China Mobile, the country's

dominant mobile carrier. It had previously reached sales agreements with the

country's other two biggest carriers.



Greater China -- including the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan -- is Apple's

fastest-growing major market and is the company's third-biggest globally, after

the Americas and Europe. Apple reported sales of $5.9 billion in greater China

from April to June, a 28 percent increase from the same period a year earlier.

By contrast, sales in other regions grew 1 to 6 percent. Greater China accounted

for 16 percent of Apple's total revenue in the three-month period, up from 13

percent a year earlier.



Apple was quick to respond when it was singled out by the CCTV report in July,

which said an iPhone function that allowed a user's location to be tracked could

put state secrets at risk.



''We appreciate CCTV's effort to help educate customers on a topic we think is

very important,'' Apple said in a statement responding to the report, rejecting

accusations that the company tracks users' locations. ''We want to make sure all

of our customers in China are clear about what we do and we don't do when it

comes to privacy and your personal data.''



''Apple has never worked with any government agency from any country to create a

back door in any of our products or services,'' the statement said. ''We have

also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will. It's something we

feel very strongly about.''
