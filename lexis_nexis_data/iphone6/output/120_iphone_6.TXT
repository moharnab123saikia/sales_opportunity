More leaks have confirmed the size and battery capacity of the upcoming iPhone

6.



Apple Daily has leaked images that clearly show two versions of the iPhone 6 and

according to them, the 5.5 inch model will be called "iPhone 6L" and has a

massive 2,915 mAh battery capacity. The smaller 4.7 inch iPhone will be called

iPhone 6 and run with a 1810mAh battery . The leaked screenshots also show

different tints on the screen perhaps giving credence to the claim that the

larger model may sport the sapphire based glass screen.



It's not been confirmed yet if both the devices will have different processors

or at least different variants of the A8 processor but it does confirm that the

phones are designed differently on the exterior.
