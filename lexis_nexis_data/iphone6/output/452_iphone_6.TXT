this year. The company last year launched one iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C (after
iPhone 5 in 2012) together, and could be going ahead establishing a new trend
for itself.

According to a report published in Techradar, (from Nikkei Japan) the Cupertino
company could bring the next iPhone in two sizes of 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch.

According to this news mass production of LCD display panels will start in Q2.
LG could also manufacture chips for LCD displays and fingerprint scanner. The
display could be higher than the current models.

A report published in Digitimes recently mentioned that "Foxconn Electronics is
expected to land orders for 90 million units of the iPhone 6 from Apple in 2014,
the Chinese-language Commercial Times cited data from Citigroup Global Markets
as indicating." Read- Apple iPhone 6 to launch in festive season this year, 90

This bit of information reveals quite a lot about the new models. These will
sport lcd panels, which mean they would be flat like the previous iPhone models.
The company will not release a flexible iPhone this year. Another important
thing is that the models will carry a fingerprint scanner, which we expected
will form a part of the upcoming ipHone models.

Also note that the display could be the Retina 2 type that might go for a
competition with the 2K display in Android phones.

The iPhone 6 is expected to launch this year during the year end festive season
in September/October.
