Apple plans iPad event on Oct. 16: report

On the heels of a major launch of large-screen iPhones, Apple has scheduled an

October 16 event to update its iPad line, technology news website Re/code

reported Friday.



The event also will include a look at next-generation software for powering

Macintosh computers, Re/code said, citing unnamed sources.



The gathering is to take place in an auditorium at Apple's headquarters in the

California city of Cupertino, according to the report.



Apple did not reply to an AFP request for comment.



If the report is on target, the iPad event will take place a day before Apple

begins selling its latest iPhones in China.



Apple launched the large-screen iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on September 19 and

has rolled the smartphones out to an array of countries, but not China where it

took some time to clear licensing hurdles.



Apple's revenue in Greater China -- which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan -- is

second only to the United States, and chief executive Tim Cook has said he

expects it to become the company's biggest market in time.



Apple, which popularized tablets with its iPad, remained the largest single

global vendor in the second quarter but its market share fell to 26.9 percent

from 33 percent last year, as Android makers boosted their share, according to

the research firm IDC.



- iPhone 6 sales soar -



The first day of global sales for the phones was a huge success, with Apple

breaking its sales record for an opening weekend of a new iPhone model,

delivering 10 million in three days and boasting it could have sold more if it

had them.



Both new iPhones have larger screens as Apple catches up with the "phablet"

trend pioneered by competitors such as Samsung, which has had success with its

Galaxy Note series.



The iPhone 6 has a screen of 4.7 inches and the 6 Plus is 5.5 inches, reflecting

a growing preference for big screens on smartphones.



Main rival Samsung has long had a range of larger handsets, which are popular in

Asia.



Apple made a rare apology last week for a software bug in a freshly released

version of iOS mobile operating system that saw iPhone users lose service, and

sought to quell a storm over reports that its new handsets are susceptible to

bending.



Apple downplayed reports on bending of its newly released oversize iPhone -- one

analyst described the damaging claims as "a black eye" for Apple --- saying it

had only received nine complaints about the matter.



The statement said that "with normal use a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and

through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted

Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus."



Apple released fully updated iOS 8.0.2 software to fix trouble with the original

version of the mobile operating system for its gadgets.
