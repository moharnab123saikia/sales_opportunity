Apple will sell its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in China this month after

agreeing to improve user security and privacy.



Apple will sell its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in China this month after

agreeing to improve user security and privacy.



The devices will go on sale on Oct 17, the company said after China's Ministry

of Industry and Information Technology granted the smartphones a network access

permit, the final step in the approval process. Pre-orders will start on Oct 10,

and the phones will be available at all three major carriers.



The approval process included discussions on potential leaks of personal data

through weaknesses in Apple's operating system, with the company taking measures

in iOS 8 to eliminate risks stemming from three background diagnostic tools, the

ministry said.



"Apple is coming under greater scrutiny on personal data security from the

government," said Shaun Rein, managing director for China Market Research Group

in Shanghai. "This is definitely starting to affect consumers and some are

thinking twice about buying Apple now because the government has made them

nervous."



Apple pledged it has never built, and will never build, a "back door" with any

government agencies for products or services, the ministry said.



The 16-gigabyte iPhone 6 will retail for 5,288 yuan ($860) and the 16-gigabyte

iPhone 6 Plus for 6,088 yuan, Apple said.



"We are thrilled to bring iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to our customers in China

on all three carriers at launch," Apple CEO Tim Cook said.



The new iPhones will trail the release of Samsung's Note 4 device in China.



Apple released the new iPhones in 10 markets, including the US, Hong Kong, Japan

and Australia, on Sept 19 before adding another 20 countries a week later.



China's consumers typically have waited at least three months for Apple to start

selling new iPhones in the world's biggest smartphone market, triggering a flood

of devices into the country's black market.



Vendors near the Apple store in the Sanlitun district in Beijing are selling the

128-gigabyte iPhone 6 Plus for 12,000 yuan, compared with HK$8,088 ($1,040) in

Hong Kong.
