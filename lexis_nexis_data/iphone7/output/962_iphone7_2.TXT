New York, Oct. 18 -- What if the home button of your new iPhone 7 stops working?
No worries, as Apple's iPhone 7 home button has a virtual alternative that turns
on automatically if the physical button fails to perform.


 According to the Apple-tracking website MacRumors, the virtual home button sits
neatly at the bottom of the iPhone 7's screen.

 With the new iOS 10 in place, the iPhone 7 screen displays a message, saying
that "Home Button may need service and "onscreen Home Button" can be used in the
meantime.

click-mechanism home button in favour of a 'solid-state' pressure sensitive one
