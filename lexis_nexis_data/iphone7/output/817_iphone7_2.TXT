5.5-inch iPhone - iPhone 7 Plus - has drawn attention to a kind of hissing sound
coming from his handset.

The video, posted by Stephen Hackett of the 512 Pixels website to report his
iPhone 7 Plus' hissing fits, shows that the handset starts making snake-like
sounds when Hackett is in the process of restoring the handset from iCloud.

According to Hackett's observation, the hissing noise in his iPhone 7 Plus
appears to be coming from the rear-side of the handset. He speculates that it is
probably the central processing unit which makes the hissing sound.

Hackett also asserts that some other users of the new iPhone 7 Plus handset -
which was launched by Apple along with the iPhone 7 model earlier this month -
have also said that their devices also seemingly have the same issue.

Moreover, some reports from iPhone 7 users on the Twitter site have also
revealed that the handset is apparently affected by the 'hissing sound' problem.
Apple, meanwhile, has refrained from commenting on the issue.
