iPhone 6S due to features such as a bigger battery and larger storage capacity,
according to analysis by IHS Markit.

Including $5 ((EURO)4.49) in basic manufacturing costs, total cost to
manufacture the iPhone 7 mobile rises to $224.80 ((EURO)201), $36.89 higher than
the business research provider's estimates the iPhone 6S.

Apple retails an unsubsidised 32GB iPhone 7 at $649.

The company unveiled the iPhone 7 with high-resolution cameras and no headphone
jack at its annual launch on September 7. IHS Markit also said the iPhone 7's
Bill Of Materials (BOM), a financial estimate of the raw materials used, was "in
line" with flagship smartphones made by rival Samsung but Apple ekes out better
margins.

an "All other things being equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware
than Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past," said Andrew
Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services at IHS Markit. IHS
Markit has not yet performed a teardown analysis on the larger iPhone 7 Plus.

for Supplies of Apple's iPhone 7 Plus have been exhausted in all shades, and the
smaller iPhone 7 has also sold out in the new jet black colour. (Reuters)
