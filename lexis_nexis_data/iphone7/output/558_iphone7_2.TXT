Noted iPhone leaker OnLeaks (aka Steve Hemmerstoffer of Nowhereelse.fr)
published an interesting tweet earlier today indicating that the iPhone 7 may
finally address one of the more longstanding complaints about Apple's iconic
smartphone: battery life. To be clear, Apple has made tremendous improvements in
the iPhone's battery technology over the years, but as we continue to demand
more and more from our smartphones, many people find that they can't even go a
full day on their iPhone with a single charge.

That being the case, OnLeaks's tweet relays that the iPhone 7's battery will
have nearly 15% more capacity than the iPhone 6s battery.

ltrenPretty reliable (not 100% but almost...) source told me #iPhone7 battery =
1960mAh (#iPhone6s = 1715mAh)

This should be encouraging news but we should stress that battery life is
determined by any number of factors. So even though the battery on the iPhone 7
might be able to store more juice, it's entirely possible that new components or
technologies included on the iPhone 7 may demand more power than previous
models. In such a scenario, battery life on the iPhone would more or less remain
the same.

At the same time, with rumors suggesting that the iPhone 7 will be short on
exciting new features, perhaps Apple's key selling points will consist of three
separate factors: improved battery life, more bang for the buck with respect to
storage, and a huge leap forward in camera technology.

One thing is for sure, though. With reports that Apple this past quarter
experienced yet another year-over-year decline in iPhone sales, the iPhone 7
will be released with a whole lot of pressure to succeed right out of the gate.
