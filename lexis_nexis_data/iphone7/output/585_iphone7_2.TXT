Following the release of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus and the news of the new
smaller 4 inch iPhone 5se confirmed, it is now season for the new Apple iPhone 7
rumors and leaks.

Latest leaks and images show the technical drawings for the iPhone 7 chassis.
These images only show the back of the phone, and it looks like the horizontal
antenna lines have been removed, while the lines on the edges remain. Looking at
the images closely also reveals that the camera has changed from the iPhone 6s.
The new camera seems to be significantly larger than the older one, which hints
at a potential upgrade. The new camera also sits closer to the edge of the
phone. However, this may mean that the rumored dual camera system might come
with the iPhone 7 but there are chances it might come for the iPhone 7 Plus.
Since the leak only shows the back of the phone, there is no confirmation
regarding the headphone jack.

A user also went ahead and created a Photoshop mock of what the iPhone 7 might
look like according to the leaked images. These images suggest that the iPhone 7
might have more of a minimalist appearance which does in fact make it more
appealing. According to the source of the leak, the phone also appears to be
slimmer by comparison to other iPhones.

Although these are just rumors, and are to be taken with some skepticism, it is
worth noting that similar images leaked before the iPhone 6 came out, which also
accurately predicted the design of it.
