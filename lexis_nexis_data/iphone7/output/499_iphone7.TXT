 RUMOUR ROUND UP
 Here is the roumour round up of the upcoming iPhone 7:
 A tech site Techtastic has got some good clues about the colour of the Apple
iPhone 7. It says that the iPhone 7 will come in space gray black.
 In other tech rumours, Apple will come with a 32GB storage for the base variant
of its iPhone 7.
 For a very long time Apple users have been complaining about Apple's 16GB
storage which they find too less to capture a high definition video.
 Meanwhile, Apple is likely to carry on with the making of 64GB and 128GB
versions of the phone.
 A July video leak showed iPhone 7 to be is very similar to iPhone 6S in terms
of design and size. The leaked video also suggested that the phone may have a
bigger camera and USB-type C port.
 It may also have sport optical image stabilisation (OIS) feature.
 A Wall Street Journal report said that Apple will come with a 32GB storage for
the base variant of its iPhone 7. Meanwhile, Apple is likely to carry on with
the making of 64GB and 128GB versions of the phone.
 So far, we have known from various reports that the iPhone 7 would not have
antenna bands across the rear and no 3.5mm headphone jack.
