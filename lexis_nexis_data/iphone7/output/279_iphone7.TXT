
DATELINE: Hyderabad


Hyderabad, Sept. 7 -- Before the launch of iPhone 7 today, here are seven things
that you need to know about the newest members of the Apple family.

1.Venue: It's the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco that will be
hosting the grand event. Apparently, the auditorium has been jazzed up for the
biggest smartphone.

2.Chip: Preliminary reports suggest that the iPhone 7 will be powered by Apple's
new A10 chip offering a maximum clock speed of 2.4 GHz.

3.What's out: The tech major is likely to drop 16GB and 64GB models and add a
256GB variant. As a result, Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models will come in
32GB, 128 GB and 256GB variants. Both the iPhones are also likely to get a RAM
boost.

4.Thin is In: If rumours are to be believed, Apple is apparently aiming to make
the iPhone 7 up to 1mm thinner. Tech wizards hint that it will perhaps do away
with the traditional headphone jack. Also, the iPhone 7 may finally reveal the
Apple's rumored wireless "AirPods" earbuds.

5.Water-safe: Dropped your phone into the sink? Chill! The new iPhones will be
water-resistant.

6.Picture-Perfect: There have not been too many complaints about the iPhone 6
camera. But things may get better with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Both
cameras will have 12-megapixel sensors.

7.Desi love: The good news is that we can expect the company to launch the
device in India before Diwali. This means you have to re-budget your Diwali
expenses.

All of the above information is speculative as nothing has been revealed
officially about the iPhone 7 by Apple so far.
