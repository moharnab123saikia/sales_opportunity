New Delhi, July 15 -- Zee Media Bureau
 Apple's much talked about new device, the iPhone 7 is likely to launched in the
month of September as was with other iPhones in the past.


 And while it is about two months away from the rumoured launch date of the new
iPhones - iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Pro, their prices have been
reportedly leaked on Chinese site Weibo.
 Though the prices on Weibo were listed in Yuan, they approximately convert to
Indian rupee as given below.
 iPhone 7
 32GB model: Rs 52,880
 64GB model: Rs 60,880
 256GB model: Rs 70,880
 iPhone 7 Plus
 32GB model: Rs 60,880
 128GB model: Rs 68,880
 256GB model: Rs 78,880
 iPhone 7 Pro
 32GB model: Rs 70,880
 128GB model: Rs 78,880
 256GB model: Rs 88,880
 From the above, it appears evident and proved that Apple will be doing away
with the 16GB variant of the iPhone.
 But again, it appears that in the iPhone 7 Plus and Pro version, Apple will do
away with the 64GB variant too.
 While these are all rumours and leaks, one will have to wait for launch event
which usually takes place in September.
