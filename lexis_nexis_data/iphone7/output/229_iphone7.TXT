with rumours about the new handset's key features.

One question that many people are asking is what colours the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus
will be available in.

The current iPhone 6s model comes in gold, silver, space grey and rose gold, but
various leaks have pointed to new colours for the iPhone 7.

According to well-connected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, who issued a
new research note on Saturday, the iPhone 7 will come in five colours - silver,
gold, rose gold, "dark black" and "piano black".
