One of the more interesting iPhone 7 rumors suggests that Apple's next-gen
iPhone will come with a 256GB storage options. While 256GB of storage may seem
excessive, it perhaps stands to reason that the iPhone 7 Plus -- on account of
its dual camera system which will take presumably large high-res photos -- will
need more storage than many are anticipating.

That said, an interesting iPhone 7 leak hit the Apple blogosphere earlier today
when a spec sheet purporting to be for the iPhone 7 was posted on the Chinese
microblogging website Weibo. As evidenced via the photo below, a 256GB iPhone 7
Plus model may be announced next week at Apple's special media event.

As for other late-breaking iPhone 7 rumors, there are new rumblings suggesting
that the iPhone 7 will come with a lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter
free of charge. This should prove to be welcome news for users wary of opting
for either an Apple-branded headphone solution or Bluetooth headphones.
