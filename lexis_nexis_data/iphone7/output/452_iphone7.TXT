San Francisco.

iPhone users know September is new iPhone month, and the iPhone 7 was revealed.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus look familiar, but the internals received a big upgrade,
including more storage.

Clumsy users will also be happy Apple made the new phones water-resistant, but a
lot of users are still coming to grips with the removal of the headphone jack in
favor of Bluetooth.

So why should consumers pick up the new iPhone 7? Here are four reasons:

1. Water resistance: Everyone knows someone who has dropped his or her phone
into a pool or even the toilet (Hi, Mom). Apple has finally followed Samsung by
making the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus water- and dust-resistant.

2. Dual lens camera on iPhone 7 Plus: Apple will reward buyers of its largest
and most expensive handset with a dual-lens camera system that boasts a 2x
optical zoom and 10x digital zoom with optical image stabilization and the
ability to capture RAW images.

3. More storage, same price: Apple has finally killed the 16-gigabyte phone. The
entry-level iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have 32 GB of storage, and the top end has been
bumped to 256 GB, which is more than a lot of laptops. Prices start at $650,
same as last year's 6S.

4. Black and blacker: Apple has eliminated Space Gray in favor of black (a matte
black) and Jet Black (a shiny black). In fact, the Jet Black only comes in 128
GB and 256 GB configurations.
