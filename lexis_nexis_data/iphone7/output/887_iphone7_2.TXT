
DATELINE: San Francisco


San Francisco, Sept. 8 -- The iPhone 7 has been revealed in San Francisco at an
Apple event tonight.

Tim Cook the CEO of Apple took to the stage and confirmed that the company is
ditching the headphone socket, meaning users will either have to use wireless
Bluetooth headphones called AirPods to listen to music, or buy a pair of wired
headphones that plug into the Lightning port - currently used for charging.

Apple has finally launched their two flagship phones of the year finally putting
an end to all the boring and repetitive rumours. It was also one of the least
surprising launches ever with all the leaks pretty much spoiling the party for
Apple. Keynote began hilariously with James Cordon doing a mini-Carpool Karaoke
jig featuring Tim Cook and Will Pharrell. In fact that was the most surprising
bit of the event. Meanwhile, here's what you get with the new iPhone 7 and
iPhone 7 Plus-
