Apple is all set to reveal the new iPhone this week, or so we hope, but for now,
we have some more rumors for the iPhone 7.

According to KGI Securities Analyst Ming Chi Kuo, Apple will rock a new Apple
A10 chip on the iPhone 7, which is clocked at 2.4 GHz, making it faster than the
A9 chip.Â There are going to be two new colours, "dark black" and "piano black",
while the classic silver grey look is going to be retired, he says. He also
mentions that the next iPhone will have the same rating as the Apple Watch in
terms of waterproofing, meaning it should be able to last for 30 minutes under 1
meter of water.

Other rumors include the end of the 3.5mm headphone jack, along with the new
dual lens camera for the larger 5.5 inch iPhone 7. The iPhone 7 Plus will also
get 3GB of RAM to help with image processing, while the standard model will get
2GB of RAM. The new iPhone will also ditch 16GB and 64GB options, leaving users
to opt for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. There might also be some minor upgrades too.

We will get to know more about the Apple iPhone 7 this week, as Apple has
announced that there will be an iPhone 7 event on Wednesday.
