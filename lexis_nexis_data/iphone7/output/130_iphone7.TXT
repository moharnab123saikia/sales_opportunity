Keep your expensive iPhone jokes handy as Apple has just unveiled the pricing
details of its latest handsets. The best thing is that the information comes
directly from Apple's official website in India. Apple has also confirmed that
the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be launching in India on October 7. Earlier
today, Apple slashed the the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus prices to make way for
the waterproof iPhone duo.

The iPhone 7 Plus that boasts of a dual camera setup will be available in jet
black, black, silver, gold, and rose gold (pink). Its pricing details are as
follows:

iPhone 7 Plus 32 GB - 72,000

iPhone 7 Plus 128 GB - 82,000

iPhone 7 Plus 256 GB - 92,000 (insert your kidney joke here)

The compact iPhone 7 with a 4.7-inch display comes in same hues as that of its
sibling. Due to the lack of fancy dual-camera setup, the iPhone 7 costs
relatively lesser:

iPhone 7 32 GB - 60,000

iPhone 7 128 GB - 70,000

iPhone 7 256 GB - 80,000
