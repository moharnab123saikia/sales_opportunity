

On Wednesday, a newly-leaked image on Chinese microblogging site Weibo
contradicts the rumors that Apple is probably giving the 3.5mm headphone jack a
miss on its forthcoming next-generation iPhone -- iPhone 7 -- apparently to make
the device thinner than its predecessors.

According to the leaked image on Weibo, the headphone jack will not probably be
discontinued by Apple on the iPhone 7 handset.

The image leaked on Weibo is purportedly that of the Lightning cable assembly
which is allegedly meant for the iPhone 7 handset. In the leaked image, the
headphone jack can be seen on the far left side.

Along with hinting at the headphone jack on iPhone 7, the leaked image of the
handset's Lightning cable assembly - which appears to be different from the same
part used in the iPhone 6S handset - also shows that the mentioned part will
house a number of components including antenna cables and the Lightning port.

Though the authenticity of the image leaked on Weibo has not been confirmed, the
suggestion that iPhone 7 will probably feature a headphone jack is contradictory
to earlier rumors which projected the next-generation iPhone will come without
the headphone jack.
