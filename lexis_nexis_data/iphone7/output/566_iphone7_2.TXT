While news of the iPhone 7 keeps making rounds over the Internet, one rumor that
has been constant is the larger camera for the next iPhone. Also, with September
creeping closer, you can expect a lot more of iPhone 7 rumors.

New leaks of the iPhone 7's camera module show a much larger CMOS sensor for a
new camera, which also hints that the camera is let in a lot of light, thus
performing better in low light. The leaked image for the 4.7inch iPhone 7 shows
a much different camera that the iPhone 7 Plus. This 5.5 inch variant is rumored
to come with a dual lens camera, which also hints at a larger iPhone.

However, since these are just leaks, we still dont know if they are genuine just
yet. However, since they tie in with earlier rumors and come from reliable
sources, they can be believed. Additionally, from what we heard last, the iPhone
7 and Plus, will come with the 3.5mm headphone jack. There are also rumors that
there are three iPhone models this year, which is set to replace the iPhone 6
and maybe even a dual SIM slot. Only time will tell.
