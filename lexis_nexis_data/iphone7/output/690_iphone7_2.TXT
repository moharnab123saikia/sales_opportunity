While the explosion of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is not far behind us, a video of an
iPhone 7 exploding in China surfaced online on Monday, The Paper reports.

In the video, a man from Zhengzhou, central China's Henan province, said that
his rose-gold iPhone 7 suddenly exploded as he was shooting a video with it last
week. The phone exploded into two parts and left his hands swollen and his face
with some injuries.

Unlike the Galaxy Note 7's explosion, which smoked excessively after burning,
this iPhone 7 exploded leaving no burn marks, and the battery remained in good
condition.

Apple China reported the incident to its headquarters, says The Paper.

This is the first known iPhone 7 explosion in China, but it was not an isolated
incident within the world. An iPhone 6 Plus in California, US, exploded with
black smoke as it was charged and the phone was completely, the ABC News
reported.

Earlier this week, an iPhone 6 Plus belonging to Darina Hlavaty, an American
student, burned suddenly during a class, leaving a burnt hole in her jeans.

For now, there is no evidence that these are isolated incidents and will not
happen again. Apple Inc has not disclosed the measures it will take to resolve
this issue.
