At the event held in San Francisco, Apple unveiled two new handsets - The iPhone
7 and iPhone 7 Plus. One of the highlights of today's keynote has been the
dual-camera setup, which comprises of a 12-megapixel snapper and a depth sensor.
This arrangement is quite reminiscent of Huawei's Honor 6 Plus. Such setup
enables you to alter the depth-of-focus of a photograph. Apple has kept this
killer-feature exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus. It is a shame that those who will
purchase the iPhone 7 will have to miss out on this. The new "Quad-LED True
Tone" flash is said to be 50 percent brighter than iPhone 6s. For narcissist
grown-ups, Apple has thrown-in a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera.

The handset features a 5.5-inch IPS display with 1920x1080 pixels. Much like its
younger sibling, the iPhone 7 Plus supports 3D touch. It is powered by the same
Apple A10 Fusion chipset, which powers the iPhone 7. Rest of the features remain
the same, the iPhone 7 Plus is water and dust resistant. It does away with the
3.5 mm jack in favour of lightening port. The home button hosts a pressure
sensitive fingerprint sensor.

The iPhone 7 Plus will be up for pre-order from this Friday in more than 25
countries. It will hit the stores on 16th of September. The handset will be
available in gold, rose gold (pink), silver, and two black options. The 32 GB
base model is pegged at $769 (approx Rs 51,000). The 128 GB version can be yours
for $869 (roughly Rs 58,000), whereas the 256 GB variant will burn a $969 (Rs
65,500) hole in your pocket.
