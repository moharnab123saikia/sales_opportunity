After the success of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, Apple is gearing up for the
release of the iPhone 7, its latest flagship. As usual, the rumor mill has been
busy, and the latest rumor is that the iPhone 7 will look similar to the iPhone
6s, but thinner.

According to a report from KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 7 will be
visually similar to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but it will be 1mm thinner. It
will have the same height and width, and will not be waterproof. For
comparison's sake, the iPhone 6s is currently 7.1mm thin, so if this report is
true, the iPhone 7 will be just 6.1mm thick similar to the iPod touch, which0 is
also 6.1mm thick. The camera at the back will also now be flush with the
device's casing and will not feature the 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead, it might
come with stereo speakers, which should improve sound quality as opposed to the
mono speakers in the earlier iPhones. The iPhone 7 might also come with a
thinner Lightning port than previous iPhones. However, this does not mean that
we will need a new cable or connector, it is just the actual cutout that is made
smaller.

Apple is also working on a revamped, cord free pair of Beats to go along with
the iPhone 7 in lieu of the 3.5mm headphone jack. These headphones will most
likely be sold separately and come with a charging case included.

The iPhone 7 is expected to be unveiled later this year in September.
