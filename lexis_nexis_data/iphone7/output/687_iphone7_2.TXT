

In the aftermath of Samsung Electronics' decision to discontinue sales and
production of the problem-ridden Galaxy Note 7 globally, attention is now
shifting to which alternative smartphones consumers around the world will turn
to instead.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Samsung on Tuesday announced that it is "officially ending the
sales as well as production of the smartphone to ensure consumer safety,"
following multiple incidents in which the exchanged Note 7 devices fitted with
new batteries caught fire due to overheating.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]The South Korean electronics giant also initiated a global
refund and exchange program, including in the US and Korea, in partnership with
local carriers and retail partners. Customers can receive a full refund or
exchange their Note 7 devices with any other smartphone.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]As Samsung pulls the Note 7 from the world's biggest markets
for premium smartphones, rival electronics giants Apple, LG Electronics and
Google are expected to score new purchases from some 2.6 million Galaxy Note 7
owners looking for alternative high-end smartphones.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Apple's newly released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, LG
Electronics' V20 and Google's new premium Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones are
slated to compete for market share in the absence of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Customers who are familiar with Android-based smartphones are
likely to prefer smartphones from Google and LG, while others disappointed with
the Samsung brand could choose to switch to Apple's iOS-based iPhone models.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]At the same time, some users who remain loyal to Samsung may
turn to former Samsung smartphones -- including the Galaxy Note 5 launched last
year or the smaller-sized Galaxy S7 released earlier this year -- or simply wait
for the release of the Galaxy S8 next year.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Last month, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus began sales in more
than 30 countries around the world including the US and China. The two new
iPhone models are slated for release on Oct. 21 in Korea.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]The iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch display while the iPhone 7
Plus comes with a larger 5.5-inch full HD display. Both devices run on the iOS
10 operating system.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Setting itself apart from previous models, the new iPhone 7 and
iPhone 7 Plus do not have earphone sockets, and are instead accompanied by
wireless earphones -- which has driven some customers away from the new iPhones.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Meanwhile, LG Electronics has the 5.7-inch LG V20, co-designed
by LG and Denmark-based luxury stereo brand Bang & Olufsen, boasting high-end
audio and camera features. It runs on the Google Android 7.0 Nougat operating
system and comes with a removable battery. The LG V20 is slated to launch in the
US by Oct. 28. The device is already available in Korea.

ã[#x20ac][#x20ac]Google's 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL are also strong
options favored by Android enthusiasts. The Pixel comes with a 12.3-megapixel
rear camera and a 8-megapixel front-facng selfie camera. It is also the first
phone to officially feature the artificial intelligence software Google
Assistance.

The device is slated for release in the US later this month. Google has yet to
announce a launch date for Korea.
