

After all the recent specifications rested down with the launch of new Apple
devices, a new set of speculations arise!

So far, all speculations about the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, ditching of the
headphone jack, and MacBook's new OLED touch bar have turned out true. But, it
looks like the rumour mill doesn't stop though!

A recent report seems to have claimed that a fresh variant of the recently
launched iPhones would be brought in to the market, with a 'Jet White' color,
according to Gadgets 360.

The report originates from Mac Otakara and claims that the 'Jet White' color
variant will be available in both 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch Plus variant. Adding
further, a concept image that shows iPhone 7 in 'Jet White' color scheme has
also been shared in the same report. However, there seems to be no information
as to when the white variant of iPhone 7 be available in the market.

Though the report by Mac Otakara specifies about the 'Jet White' color variant
of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, we can clearly see a disclaimer that states the
source may not be reliable, which means, it is advised not to trust the latest
rumour with a blind eye.

However, as of now, officially, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus smartphones are
available only in Gold, Silver, Black Matte, and Jet Black color schemes.
