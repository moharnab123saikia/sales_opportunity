expect is to hear it hissing at you.

But that's what some Apple customers are reporting, after getting their hands on
the brand new iPhone 7.

First noticed by Stephen Hackett of 512 Pixels , the iPhone 7 seems to make a
noticeable hissing sound while under heavy load.

Hackett uploaded a video to YouTube with a recording of the sound, which is
similar to that of white noise, or the hiss you get from a poorly connected
speaker.

Hackett's complaints have been corroborated by others, including former Apple PR
person and current TechCrunch writer Darrell Etherington .

Etherington said he noticed the hiss while his iPhone 7 Plus was going through
the setup process.

It's unclear how widespread the issue is, or which components of the phone may
be responsible for the bizarre sound.

Although it sounds similar to a laptop fan, there are no moving parts inside the
iPhone 7 that would be capable of generating this sort of noise.

However, the general consensus is that the hiss is somehow related to Apple's
new A10 Fusion processor, due to the fact that it can only be heard when the
device is under heavy load.

Hackett said AppleCare told him to visit an Apple Store to get the phone
replaced - suggesting it could genuinely be a manufacturing error.

The trouble is, with both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus being in high demand, he will
most likely have to wait several weeks for a replacement.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus went on sale on Friday , September 16, featuring
improved processors, cameras and battery life.

Despite Apple nixing the headphone jack, the early smattering of reviews have
been largely positive.

Demand for the new gadgets appears to be extremely high, with both the new "jet
black" model and the larger iPhone 7 Plus selling out before they even hit the
shelves.
