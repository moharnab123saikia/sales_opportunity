

WITH a longer battery life, water and dust resistance and the fastest chip in a
smartphone, the iPhone 7 is the iPhone I've always wanted.

But not anymore because this is the year that Apple has prompted me to switch
camps.

Despite my long-held opposition to phablet-sized phones, the iPhone 7 Plus makes
an offer that can't be refused.

Undeniably the headline feature in the new iPhone is the camera and,
specifically, the main headline is the dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus. If
you buy the iPhone 7, you're going to be impressed with the 12-megapixel camera
with f/1.8 aperture and 5x digital zoom.

But if you buy an iPhone 7 then you are likely to be jealous of anyone who buys
the iPhone 7 Plus with two 12 megapixel cameras, a f/1.8 wide-angle (equivalent
to 28mm) and f/2.8 telephoto (equivalent to 56mm), and a 10x digital zoom. This
is a game changer when it comes to smartphone photography.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has an IP67 rating, which means it is protected from
immersion in liquid to a depth of 1m for 30 minutes. If you happen to fall in
the pool, or spill a cuppa over your phone, this iPhone will survive. But don't
take it for a swim on purpose and keep it away from salt water.

Apple has made room for optical image stabilisation on the iPhone 7, a bigger
battery and stereo sound but has done so at the cost of the headphone jack. The
iPhone comes with headphones that connect through the Lightning Port and an
adaptor.

Belkin has also released a third-party adaptor.This is a phone that answers many
complaints of the past few years. That doesn't make it revolutionary, but it
does make a better smartphone.
