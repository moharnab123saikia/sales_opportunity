case maker Spigen Korea are expected to benefit from Apple's new iPhone 7 that
was unveiled on Sept. 7 in San Francisco.

"New iPhones have always suffered supply constraints for newly adopted parts in
the early days of launch but for the latest iPhone 7 the overall parts supply is
more stable than previous years," said Lee Seung-hyuk, analyst at Korea
Investment and Securities.

Especially LG Innotek, the sole supplier of dual-lens camera modules, is pinning
high hopes on the new phone launch. Upgraded camera functions powered by the
