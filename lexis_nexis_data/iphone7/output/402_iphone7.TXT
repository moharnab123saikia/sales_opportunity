

Apple's latest smartphone, the iPhone 7, goes on sale alongside a new version of
the Apple Watch today, with smaller queues than previous years expected outside
the tech giant's retail stores.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will both come in two new black finishes and are water
resistant for the first time.

But some industry experts have questioned the need to update to the new device
ahead of a major upgrade expected in the 10th anniversary iPhone due to be
released next year.

However, Apple revealed on Thursday that the iPhone 7 Plus, which comes with
dual rear cameras for the first time, has already sold out in all colours during
the pre-order period, while the polished Jet Black finish iPhone 7 will also not
be available to walk-in customers on launch day.

This announcement is likely to also affect the size of queues outside stores.

"We couldn't be happier with the initial response to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7
Plus, and we are looking forward to beginning sales through our retail stores
and partners around the world," Apple's statement said.

"Beginning Friday, limited quantities of iPhone 7 in silver, gold, rose gold and
black will be available for walk-in customers at Apple retail stores.

"During the online pre-order period, initial quantities of iPhone 7 Plus in all
finishes and iPhone 7 in jet black sold out and will not be available for
walk-in customers."

Upon announcing the new device earlier this month, Apple boss Tim Cook said the
tech giant's aim was to create the "most advanced smartphone" it has ever made.

The iPhone 7 also sees the removal of the device's headphone jack, with users
now needing to connect headsets via the Lightning port, or use wireless
headphones.
