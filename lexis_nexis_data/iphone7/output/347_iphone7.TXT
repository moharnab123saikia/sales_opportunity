certification portal claim to have revealed the RAM capacity of the recently
launched Apple iPhone 7 Plus . According to the reports, the 5.5-inch iPhone 7
Plus has a 3GB of RAM.Apple, for quite a long time, has adopted a different
approach from the competition when it comes to marketing iPhones. This includes
not revealing the RAM capacity of its devices. And this has continued for the
new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, launched earlier this week.

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are powered by the new quad-core Apple A10 Fusion
processor, including two high-performance and two high-efficiency cores. There's
also a hexa-core GPU which the company claims is 50% faster than the Apple A9
processor, used in the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.Both variants are set to go
on sale in India from October 7, 2016. As per the company, the price for the new
smartphones starts at Rs 60,000. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be
available in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and Black colour options. They are
available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage variants. However, Jet Black, a
specific colour variant, only comes in 128GB and 256GB variants. New EarPods
(using Lightning connector) and a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter will also be
included with the new iPhones. These can also be purchased separately for Rs
2,500 and Rs 900 respectively.At its recently concluded iPhone launch event,
Apple also launched its new wireless AirPods. The price for the AirPods starts
at Rs 15,400 and they come bundled with a charging-cum-storage case.
