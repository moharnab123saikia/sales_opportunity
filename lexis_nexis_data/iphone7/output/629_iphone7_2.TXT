

Apple is doing away with the headphone jack on its new iPhone.


The tech giant on Wednesday revealed its latest mobile device, the iPhone 7,
during its semi-annual product event in San Francisco. And, as was expected, the
new phone is missing one standard feature: the headphone jack. Instead, owners
of the new iPhone will need to connect over the lightning connector, the same
port where the iPhone's charger plugs in.


Apple also has introduced a new set of ear buds, called AirPods, that connect
wirelessly and will retail for $160.


Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the iPhone onstage, reminding the audience that
Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones since the device was first introduced
in 2007.


Apple is calling the iPhone 7 a major design change from previous devices. The
newly water-resistant device even comes in a new finish, the high-gloss jet
black.


The iPhone 7 also comes with a new camera that Apple is calling "the best camera
we've ever made." And the larger iPhone 7 Plus will have two megapixel cameras,
one wide angle and one telephoto, that creates a zoom feature built into the
iPhone.


The reveal came during an announcement-heavy presentation from Apple executives
that kicked off with Cook riding shotgun with James Corden for "Carpool
Karaoke." The company also updated the audience on Apple Music, which now has 17
million subscribers, and introduced a waterproof Apple Watch, the Series 2.


The iPhone 7 starts at $649 for 32 gigabytes of storage.
