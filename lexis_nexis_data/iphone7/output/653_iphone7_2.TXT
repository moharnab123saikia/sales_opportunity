
DATELINE: San Francisco


San Francisco, Sept. 8 -- As Apple was gearing up to present its big iPhone 7
announcement at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium here on Wednesday, the company's
reactivated Twitter account, in a series of tweets, sent out photos and video of
the new iPhone 7 and highlighting some of its top features before CEO Tim Cook
could get to it on stage.

"The tweets appear to have been sent out accidentally and Apple pulled them just
a few minutes after they began spreading around but till then, they were
retweeted thousand of times," The Verge reported.

The tweets leaked new colours, water resistance and a dual camera of new iPhone
7.

Apple unveiled its much anticipated stunning iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus along
with next-generation 'Apple Watch Series 2'.

iPhone 7 has water and dust resistance, dual-lens camera (in iPhone 7 Plus),
4.6-inch retina HD display, a new home button, 7MP HD front camera and 12MP rear
main camera, no traditional 3.5 mm headphone jack, iOS 10, A10 fusion chip and
and longest battery life to date.

Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available in India beginning October 7
in silver, gold, rose gold and the new black finish (jet black).
