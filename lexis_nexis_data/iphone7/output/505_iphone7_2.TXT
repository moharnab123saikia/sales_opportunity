With the launch of the iPhone 7 just around the corner, more news and leaks of
the iPhone 7 and its Plus variant are flooding the Internet. This time, a new
video compares the iPhone 7 to its earlier iPhone 6S.

This new video was leaked to Chinese social network Weibo, and compares the
upcoming handsets to last years iPhone 6S. There is no way of authenticating the
clip, but the device used in the video has a larger camera lens and a redesigned
antenna layout, which confirms earlier rumors seen in the past. In the video,
the headphone jack has disappeared from the iPhone 7, which is replaced with a
second speaker grille. This might be a new stereo sound feature for the upcoming
device.

The video shows both the front and back views of the iPhone 7. It also uses the
Space Gray color used in the past, however, the video does not talk about any of
the specs. The usual speed and power bumps can be expected, but there might just
be a boost to 3GB of RAM.

The iPhone 7 Plus is rumored to have a better camera, aimed at those who are
into smartphone photography. Anyways, it is just a matter of waiting for a few
months, as the phone will be out in September.
