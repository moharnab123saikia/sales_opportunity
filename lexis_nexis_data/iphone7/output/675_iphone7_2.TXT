Watch 2 launch event.

Shoppers are greeted by the message: "We can't wait to show you what we have in
store" when they visit the site.

The message adds: "Our virtual doors are just about to open. Thank you so much
for your enthusiasm and your patience as we work to get everyone in as quick as
possible.

"Keep checking back, because it won't be long now."

Gadget fans will finally find out what is special about the iPhone 7 when it is
unveiled by Apple at a "special event" in San Francisco later today.

iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 launch LIVE: Dual-lens camera and NO headphone jack
expected at Apple event 2016

Rumours have been swirling about the new iPhone for months, with numerous
tip-offs and leaked photos adding fuel to the frenzy.

iPhone 7: Release date, price, leaked pictures, and all the latest news and
rumours about Apple's new iPhone

The most persistent rumour is that Apple is going to get rid of the headphone
socket , meaning users will either have to use wireless Bluetooth headphones to
listen to music, or buy a pair of wired headphones that plug into the Lightning
port - currently used for charging.

There is also talk of a new camera with dual 12-megapixel lenses , which would
be able to snap SLR-quality photos and create special effects such as "bokeh".

However, this may only feature on the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus , not the 4.7-inch
iPhone 7.

The event will kick off at 10am local time, (6pm BST) at the Bill Graham Civic
Auditorium in San Francisco.
