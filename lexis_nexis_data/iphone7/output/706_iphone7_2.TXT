

Price for the new iPhones range all the way from INR 60,000 to nearly around a
lakh!

Its Oct 7, and for most of the Apple fans, here in India, it is definitely one
of the most exciting days in their life. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are all set to
go on sale on Flipkart today at 7 PM. However, we shall not be able to witness
the midnight launch in India, as they witnessed back in the West.

While Flipkart had already opened up the pre-booking for the new iPhone, those
who had paid the amount are expected to receive the device, as per the schedule
that was announced earlier. But, those who are looking forward to enter a store
and buying one, they will have to wait until 7 PM today.

The new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available in India in four color
schemes - Jet Black, Matte Black, Rose Gold, and Silver. However, it may be
really difficult to purchase a Jet Black model in India, well at least for some
time now.

So, refreshing once more about the price points of the new iPhones, the iPhone 7
with 32 GB internal storage comes at price starting at INR 60,000, while the
costliest variant with 256 GB internal storage may range around INR 92,000;
pretty much as the joke goes - sell a kidney and buy an iPhone 7!
