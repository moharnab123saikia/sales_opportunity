Recent reports suggest that the Apple iPhone 7 Plus might be coming with a dual
camera system option.

According to Ming Chi Kuo, a reliable Apple analyst from KGI securities, the
iPhone 7 Plus will have a dual camera system option with Link camera technology,
which Apple acquired last year. Apple will use two distinct lenses, which will
in turn use additional image data to create substantially better photos. It is
also a possibility that the Plus will feature an optical zoom with 2-3x
magnification.

Dual camera iPhones have been rumored for a long time, however the KGI report
makes it quite plain that not all iPhone 7 models will feature it. The 4.7 inch
iPhone 7 will not feature the technology, as it will be reserved specifically
for the 5.5 inch iPhone 7 Plus. According to the report, Apple might make a
distinction at the high end to create a premium SKU that includes the advanced
camera system, complete with optical image stabilization and wide field of view.

Apple may also be considering two separate options for the iPhone 7 Plus, only
one of which will make it to production. If Apple follows tradition, we will
have to wait for a 'S' version to get the camera upgrade. Sony is expected to be
the main supplier of the 12MP camera.

The iPhone 7 and its Plus variant are expected later this year, around fall,
with a smaller iPhone 5se launching this March.
