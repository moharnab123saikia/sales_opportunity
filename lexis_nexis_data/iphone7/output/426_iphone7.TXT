iPhone.

Remember how you had to pay double to get the new iPhone first in the UAE? Those
days are pretty much over as theÂ iPhone 7 launches in the UAE on the same date
as the US- September 16. That's right, you can pre-order the iPhone 7 in the UAE
on September 9 and have in in your hands the same day as buyers in the US or
other countries.

The iPhone 7 starts at AED 2,599 for the 32GB model, 2,999 for 128GB and 3,399
for 256GB. The iPhone 7 Plus starts at AED 3,099 for 32GB, 3,499 for 128GB and
3,899 for 256GB. The new models will be available in five colours- Black, Jet
Black, Silver, Gold and Rose Gold.

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were revealed by Apple today and feature the new
A10 processor along with a redesigned home button that works using the Taptic
Engine. Apple is doubling the capacities on each model so the iPhone 7 will be
available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage capacities.
As expected, Apple has removed the headphone jack, however, the new iPhone 7 has
stereo speakers. It is also now water and dust resistant. The iPhone 7 Plus has
a dual camera setup that helps produce optical zoom
