The iPhone 7 is still brand new, but that doesnt stop iPhone 8 rumors from
popping up, and turns out there might be a camera upgrade in the next phone.

According to an employee from  an Apple hardware development office in Israel,
workers are tinkering with what is "next" for Apple, while also specifically
referring to iPhone 8. The name itself is important, as with traditional Apple
naming convention goes, 2017 would be the year for the iPhone 7S. This might
also mean that Apple will be improving on the iPhone 7 in such a way that they
will have to skip the iPhone 7S and go straight to iPhone 8.

Additionally, it looks like there could be a chance that Apple may adopt a glass
back with the next phone. Rumors also point at a camera upgrade, which is usual,
but one there are chances that the iPhone 7 Plus's dual camera system to be
stuffed into the regular iPhone 8.

With the iPhone 8 set to be the 10th iPhone, it can be expected that Apple might
go all out with the next iPhone.
