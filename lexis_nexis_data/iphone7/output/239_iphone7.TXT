rumors that tech giant Apple plans to do away with the headphone jack on its
forthcoming 2016 iteration of the iPhone --- iPhone 7.

Interestingly, however, despite the fact that it has, of late been, widely
speculated that Apple will likely give the headphone jack a miss on the iPhone 7
handset, most of the reports have also been asserting that the elimination of
the headphone jack will not make the iPhone 7 any thinner than the
current-generation iPhone models.

The latest reports about Apple eliminating the headphone jack on its
next-generation iPhone 7 handset are chiefly based on the images leaked by a
Japanese magazine. According to the magazine's claims, the leaked images of
iPhone 7 are authentic.

The magazine has also apparently disclosed that the overall look of iPhone 7
will be quite similar to that of iPhone 6S handset. The iPhone 6S is thicker
than the iPhone 6 -- which at 6.9mm is the thinnest Apple iPhone ever - and the
increased thickness gives iPhone 6S more sturdiness.

Meanwhile, about Apple's decision to discontinue the headphone jack on iPhone 7,
well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that Apple will be breaking away from
tradition for this year's iPhone, so that it can introduce some radical design
changes to the 2017 iPhone -- iPhone 8 -- which will probably come with an OLED
screen without the physical home button.
