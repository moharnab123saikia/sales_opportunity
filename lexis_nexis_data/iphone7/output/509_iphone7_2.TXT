Apple chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the iPhone 7, saying the firm's
smartphone had become the "industry gold standard", and the smartphone "by which
all overs are measured".

iPhone 7 will cost $649(around Â£500), coming in silver, gold, rose gold, black
and the new jet black.

It will be released in the UK on September 16.

iPhone 7 Plus starts at $769.

4G mast will bring better North Wales mobile coverage...but could hit YOUR
television signal

They will both be available in sizes up to 256GB.

The iPhone 7 has stereo speakers for the first time.

iPhone 7 Plus is set to have two cameras. This will have a superior zoom feature
than the standard iPhone 7. The new camera system has optical image
stabilisation, to prevent shaking hands from ruining images.

The second lens on the 7 Plus is a 'telephoto' lens and will enable users to
quickly zoom in without losing image quality - something that has plagued
smartphones for years.

An extra two hours of battery life will be added onto the new iPhone 7 and 7
Plus models.

The new iPhone will be water and dust resistant.

The home button has been given a vibration-based taptic feedback system so it
now vibrates when touched to give users feedback. The feature is already in use
on the firm's MacBook laptops.

Apple also confirmed the removal of the headphone jack connection on the base of
the phone. Apple said it now includes earphones in their boxes that connect to
the iPhone's Lightning connection, currently used for charging and data
transfer.

An adaptor will also be included in the box that will enable traditional
headphone users to connect to the new iPhone and continue to use their existing
headset.

New "breakthrough" wireless EarPods called AirPods were also unveiled for those
wanting to go wireless.
