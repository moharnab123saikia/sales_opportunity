Rumors suggest that the iPhone 7 will be out in September, but if these rumors
are to be believed, you can also expect a massive design change.

Apple is reportedly doing away with the famous iPhone camera bump that made the
lens protrude from the body of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. This design choice was
debuted in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus way back in 2014, and critics often compared
the phone to a wobbly bar stool when kept on a flat surface. However, with the
iPhone 7, the lens bump will be gone with the rest of the aluminum back, along
with the rear antenna lines as well. The same clean look will also make way to
the iPhone 7 Plus, but with a dual camera system as well.

iPhone 7 is not the next iPhone to be announced, because Apple might be coming
out with a smaller iPhone 5SE next month. This 4 inch iPhone, earlier called
iPhone 6C, is rumored to contrast with the flagship iPhone by combining the
iPhone 6S specs with a small hand friendly design that is closer to the iPhone
5S.

Apple is rumored to have a major event in March, and if the rumors are to be
true it will showcase a lineup of new phones, tablets and wearables: the iPhone
5SE, iPad Air 3 and new Apple Watch bands. If the 5SE is announced at the event,
it leaves just 7 months for the iPhone 7. Additional hints to the iPhone 7 might
also be visible with the iOS 10 beta expected in June.
