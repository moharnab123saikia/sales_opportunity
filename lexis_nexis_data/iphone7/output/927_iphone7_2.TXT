

And with it, an example of irony

The guys over at Uniqfind recently came out with a brand new phone cover for the
iPhone 7 called the "Explo-sung", but what they dont know is the irony in it.

With all the news going around of Samsung's explosive fiasco, literally, it was
only a matter of time before parodies and jokes came out. At first it was the
GTA V game mod, which replaced the grenades in the game with the Note7, and now
it is this new phone cover for the iPhone 7 from Uniqfind. The new phone skin
called the Explo-sung, is according to the company, "a merciless way to dress up
your iPhone this Halloween." Essentially, the cover will make your iPhone 7 look
like a burnt phone, which is quite distasteful.

The irony in this is, the last phone to explode was note the Note7, instead an
iPhone 7 in Australia. According to reports, a man's iPhone 7 in Australia burst
into flames and destroyed his car. Mat Jones left his phone in the car under his
clothes and went surfing, which is when his iPhone 7 caught fire. Apple is
reportedly investigating the case, and we yet have to hear an official statement
from them.
