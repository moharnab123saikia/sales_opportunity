

After Apple's launch of its new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones
yesterday, the prices of the new models in Israel have been revealed. At iStore,
the iPhone 7 will start at NIS 3,649, and the iPhone 7 Plus will start at NIS
4,249. Prices will be higher for handsets with expanded memory. The new
telephones are expected to reach Israel in mid-October.

Apple's telephones will be available in two new colors in Israel, black and jet
black. The new features include resistance to water and dust to the IP67
standard, a camera with an f/1.8 lens and a 12MP sensor, a front MP7 camera, a
quad-core A10 Fusion processor, flash with four lamps, and a Retina HD screen
with improved colors and clarity.

The iPhone 7 Plus has a double camera for better zooming performance.

With the advent of the new iPhones, earlier models will naturally be available
more cheaply. The price of the iPhone 6s has fallen from NIS 3,800 to NIS 3,000.
iStore will no longer sell the iPhone 6.
