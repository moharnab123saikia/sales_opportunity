modems for Apple's iPhone 7 smartphones will be divided between Intel and
Qualcomm.



The Bloomberg report comes against the backdrop of multiple rumors that, while
Qualcomm is the existing supplier of LTE and Wi-Fi modems for iPhones, a
fraction of LTE and Wi-Fi modems for iPhone 7 will be supplied by Intel as well.


According to the Bloomberg report, LTE and Wi-Fi modems for iPhone 7 models for
AT&T will be supplied by Intel. In addition, Intel modems will also be used in
some other iPhone 7 versions sold in other countries.

On the other hand, the iPhone 7 models for Verizon will be equipped with LTE and
Wi-Fi modems supplied by Qualcomm. Furthermore, Qualcomm modems will also be
reserved for all the iPhone 7 models aimed at the Chinese market.

Meanwhile, going by the rumors, the Intel modem which Apple will use in iPhone 7
series will be the XMM 7360 LTE modem, with theoretical download and upload
speeds of up to 450 Mbps and 100 Mbps respectively. The Qualcomm modem for
iPhone 7 series will likely be the X12 modem, which will boast theoretical
download and upload speeds of up to 600 Mbps and 150 Mbps respectively.
