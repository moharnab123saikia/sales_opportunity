on expensive cameras, but event organizers are showing that beautiful images can
come from just about anywhere.


TIFF has debuted its first-ever official photo studio and all of the photos were
shot on Apple's soon-to-be-released iPhone 7.


Announced last weekat Apple's annual fall product event, the iPhone 7 features
the most advanced camera yet available in an iPhone. Its features include
optical image stabilization, which reduces blur from shaking or motion, a larger
aperture to enhance low-light photos, and a flash that is 50 percent brighter
than the iPhone 6s.


Organizers have seen an increasing number of photos and videos being taken on
mobile devices and the iPhone 7-shot photos at this year's festival was a nod to
those efforts. The 2015 film Tangerine, for example, was shot entirely using the
iPhone 5s.


For its official TIFF photo studio, event organizers called on photographer Matt
Barnes to shoot everyone from Oliver Stone to Chris Pratt on the iPhone 7. It
comes on the heels of the festival's first-ever Instagram competition, the
TIFFxInstagram Shorts Festival, winners of which were announced Aug. 18.


The iPhone 7 is not yet available to the general public. It is currently open
for pre-orders and will go on sale Sept. 16.
