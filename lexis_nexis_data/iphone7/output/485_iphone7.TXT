New Delhi, April 27 -- Zee Media Bureau
 Every iPhone unveiled throughout the years have created a buzz like no other
smartphone in the world. But with never seen-before features on phones, why not
the buzz?


 However, according to reports and buzz surrounding the latest iPhone 7 which is
all set to see the light of the day in September, it could be a big
disappointment.
 But why?
 Well! 2017 being iPhone's tenth birthday, Apple is likely to keep the best of
features for the iPhone 8 which will be unveiled then.
 According to reports, Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at KGI Securities who has been
called the "best Apple analyst on the planet" says that the iPhone 7 will not
have "many attractive selling points".
 Ming-Chi Kuo is known to have revealed or leaked many interesting and correct
features of iPhones.
 So, according to Kuo, the iPhone 7 will look very similar to the iPhone 6 and
6S while the main innovations could be wireless charging, a better camera,
longer battery life and the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack.
 According to reports, Kuo also predicts that the iPhone 7 Plus version will
have an even better camera, and that Apple could release a third "Pro" model
called the iPhone 7 DC, which will feature a dual-lens camera and a magnetic
smart connector.
 However, Kuo feels these changes won't be dramatic enough and that iPhone sales
will drop to between 190 and 205 million in 2016.
 So, are you exciting about the iPhone 7 anyway?
