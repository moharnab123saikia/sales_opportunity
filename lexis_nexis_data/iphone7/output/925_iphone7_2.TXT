around the globe snapping up the new smartphone from Apple.

As device owners look to sell their older models, research from online auction
site eBay has revealed sales of previous models are soaring.

Mirror Online reports that sales of the refurbished iPhone 5c and 6s are both up
by a third since the Apple announcement.

The devices are attracting an average price of £89.00 and £440.00 on the
marketplace respectively.

By contrast, a 32GB version of the iPhone 7 can be purchased for around £750.00
on eBay.

eBay has released the data as part of its first ever  UK Retail Report,  looking
at how we shop as a nation.

The iPhone is one of the most consistently searched-for items on eBay in the UK,
with over 400,000 searches for iPhone 7 on eBay in the UK last week alone.

"Savvy shoppers are increasingly keen on refurbished, nearly-new technology to
get contemporary brands at more affordable prices," said Murray Lambell,
director of UK trading at eBay.

iPhone 7 has one MAJOR drawback in cold weather

"On eBay we're seeing more and more shoppers get involved in the 'circular
economy' - trading in their old tech and using the profits to buy a newer
model."

"If you've got an older version of the iPhone, now could be the time to cash
in," said Lambell. "On average we've seen Brits save around 45% on the latest
tech this way in 2016.
