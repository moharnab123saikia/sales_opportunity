

The iPhone 7 launch event is finally here, and it's now looking almost certain
that the new phone will come without a headphone socket .

But don't panic! It's very unlikely that Apple will let you go without access to
music - particularly given the growth of its highly lucrative streaming service,
Apple Music .

There's already a huge amount of speculation about what headphones Apple will
bundle with the iPhone 7 - ranging from wireless "AirPods" to EarPods that use a
Lightning port connector.

There's even some suggestion that the iPhone 7 will come with a
Lightning-to-headphone-jack adapter in the box.

However, don't forget that Apple now owns headphone maker Beats Electronics,
after buying the company for $3 billion in 2014.

The latest rumour suggests that Beats may be providing the solution to iPhone
users' woes.

iPhone 7 could give Apple fans one very big reason to upgrade

According to an email sent out to French-speaking journalists by Beats' PR team,
and posted online by igen.fr , Apple's event on September 7 will allow attendees
to "discover new products from Beats by Dre".

It goes on say the event that "can't be missed" - suggesting that a selection of
new products from Beats by Dre will be revealed at the event.

It would make sense for Beats to release a refreshed headphone lineup to
coincide with the iPhone 7 launch.

This will most likely include a selection of wireless Bluetooth headphones and
wired headphones with a Lightning port connector.

The question is, will other headphone makers be forced to release special models
with a lightning connection too? While an adaptor may provide a temporary
solution, many have pointed out it could easily be lost.

Apple is expected to unveil its iPhone 7 at an event in San Francisco on
September 7. For all the latest rumours, check out our full round-up here .
