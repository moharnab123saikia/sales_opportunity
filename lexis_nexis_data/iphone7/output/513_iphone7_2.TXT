disappoint you

Apple's iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus seems to have a hissing problem, according to
reports from users and reviewers. The issue was first noted by 512 Pixels'
Stephen Hackett, who posted about the same on Twitter, and also shared a YouTube
link to the hissing sound from his iPhone 7 Plus. [Check out the video here]

Hackett wrote on Twitter, "My iPhone 7 Plus makes terrible noises when under
load," and has added the YouTube link. And his complaint has been corroborated
by others as well who are facing the same problem.

TechCrunch writer Darrell Etherington also posted on Twitter saying a brand new,
just un-boxed iPhone 7 Plus was doing the same thing, aka the hissing sound. It
seems the iPhone 7 series is making this hissing sound, which is what is known
as a 'coil noise' made by a high-powered processor when under load.

At present, there are several theories about why this is happening, even though
nobody knows the real cause behind it.

Engadget Jon Fingas said that "some suspect coil whine or similar
electromagnetic effects." He also points out that it's not a universal problem
because he has "tested an iPhone 7 using 3DMark 'Ice Storm Extreme,' a
performance benchmark that puts the processor under serious strain, and heard no
hissing at all."

Apple Insider speculated that it "could involve the RF transmitter or some other
form of interference with the speaker system."

According to iMore, this hissing sound is not just an iPhone 7 problem. The
author noted that pretty much all devices make this 'hissing noise' especially
in "high-intensity CPU/GPU activity."

Apple has so far declined to comment on 'hissing-gate.' Instead it reminded
iPhones had faced the bending issue, but it was still one of the most talked
about things for the iPhone 6 Plus launch.
