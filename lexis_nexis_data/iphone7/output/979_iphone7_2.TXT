quotient among the people in city, who just can't refrain from having a go at
the 'ridiculous' price tag. Amid the iPhone craze that is gripping the city,
many have chosen not to go by the hype. They even have begun cracking jokes on
the price of the smartphone.From Bollywood songs to funny memes, Indoreans are
trying all means to mock the high price using WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.
"RIP to my bank account," posted Dristi Agarwal, which has turned out to be of
the most liked posts on Facebook. Some are comparing other smartphones to show
how 'love for iPhone is blind'. Tweets and posts like "iPhone is the Salman Khan
of the mobile world" and "iPhone 7 costs more than what Harman Baweja earned
from his Bollywood career" are becoming more and more popular. The iPhone 7 and
iPhone 7 plus will be available in India from October 7 with prices starting
from Rs 60,000.The newly launched iWatch also seems to be a Diwali favourite
with Indoreans. "Last year I had sold one kidney and this year it seems I will
have to sell another one," posted Sumit Ranjan.
