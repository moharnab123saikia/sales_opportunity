the processor is working hard.

Aside from a launch day stock sellout and a few issues with iOS 10, the iPhone 7
has been a pretty well received device so far. However, there might be a new
annoyance in store for some surprised fans.

A few iPhone 7 users have reported that the new smartphone from Apple makes an
odd hissing sound when processing heavy loads. First pointed out by Stephen
Hackett of 512 Pixels, other users have also complained on Twitter that they're
experiencing the same problem, with both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus.

By Hackett's account, his iPhone 7 began hissing when restoring it from iCloud.
The sound seemed to be emanating from the phone's rear, possibly due to the A10
processor facing near overload. Here's the video Hackett posted, so you can
listen to the white noise for yourself.

Users have compared the sound to that of a CPU's fans whirring loudly when the
processor is at work, except, obviously, the new iPhone has no such fans. The
fact that the iPhone 7 is supposed to be a more power efficient device than its
predecessors makes the phenomenon even more perplexing.

Apple has made no official comment on the hissing so far, However, it might
point to a defect in the manufacturing process and not something affecting all
iPhone 7s, considering the company's customer care support responded to
Hackett's complaint by asking him to have his iPhone replaced.
