

CELCOM Axiata Bhd is confident the sale of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will
outperform the sale of the last models, considering their advanced and
sophisticated features and the company's attractive packages.

Its chief marketing officer Zalman Aefendy Abidin said Celcom had recorded
pre-orders of 1,000 units for the smartphones prior to the launch yesterday.

"The iPhone 7 is a great smartphone and it is certainly an upgrade from the
previous models.

"What we want to make sure is for you to have a great network behind it because
if you do not have great coverage, there is no use of having such an advanced
phone," he said after the launch yesterday.

At the announcement yesterday, the first seven customers queueing up at the Blue
Cube@Sunway Pyramid, as early as 6am, get to buy their iPhone 7 for RM7.

In conjunction with the launch, Celcom Axiata also hosted a game of "spin the
wheel" where customers can try their luck at winning the iPhone 7 for only RM7,
RM77 or RM777, as well as, accessories.

"We are ecstatic to bring customers the trendy and sophisticated iPhone 7 and
iPhone 7 Plus through our FIRST plans.

"Our exclusive promotions and robust 4G LTE network will ensure quality
experience for all iPhone customers," said Celcom Axiata business operations
deputy chief executive officer Azwan Khan Osman Khan.

iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus feature an all new advanced camera system, dust- and
water-resistant design, stereo speaker system and A10 Fusion chip, which is the
most powerful chip on any smartphone while delivering the best battery life ever
in an iPhone.

For the Celcom First iPhone 7 plan, the 12GB Internet package will be RM98 while
the iPhone 7 will be priced from RM2,058 and iPhone 7 Plus from RM2,558.

For the Celcom First Platinum plan, the 18GB Internet package will be RM150
