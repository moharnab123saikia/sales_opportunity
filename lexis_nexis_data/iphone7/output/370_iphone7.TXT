

Apple has said its initial stocks of the iPhone 7 Plus and the jet black version
of the iPhone 7 have sold out, a day before the smartphones go on sale.

The technology giant said the entire stockpile has been bought during the
pre-order period, which began last Friday, two days after the phone was
revealed.

Queues have already begun to appear outside Apple stores around the world ahead
of the full launch on Friday morning, but Apple confirmed some versions of the
phones would not be available to walk-in customers.

"We couldn't be happier with the initial response to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7
Plus, and we are looking forward to beginning sales through our retail stores
and partners around the world," Apple's statement read.

"Beginning Friday, limited quantities of iPhone 7 in silver, gold, rose gold and
black will be available for walk-in customers at Apple retail stores. During the
online pre-order period, initial quantities of iPhone 7 Plus in all finishes and
iPhone 7 in jet black sold out and will not be available for walk-in customers.
Availability at partner locations for all finishes may vary and we recommend
checking directly with them."

As well as the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, a new version of the Apple Watch - known as
the Series 2 and water resistant for the first time - will also go on sale.

"Customers can continue to order all models in all colours on Apple.com. We
sincerely appreciate our customers' patience as we work hard to get the new
iPhone into the hands of everyone who wants one as quickly as possible."

The iPhone 7 made headlines when announced as the first iPhone to be water
resistant, and it also sees the removal of the traditional headphone jack in
favour of connection by the Lighting port, currently used for data transfer and
charging.

The tech giant also announced a new set of wireless earphones, called EarPods,
as an alternative connection mehod. They will go on sale later this year.
