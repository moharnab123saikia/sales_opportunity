after its global unveiling at the Bill Graham Centre in San Francisco on
Wednesday. When sales start on October 7, the iPhone 7 model will become
available for prices starting Rs 60,000 for the 32GB version. This is
significant as the iPhone 6s 16GB had an India launch price of Rs 62,000.
Pricing of the iPhone 7 Plus is still unknown. The new iPhone 7 series comes
with new updates to performance, camera and display technology. Last year the
iPhone 6s started at Rs 62,000 going up all the way to Rs 82,000 in India; the
iPhone 6s Plus started at Rs 72,000 going up all the way to Rs 92,000.

An Apple press note confirmed India will be in the second batch of countries,
which will get the newly announced iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This is also the
first time they've confirmed the India pricing at the launch event itself. Like
with the iPhone SE, Apple has been quick to announce the price, thus putting an
end to unnecessary speculation. Apple also confirmed prices for the new
accessories. The wireless AirPods including charging case will be available for
Rs 15,400 beginning in late October. All iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models will
include EarPods with Lightning Connector and a Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone
Jack Adapter. Apple will sell these separately as well at Rs 2,500 and Rs 900,
respectively. With such a pricing and no headphone jack, it was obvious for
social media to react. Here are some of the reactions:

Apple iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus go on sale on September 16 in stores, although
pre-orders open from September 9.
