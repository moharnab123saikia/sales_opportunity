both steadily building.

In the latest juicy leak around the device, TechTastic claims it's gotten its
hands on leaked photos of the iPhone 7, that show a device smaller and somewhat
thicker than the iPhone 6S.

The spy shot of the phone's back reveals a slightly larger lens, that's been
shifted closer to the top left of the device, which indicates some of the
internal components have shifted around.

It also seems iPhone has finally taken notice of all the copycats and changed
its design aesthetic as well. The lines of polished metal that previously
interrupted the brushed metal look on the rear cover now instead sit on the
edges, following the phone's curves.

The other photos purportedly show schematics for the iPhone 7, with a
side-by-side comparison to the iPhone 6S. The iPhone 7 is a wee bit shorter than
the current flagship, and is also 0.05mm thicker, at 7.15mm. The device is also
0.7mm narrower than the iPhone 6S, so unfortunately your old cases aren't going
to fit.

Of course, we can't independently verify the authenticity of these images, so
fingers crossed that these images are legitimate.
