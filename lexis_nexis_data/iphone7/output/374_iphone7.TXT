Apple watchers at Japan's Mac Otokara website affirm based on "reliable
sources," that Apple indeed will call its upcoming smartphones the iPhone 7 and
7 Plus, passing on a possible iPhone 7 Pro.

There have been rumors that Apple would deliver three new phones in September,
with the iPhone 7 Pro featuring a dual-lens camera. It appears now that Apple
will stick with two new phones, including the dual-lens camera in the iPhone 7
Plus.

After having introduced iPad Pro tablets last year, it was conceivable that
Apple might have initiated a Pro line of iPhones, too.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are expected to start at 32GB of storage, boast better
battery life, include a more powerful processor, forego a traditional 3.5mm
headphone jack in favor of an Apple Lightning connectivity option and feature
other upgrades over the most recent iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. As with those models,
4.7- and 5.5-inch models are expected this time around.

The real excitement will start post-September, as rumors go wild over what Apple
has planned for 2017, during which it will celebrate the 10th anniversary of its
smartphone with the iPhone 8 ...or whatever the company has in store.

Apple is expected to announce its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus devices on Sept. 7.
