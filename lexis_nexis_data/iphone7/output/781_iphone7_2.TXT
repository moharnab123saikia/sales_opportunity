While Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 7 could post a small increase over the
current iPhone 6S series, sales of next year's iPhone 8 could jump close to 20%
over the iPhone 7, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said Wednesday.

Milunovich increased his iPhone unit sales estimates for both the iPhone 7 and
iPhone 8.

He raised his fiscal 2017 iPhone unit sales estimate to 222 million from 207
million and fiscal 2018 estimate to 264 million from 240 million. He is
predicting iPhone unit sales growth of 5% for fiscal 2017, which starts Sept.
25, and 18% for fiscal 2018.

IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 34, putting it near the
bottom third for performance vs. other stocks in key metrics over the last 12
months. For a list of top-performing stocks, check out the IBD 50.

Apple is expected to release its iPhone 7 in mid-September. It is rumored to be
an incremental upgrade with bigger changes to the design happening with next
year's handset.

"We have higher confidence in at least some growth for the iPhone 7," Milunovich
said in a research report Wednesday.

He raised his earnings-per-share estimate for fiscal 2017 to $9 from $8.90 and
for fiscal 2018 to $10.80 from $10.40.

"This is the first time in a while we have increased estimates, suggesting
potential for further stock gains," Milunovich said. "We continue to see limited
downside (for Apple stock) given low valuation, especially when the cash balance
and fact that Apple reports GAAP earnings are taken into account. However, we
doubt there are sufficient catalysts yet for a substantial move up."

Milunovich rates Apple stock as buy with a 12-month price target of 115.

Apple rose 1.3% to 105.79 on the stock market today.
