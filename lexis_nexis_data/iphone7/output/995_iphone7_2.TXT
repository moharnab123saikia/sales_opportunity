Apple's iPhone 7 home button has a virtual alternative that turns on
automatically if the physical button fails to perform.

According to the Apple-tracking website MacRumors, the virtual home button sits
neatly at the bottom of the iPhone 7's screen.

With the new iOS 10 in place, the iPhone 7 screen displays a message, saying
that "Home Button may need service and "onscreen Home Button" can be used in the
meantime.

"With the introduction of the iPhone 7, Apple did away with the classic
click-mechanism home button in favour of a 'solid-state' pressure sensitive one
that uses haptic feedback to mimic traditional button presses," the report
added.

The iPhone 7 home button was redesigned in 2016. The new home button is like a
sensor that can recognise a fingerprint and additional pressure.

"It also vibrates when a user presses the button, so he or she knows its
features have been activated," Fortune reported on Tuesday.

While the feature is technically hidden, it can be turned on whenever the
physical Home Button malfunctions.

Speculations are that Apple may finally move its home button into the glass on
its next iPhone variant - eliminating physical buttons once and for all.
