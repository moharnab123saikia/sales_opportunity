Apple still managed to sell a generous amount of its new smartphone, so much so
that people who didn't pre-order the jet black version will have trouble picking
one up from Apple stores.

According to an Apple statement, the company has already allocated all of its
iPhone 7 Plus stock and sold all of the jet black iPhone 7 versions, reports
Engadget.

'Beginning Friday, limited quantities of iPhone 7 in silver, gold, rose gold,
and black will be available for walk-in customers at Apple retail stores. During
the online pre-order period, initial quantities of iPhone 7 Plus in all finishes
and iPhone 7 in jet black sold out and will not be available for walk-in
customers,' Apple told TechCrunch.

Apple partners as well as carriers will have differing stock levels and may be
better equipped to handle customer orders.

Even online orders are indicating a 2-3 week waiting time so customers may need
to exercise some patience until backlogs get cleared up and more supply is made
available.
