Apple's new iPhones. "iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus users can enjoy 10 GB free
4G/3G data per month for one year with any Airtel Infinity postpaid plan," the
Sunil Bharti Mittal-controlled company said in a statement on Friday, when the
latest devices from Apple went on sale in India.

The free data will be in addition to plan benefits, the telco said. Officials
said the free data is worth some Rs 30,000 spread over a year. The iPhone 7 and
iPhone 7 Plus can be bought at retail shops or Airtel's official website.
Customers can enjoy the latest iPhones on Airtel's mobile broadband network with
bundles of data and unlimited voice calling with Infinity plans, said Ajai Puri,
Director Operations (India & South Asia).

The Infinity postpaid plans offer unlimited voice calling - local, STD and
national roaming - along with bundled 4G/3G data, SMS and free subscription to
Wynk music and Wynk movies.
