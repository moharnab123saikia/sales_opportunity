

Dozens of people have been queuing since early this morning to get their hands
on the new iPhone 7 in Birmingham which comes out today.

One man has been outside the Bullring store since midnight and others arrived at
6am to get their hands on the new flagship smartphone.

But the Bullring store had already sold out of the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone
7 in black to pre-orders before it opened its doors at 9.30am.

Staff say there will be no Iphone7s available to those who haven't pre ordered
and although the store normally opens at 8am, it was only letting in those who
had pre-ordered before 9.30am.

Radio WM presenter Daz Hale was outside the store to see the queues and broke
the news live on air to the eager customer who had camped outside since 12am
that there would be no IPhone7 Plus available today.

At first the young lad was in disbelief but then despondently said he would head
home back to bed.

There were some IPhone 7 phones available first thing this morning but many had
pre-ordered online to secure the device.

The new device is waterproof and the larger model comes with an dual lens camera
capable of of all kinds of photographic wizardry.

The iPhone 7 is available from a starting price of £599 for the cheapest 32GB
option. The 128GB version costs £699 and the 256GB version will set you back a
whopping £799.

The larger iPhone 7 Plus is even more of a wallet buster than it's smaller
sibling.

When does the new Apple store in Birmingham open?

The cheapest (32GB) iPhone 7 Plus costs £719, followed by a 128GB model at £819,
and then a 256GB variant costing an astonishing £919 in the UK.

If you want to buy the phone outright, the best thing to do is head straight to
Apple's website and pre-order it from there.

Forget your iPhone 7, your old iPod Classic could be worth even more
