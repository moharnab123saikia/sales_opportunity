iPhone 6S due to features such as a bigger battery and larger storage capacity,
according to a teardown by IHS Markit Ltd .Including $5 in basic manufacturing
costs, total cost to manufacture the iPhone 7 mobile rises to $224.

80, $36.89 higher than the business research provider's estimates for the iPhone
6S.

Apple retails an unsubsidized 32GB iPhone 7 at $649.The company unveiled the
iPhone 7 with high-resolution cameras and no headphone jack at its annual launch
on Sept 7 IHS Markit also said on Tuesday the iPhone 7's Bill Of Materials, a
financial estimate of the raw materials used, was "in line" with flagship
smartphones made by rival Samsung Electronics but Apple ekes out better margins.

"All other things being equal, Apple still makes more margin from hardware than
Samsung, but materials costs are higher than in the past," said Andrew
Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services at IHS Markit. IHS
Markit has not yet performed a teardown analysis on the larger iPhone 7 Plus.

Supplies of Apple's iPhone 7 Plus have been exhausted in all shades, and the
smaller iPhone 7 has also sold out in the new jet black colour, the company said
last week.Yet, in some markets, such as China, interest in the new phone has
been muted, as cheaper local brands amp up their design and marketing.
