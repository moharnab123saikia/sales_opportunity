be able to look closely at the Jet Black model as well

Mere seconds didn't pass when we provided you with the announcement of iPhone 7
and iPhone 7 Plus, and now you get to witness the official image gallery of both
smartphones. To keep you updated on the sort of upgrades regarding
specifications and features that are present inside both phones, both device
pack the A10 Fusion chipset. This chipset features a total of four cores. Two
cores will handle the most important and intensive applications and operations,
while the remaining two cores will focus on taking care of those less important
operations.

The new and improved 12MP sensor on the iPhone 7 is 60 percent faster and 30
percent more efficient than its predecessor and the iPhone 7 Plus is the only
one from the family to sport a dual 12MP camera. Both cameras have an aperture
of f/1.8, which will allow more light to enter and there are 4 LEDs present in
order to capture brighter and better images.

As expected iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come without the headphone jack, but do
feature Apple's EarPods with the Lightning connector. To make things simpler for
the user, there's even a Lightning-to-headphone jack so you can plug in your
previous earphones and headphones with ease. The best thing about both
smartphones is that they feature 32GB as their base storage models. The model in
the middle comes with 128GB of storage, and the highest capacity model comes
with 256GB of onboard memory, which is very impressive.
