After the success of the Apple iPhone 6s, rumors of the Apple iPhone 7 have
already started to make its way around the Internet.

The Apple iPhone 7 will most probably come with updated features, mainly 3GB of
RAM and a waterproof body. Similar to how the iPhone 6 had a 6s and Plus
variants, the iPhone 7 might also come with a Plus variant. However, the
increased RAM will not be a part of the Plus variant, as it may not be the
flagship. The iPhone 7 might be coming with a 5.5 inch screen. It may come with
a 4.0 inch screen iPhone C models early next year, but it is not confirmed if
the other variants will come out at the same time.

There are also rumors that the iPhone 7 might be waterproof. Apple has never
waterproofed their devices, so this might be a game changer for Apple and might
help Apple to cross the next milestone. Other details of the iPhone 7 have not
been confirmed by Apple so far.

Apple is also expected to ship 260 million iPhones in 2016, thus creating a gain
of 12.5 percent when compared to the 2015 shipments.
