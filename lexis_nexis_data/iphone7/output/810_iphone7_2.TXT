A passing reference by Bloomberg that Apple might introduce its new iPhones on
Sept. 7 has spurred a flurry of follow-up coverage all but confirming the
presumed iPhone 7 event.

The Bloomberg report is actually focused on Apple overhauling its MacBook Pro
laptop line for the first time in four years.

Apple Insider, Engadget & others (OK, and us) have pounced on the iPhone 7
announcement date, attributed to one unnamed person by Bloomberg.

The next iPhones, possibly the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, are expected to look
pretty similar to their predecessors, but changes expected include elimination
of the standard 3.5mm headphone jack and standard home button as well as a
dual-lens camera for the larger phone.

Rumors last month pegged the iPhone announcement date as coming after Labor Day,
probably Sept. 6, followed by pre-orders on Sept. 9 and availability on Sept.
16.
