as we test the camera, performance of this device.

Apple iPhone 7 is still a couple of weeks away for most Indians. However, that
hasn't prevented at least some people from bringing in the devices from other
markets where the phone has been successfully launched.

We were fortunate enough to get our hands on one of these devices and will have
it with us for a couple of days. We will use the opportunity to live with the
new iPhone 7 and see how much of a better experience is it offering. I am
currently using the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, and will try and compare the two
phones in terms of camera, speed and performance.

Below, see the comparison between the new iPhone 7 and last year's iPhone 6s
Plus camera. Both have 12MP rear cameras, but the iPhone 7 uses an f/1.8
aperture which gives it better performance in low light. You can see this extra
light clearly in the image below.

Here is my experience using the new Apple iPhone 7:

Everyone seems to have a problem with the headphone jack being removed. But for
people buying a new Apple iPhone 7 it won't be a big deal as you will get the
new earpods. For those hung up on using the 3.5mm jack headphone they love,
there is always the adapter in the box. Yes, it is an appendage, but nothing you
can live without.

We have a black model of the iPhone 7, not the Jet Black, just the black which
is matte and more subtle. It is a head-turner no doubt and is one of the most
stylish phones around. There is no real difference in design, but the muted
antenna bands give the phone some extra style quotient.
