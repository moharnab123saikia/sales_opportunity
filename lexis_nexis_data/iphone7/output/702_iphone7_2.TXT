Initial quantities of the iPhone 7 Plus have already sold out and will no longer
be available for walk-in customers.

The larger version of Apple's new iPhone generation has sold out in all
available finishes according to the company.

The smaller iPhone 7 model will still be available for walk-in customers, but
those looking for the larger device will have to go to the company's website.

"We sincerely appreciate our customers' patience as we work hard to get the new
iPhone into the hands of everyone who wants one as quickly as possible."

Apple will not publish sales data for the first weekend after release,
unusually.

The new generation of the Apple iPhone, including the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7
Plus, was launched on 7 September at Apple's annual event in San Francisco. It
became available for pre-order September 9 and release on September 16.

The standard headphone jack has been removed, with users now able to connect
headphones through Apple's lightning port. This has allowed Apple to make the
device slightly thinner.

The design is fairly similar to the iPhone 6 and the display on the device is
brighter and more colourful.

It adds a new dual-lens camera to improve photo quality and a processor that is
apparently twice as fast as that on the iPhone 6.

The device also apparently has the best battery life on an iPhone and is
water-resistant.
