does, on what the next big launch from Palo Alto will be. But remember it is
just a guess at the end of the day. Apple always manages to surprise everyone
with what they bring to the table in the end, even though the impact of this has
been coming down over the past few launches due to the barrage of leaks. But
yes, there is a big ticket Apple event in San Francisco on September 7 and there
will be a bunch of new devices.

What will be launched?

So far the expectation is that Apple will announce the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7
Plus. However, there has been some talk about an Apple iPhone 6SE and even an
Apple iPhone 7 Pro. We can only wait and watch to see what all CEO Tim Cook
unveils on Wednesday. For now it seems the iPhone 7 Pro is pretty much off the
list though. There will be a new Apple Watch in all probability, maybe be with a
SIM slot, but surely running WatchOS 3. There is also likely to be one or more
new iPads and a new range of MacBooks too.

What are the new iPhone 7 features?

There are a lot of rumours doing the rounds. But the features that look certain
are the dual camera rig, most probably on the costlier iPhone 7 Plus, a version
with 256GB internal storage and no 3.5mm audio jack on the phones. Also, Apple
is likely to make 32GB storage standard in the base model.

The disclaimer here is that everything about an Apple event is in the realm of
speculation till Tim Cook takes the stage. And we just don't know what is up
Apple's sleeve. However, we will let you know with live coverage from the Bill
Graham Centre on Wednesday.
