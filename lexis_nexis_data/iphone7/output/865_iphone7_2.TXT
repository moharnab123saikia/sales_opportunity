

With Apple"s next announcement just days away, predictions for features in the
much anticpated iPhone 7 are in overdrive.

Apple"s September 7 (5am September 8 NZT) announcement is when the tech giant
unveils its new devices and the star of the show is expected to be the heavily
rumoured iPhone 7.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who last year correctly predicted Apple
would launch the iPhone SE, expects the iPhone 7 to be waterproof, according to
a 9to5Mac report.

Watch: First look at the iPhone 7:

The report from KGI Securities said the iPhone 7 would have a waterproof rating
of IPX7, on par with the Apple Watch. This rating would mean the phone would
withstand immersion in water up to 1 metre for up to 30 minutes.

The iPhone 7 will also come in two new color options which KGI describes as
"dark black" and glossy "piano black", replacing space grey.

KGI predicts the iPhone 7 screen display will also be getting an upgrade,
although size and resolution will stay the same. The screen display will "copy"
the visual features of the iPad Pro, meaning it will render wide-colour imagery.

Heavy speculation suggests Apple will add a second camera lens to the rear of
the smartphone for the first time while also removing the headphone jack and
moving to wireless earphones. On the storage front, Apple is expected to dump
its 16GB and 64GB options for new 32GB, 128GB and 256GB tiers.

A second generation of the Apple Watch and more information on iOS 10 could also
be revealed at the event in San Francisco.

Tech journalists from around the world attend the event to witness the launch of
the new devices first hand.

Apple always live-streams its launch events and people wanting to watch the
event on a Mac can open Safari, go to the Apple website and watch it live.
