

When analysts heard last week that Apple would not be releasing first-weekend
pre-orders for the iPhone 7, at least one said it was an indication that the
company knew its product was cmature.c But Sprint and T-Mobile, two of the
nationcs biggest wireless carriers, on Tuesdaycsaid their pre-orders showcplenty
of demand for Applecs newest smartphone.

T-Mobile said orders for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus over the weekend (Friday
through Monday) cshattered all previous pre-order recordsc at the carrier. It
also said pre-registrations before then also broke records.

Sprint said pre-orders were up more thanc375 percent in the first three days
compared with last year.

Neither of the rival carriers provided actual numbers of orders, but both
T-Mobile CEO John Legere and Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure attributed the rise in
numbers to their networksc superior offerings, of course.

The carriersc reports contradict a survey released Monday that said iPhone 7
demand was down compared with the demand for the iPhone 6 last year.

Apple shares are up more than 2.5 percent to $108.11 amid a mostly down day for
the stock markets.

The new iPhones will be available at stores starting Friday.
