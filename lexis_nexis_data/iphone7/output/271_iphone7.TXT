variants of the upcoming iPhone 7 this year. The third variant, speculated to be
called, iPhone 7 Pro, has now allegedly appeared in two photos spotted by the
Nowhereelse website.

The pictures claim to show iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 7 Pro
side-by-side from the front and back.The images show iPhone 7 Pro featuring a
dual-camera setup at the back. In addition, the device also has smart magnetic
connector in the lower back panel. We assume it may be used specifically with
some battery accessory. Apple introduced similar magnetic connectors with iPad
Pro for its keyboard accessory.The images also contradicts KGI Securities
analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's previous statement claiming that the iPhone 7 Plus model
will feature a dual-camera setup. As in the images, both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7
Plus models sport a single camera at the back. From the front (image shared on
Weibo), all three variants appear to be the same, featuring large-screen bezels
on top and bottom along with the home button with Touch ID technology. Also, in
the picture while both iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Pro appear to be the bigger
version of iPhone 7. The dual-camera setup is widely rumoured to have been
manufactured by a company called LinX (acquired by Apple last year). The two
cameras are said to improve low-light photography, post-editing experience and
help in adjusting the focus on the subject and background.
