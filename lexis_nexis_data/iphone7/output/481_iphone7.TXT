

Now that Apple is going to launch the iPhone 5S and 5C in India on the 1st
November, we can expect the iPhone 5 to move out of the iPhone list.

Last year's marvel, the iPhone 5 will soon be taken off the list of phones Apple
will supply henceforth as the iPhone 5C comes to replace the iPhone 5. According
to a report in the Korean news portal ETNews earlier this year, Apple was
expected to stop the production of the iPhone 5 after the launch of an 'iPhone
Mini' this year.

Apple likely to discontinue iPhone 5? Apple announced that it will stop the
iPhone 5 production, making the iPhone 4S the base model.

The company launched the iPhone 5C as a colourful and plastic addition to the
iPhone ramge, with slight improvements. Along with this it launched the iPhone
5S with a 64-bit processor underneath. We can now expect the iPhone 5C to take
the place of iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4S to get a price cut as it takes the place
of the older iPhone.

Now the iPhone 4S has got a price cut, and is available for Rs 7000 less in the
market, as the base model. The phone can be purchased at Rs 31500 today. In Q2
this year Apple introduces a buyback scheme on the  iPhone 5making it more
affordable. It allowed a refund of up to Rs. 6000 ($111) if they are using an
American Express card on the purchase of an iPhone 4, 4S, or 5 before June 10.
