

Noida (Uttar Pradesh): At the stroke of 7 pm on Friday, the month-long wait to
grab an iPhone 7 came to an end as Apple enthusiasts, who pre-ordered iPhone 7
and 7 Plus devices, swarmed Apple flagship and retail stores across the country
to grab their handsets.

After receiving a stupendous response from 28 countries in the first phase,
beginning from September 16, and additional 30 countries from September 24,
iPhone 7 and 7 Plus finally arrived in India and the mood was upbeat. "I want to
thank Apple enthusiasts for breaking all records with the new iPhone 7 launch.
This launch is beyond comparison in India. This is iPhone 7, after all," Mikey
Todd, Managing Director, iZenica, Apple Premium Reseller in India, told IANS.
Available in silver, gold, rose gold and the new black finish (jet black),
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB models,
starting at Rs 60,000.

For Neha Rana, 24, holding her very own iPhone 7 was worth a long wait.

"Getting an iPhone on the very first day before others means a lot. My heart
skipped several beats as I held it for the first time. It's like carrying the
classiest brand in your pocket which speaks on its own," Rana, who got the
device from the iZenica Apple Store at GIP Mall here, told IANS.

iPhone 7 has water and dust resistance, dual-lens camera (in iPhone 7 Plus), a
pressure-sensitive home button, 7MP HD front camera and 12MP rear main camera.
