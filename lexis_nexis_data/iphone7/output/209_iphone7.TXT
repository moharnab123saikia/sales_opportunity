and not a part of it to pre-order.

We already know that Apple is all set to officially bring its newly launched
iPhone 7 and 7 Plus into India on Oct 7, and Flipkart is one of its partners.
However, with the actual date nearing, the good news is that, Flipkart is
accepting pre-orders for the new iPhones now, starting today.

Flipkart has launched a separate microsite for the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7
Plus where you can pre-order.

To pre-order, just visit the Flipkart homepage and you should be able to see an
'iPhone 7: Coming Soon' section, which you will have to click. Then, as of now,
the e-commerce portal is accepting your email address so that you can be
notified when the device is up for pre-order. However, it is being said that the
pre-order will be available from 11.59 PM today.

It is also being said that the user will have to pay the full amount of the
device during the pre-booking process, which is usually not the case. But, this
seems to be the case for the latest iPhones!

Speaking about the new iPhones' price tags, here is the list at which you can
purchase one in India:

iPhone 7 32 GB - INR 60,000

iPhone 7 128 GB - INR 70,000

iPhone 7 256 GB - INR 80,000
