Insights, iPhone 7 Plus handsets equipped with Intel modems are providing
drastically poorer Internet connections on the handsets as compared to the units
equipped with Qualcomm modems.

The report comes against the backdrop of complaints from some users of Apple's
latest iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets in the UK -- where the handsets went
on sale in September -- that they were witnessing performance drops,
specifically in terms of signal quality and strength while making calls.

With Apple having signed up both Intel and Qualcomm to supply modems for the
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets, Cellular Insights has revealed in its
report that Qualcomm modems in the new iPhones apparently offer a 30 percent
better performance than Intel modems.

Incidentally, as per the report, the performance drop issue in the new iPhones
largely affects the users of the iPhone 7 Plus handset in the UK, because those
units are equipped with Intel modems.

In the new iPhone units for the US, China and Japan markets, Apple has used the
more tried and trusted modems manufactured by Qualcomm.

About Apple's move to use Intel and Qualcomm modems for its new iPhones,
Cellular Insights said in its report: "We are not sure what was the main reason
behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest
iPhone."
