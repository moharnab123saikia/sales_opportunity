

After months of speculation, Apple have finally unveiled the iPhone 7 - and one
of the major rumours proved true.

The new unit no longer features a headphone jack - with users asked to plug
their headphones into the lightning charging port.

"The reason to move on really comes down to one word: courage," said Apple's
Phil Schiller, speaking of the jack's removal.

"The courage to move on and do something new that benefits all of us."

But while all iPhone 7 units will ship with a headphone adapter, some users are
worried about the development.

Disgruntled iPhone users took to Twitter to complain about the lightning
connection - which will meant some cannot charge their phone and use their
headphones simultaneously.

Ok wait so the iPhone 7 uses the Lightning input for headphones, does that mean
that I can't charge my phone while my headphones are in???

Sooooo I can't listen to music with headphones and charge my iPhone at the same
time unless I get the wireless headphones Apple common

Unless if you have bluetooth headphones, you can't use your headphones if your
iphone 7 is charging.

HOWEVER... now if you wanna use wired headphones while traveling, you can't
charge your iPhone at the same time lol So... Lame #AppleEvent

Another pointed out that the latest iPhone ear buds therefore won't be
compatible with the Apple Macbook.

So you can't unplug the headphones provided with the iPhone 7 and plug them into
your MacBook Pro. Unless something else is coming...
