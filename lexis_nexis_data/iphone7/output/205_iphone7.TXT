

Apple has announced both its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus phones and here's all
the important specs, features, pricing and other core details

The long wait is finally over and iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have officially
been announced. The company states that the new Jet Black color models and all
the other ones sport an aluminum body that have been extremely well crafted to
provide strength and an aesthetic upgrade to the smartphone lineup. Both
smartphones are outfitted with the A10 Fusion chipset, which features a total of
four cores. Two cores will handle the most important and intensive applications
and operations, while the remaining two cores will focus on taking care of those
less important operations.

The new and improved 12MP sensor on the iPhone 7 is 60 percent faster and 30
percent more efficient than its predecessor and the iPhone 7 Plus is the only
one from the family to sport a dual 12MP camera. Both cameras have an aperture
of f/1.8, which will allow more light to enter and there are 4 LEDs present in
order to capture brighter and better images.

As expected iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come without the headphone jack, but do
feature Apple's EarPods with the Lightning connector. To make things simpler for
the user, there's even a Lightning-to-headphone jack so you can plug in your
previous earphones and headphones with ease. The best thing about both
smartphones is that they feature 32GB as their base storage models. The model in
the middle comes with 128GB of storage, and the highest capacity model comes
with 256GB of onboard memory, which is very impressive.

iPhone 7  32GB: $649 for unlocked model
128GB: $749 for unlocked model
