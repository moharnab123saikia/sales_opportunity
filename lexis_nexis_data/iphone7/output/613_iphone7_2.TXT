SAN FRANCISCO It's iPhone Friday, and the early buzz is jet black is, well, the
new black.

That shade of the new iPhone 7, and all models of the iPhone 7 Plus, sold out
during online pre-orders, according to Apple. Consumers can still order the new
smartphones online but might have to wait until November for some models.

As they have in past years, the biggest fans - or maybe those just seeking the
media spotlight - lined up hours and even days ahead at flagship stores in New
York, San Francisco and Sydney.

Apple's latest should rack up a healthy first weekend of sales, according to
financial analysts. Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster and Angelo Zino, a financial
analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, predict shipments of more than 13
million for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus this weekend, topping last year's
first weekend for iPhone 6S.

But the iPhone love could be short-lived: Zino anticipates a year-over-year
decline in quarterly iPhone sales in September (45 million vs. 48 million) and
December (70 million vs. 74.8 million), despite an extra week in September and
December because of the leap year.

"As the (10th-anniversary iPhone) nears, expect an air pocket in iPhone 7
sales," Zino says.

For now, however, Apple fans can't get their new iPhones fast enough.

In the first 48 hours of online availability, 55% of those who bought the new
model opted for the Plus.

Nearly 70% of iPhone 7 buyers chose models in black shades, according to a
report on purchase data released Thursday morning by market researcher Slice
Intelligence.

Anticipated demand for the water-resistant phones sent Apple shares up 3.4%
Thursday to $115.57, capping a four-day surge that has lifted the stock 12%.
