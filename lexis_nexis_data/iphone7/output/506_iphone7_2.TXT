hour before the company's iPhone 7 launch event by revealing the phone in a
specialised page dedicated to iPhone 7 accessories.

The image includes an iPhone with the rumored dual back-facing camera alongside
a link for Bluetooth headphones, which likely confirms the long rumored removal
of the headphone jack in the upcoming handset.
