Earlier, ending round-the-clock rumours that had sent the world of technology
into a tizzy for quite some time now, Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled stunning
devices at the jam-packed Bill Graham Civic Auditorium here.

"iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus dramatically improve every aspect of the iPhone
experience, reaching a new level of innovation and precision to make this the
best iPhone we have ever made," said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice
president of Worldwide Marketing.

"The completely redesigned cameras shoot incredible photos and videos day or
night, the A10 Fusion chip is the most powerful chip on any smartphone while
delivering the best battery life ever in an iPhone, and an entirely new stereo
speaker system provides twice the sound, all within the first water and dust
resistant iPhone," he told the gathering.

The 12MP camera includes optical image stabilisation on both iPhone 7 and iPhone
7 Plus, and a larger AE'/1.8 aperture and 6-element lens enable brighter, more
detailed photos and videos.

"iPhone 7 Plus features the same 12-megapixel wide angle camera as iPhone 7 and
adds a 12-megapixel telephoto camera that together offer optical zoom at two
times and up to 10 times digital zoom for photos," the company announced.

Coming later this year, the dual 12-megapixel cameras also enable a new
depth-of-field effect, using both cameras on iPhone 7 Plus to capture images.

Sophisticated technology including machine learning separates the background
from the foreground to achieve amazing portraits, once possible only with DSLR
cameras, the company said.
