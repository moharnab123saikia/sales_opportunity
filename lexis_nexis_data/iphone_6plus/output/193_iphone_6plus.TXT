pictures clicked with the device are turning out, we have some good news.

Apple has acknowledged that in a small percentage of iPhone 6 Plus devices, the
rear camera has a component that may fail causing photos to look blurry. The
company has started 'iSight Camera Replacement Program for iPhone 6 Plus' under
which it will replace the camera free of charge for eligible devices. TOI Tech
has independently verified that Indian iPhone 6 Plus owners with eligible
devices can also get the camera module of their device replaced.

Apple says the affected units fall into a limited serial number range and were
sold primarily between September 2014 and January 2015. If your iPhone 6 Plus
camera is taking blurry pictures, you can check whether it is eligible by
entering its serial number on Apple's.

In case it is eligible for repair, you can locate an Apple Authorized Service
Provider to have the iSight camera replaced.

Apple clarifies that the iPhone will be examined prior to any service to verify
that it is eligible for this program and in working order. "If the iPhone 6 Plus
has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the camera replacement,
that issue will need to be resolved prior to service. In some cases, there may
be a cost associated with the repair," it adds.

Apple may restrict or limit repair to the original country of purchase so the
service centre may not repair the phone if you purchased it from another
country.
