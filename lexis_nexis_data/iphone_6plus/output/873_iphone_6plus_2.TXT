users have got all the reasons to celebrate. After Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance
Jio said it would offer free voice calls, 20GB data and unlimited SMS for one
year worth Rs 18,000 to all new iPhone users on its network, Airtel too joined
the race offering iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus users 10 GB free 4G/3G data per
month for one year with any Airtel Infinity post-paid plan.

The Jio offer is not restricted only to newly launched iPhone 7 and 7-Plus and
would also be valid on iPhone 6, 6-Plus, 6S-Plus, SE.

The latest edition of the iPhone was launched in India yesterday across multiple
platforms -- Apple resellers, Flipkart, Snapdeal and Tata Cliq. Most of these
companies are bundling in offers to woo customers in the world's second largest
telecom market.

Snapdeal has teamed up with American Express to offer the latter's card members
a discount of Rs 10,000 on the purchase of the device. Flipkart also said it was
priming itself to start deliveries. Telecom companies have also not been behind
in lining up lucrative incentives for iphone users post the the launch of the
iphone 7.

Now with such sweeteners being offered by these telecom companies, it will be
worth noting which of them aces the iPhone user market.
