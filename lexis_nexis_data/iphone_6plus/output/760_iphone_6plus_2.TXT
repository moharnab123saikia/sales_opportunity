Apple hasn't had much good fortune with it's latest release. On the heels of
BendGate, multiple iOS 8 bugs, dodgy updates and issues that are enough to cause
some Apple users to rip their hair out, the latest gadget seems to be doing the
job for them. According to reports from 9to5 mac it appears the seam gaps
between the iPhone 6 Plus' glass and aluminium casing can snag and yank out a
user's hair during calls. Yikes! As New York Magazine notes: "long-haired Steve
Jobs would have never let this happen." But before you consider a move to a
Samsung, be aware the Galaxy Note4 has it's own share of hair-tweezing problems.

Apple has yet to comment on the random hair and beard cuts their new device is
offering its users.

Some Twitter users wondering if "testers were mainly bald guys", others are
quick to crack a joke

iPhone 6/iPhone 6 Plus users in UAE, have you faced similar issues with your

none of the issues that have plagued the latest Apple release? Why do you think
Apple has faced so many issues recently? Sound off below and let us know.
