India.

Saturday, September 13, 2014: Customers and ardent fans of Apple devices are
already quite delighted with the latest launch of their favourite brand - iPhone
6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Now they have some more reason to rejoice as Apple's
flagship smartphone of 2013, iPhone 5S is going to undergo an "official" price
cut in India.

Both the 16GB and 32GB versions of iPhone 5S will be very much available in
markets, along with iPhone 5C 8GB. But the revised prices were not announced at
the recent Apple event. A tweet from Mumbai-based Mahesh Telecom has announced
that the two iPhone 5S variants will have a price cut, ahead of launch of iPhone
6 and iPhone 6 Plus in India.

The tweet says, iPhone 5S 16GB will cost Rs 44,500 instead of Rs 53,500 and the
32GB variant will be available at Rs 49,500 instead of Rs 62,500, as mentioned
in The Times of India. But the online price is lesser for iPhone 5S. Amazon.in
is retailing the 16GB version at Rs 34,999 and Flipkart at Rs 36,000. The online
price of 32GB version is Rs 56,000, which is expected to come down after the
price cut.

No word has been spread yet about a buyback offer for iPhone 5S, as happened for
iPhone 5C last year. Apple India has removed the iPhone 6 launch date, which was
earlier mentioned as 17 October, following 26 September. Till now, no official
statement has been released about when iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus will get
launched in India.
