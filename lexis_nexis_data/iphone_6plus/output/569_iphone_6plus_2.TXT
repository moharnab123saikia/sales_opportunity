

Apple on Monday said it had received record pre-orders for its new iPhone
models, and that some customers will have to wait for the larger-screen versions
of the smartphones.

Demand for the new iPhones exceeds the initial pre-order supply and while a
significant amount will be delivered to customers beginning on Friday and
throughout September, many iPhone pre-orders are scheduled to be delivered in
October," Apple said in a statement.

Apple last week unveiled the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, in a move aimed at
satisfying consumer preference for bigger smartphone displays.

The announcement means Apple may see shortages and long lines at its retail
stores when sales begin on Friday.

Pre-orders for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus set a new record for Apple, and we
can't wait to get our best iPhones yet into the hands of customers starting this
Friday," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the statement.

Sales are set to open at 8am local time in the US, Australia, Canada, France,
Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and Britain. Some 20 more
countries will get the iPhone September 26.

Some of the new iPhones will also be available from carriers and other
retailers.

Apple last Tuesday unveiled its first smartwatch and two large-screen versions
of the iPhone, in a move to recapture its role as a trend-setter.

Apple added in a new mobile wallet that will allow consumers to simply tap their
phones to pay retailers.

New iPhone 6 models boost screen sizes in what some see as the company catching
up to a phablet" trend combining features of smartphones and tablets.

The frenzy at Apple's website on Friday indicated that in the eyes of myriad
iPhone lovers, bigger is indeed better.

Apple's main rival Samsung has long had a range of larger handsets and has tried
to market a smartwatch of its own.

The iPhone 6 will have a screen of 4.7 inches and the 6-Plus will be 5.5 inches,
allowing Apple to adapt to consumers' apparent preference for bigger displays.
