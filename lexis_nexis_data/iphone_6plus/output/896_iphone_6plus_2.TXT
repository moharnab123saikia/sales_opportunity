with allegations that it bends easily. The company said that only nine people
had complained about a bent smartphone. It said that the iPhone 6 Plus passed
stress tests. "With normal use a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through
our first six days of sale, nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent
iPhone 6 Plus," said spokesman Adam Howorth.
