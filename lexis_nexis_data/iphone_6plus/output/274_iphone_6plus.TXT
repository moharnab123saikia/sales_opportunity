

With the recent arrival of the new and larger iPhone 6 Plus, along with the
consternation it has caused among users unable to stick the thing in their
pockets, the fashion industry is agonizing over nothing short of the future of
pants.

As Yohana Desta at Mashable.com puts it, this is a very sobering moment for the
makers of khaki, cargo and capris:

Along with Samsung's mammoth Galaxy phones, Apple's phablet mega-sized phone is
starting to look like the future of mobile tech.

That's bad news for your pants. Gone are the days of casually stuffing your
palm-sized phone in your pocket. Phablets are too big for such a trend, causing
people to worry: Where do we put our phones now?

The New York Post summed it up this way:

Thinking about splurging on a new iPhone 6 Plus? You may want to make sure it
fits in your pocket first.

last month, retailers are considering enlarging the pocket sizes on pants to
accommodate the 5.5-inch "phablet."

In response, a slew of clothing designers have been brainstorming among
themselves to create pants that can accommodate the larger phones. Desta
collected this spellbinding list of who's doing what to solve the Great
Phablet/Pants Crisis of 2014:
