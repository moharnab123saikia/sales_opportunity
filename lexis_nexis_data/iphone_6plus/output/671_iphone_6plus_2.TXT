phablet, the iPhone 6 Plus.

In fact, according to Digitimes, the company is in the process of adjusting
supply chain ratios so that more examples of the oversized smartphone arrive in
the shops to meet better-than-expected customer demand.

The publication's supply chain sources suggest that Apple initially played it
safe with production of the phablet, expecting to sell lower numbers and as a
result it could take some time for new inventory to hit the shelves.

The iPhone 6 Plus boasts a 5.5-inch HD display and was recently at the eye of a
Twitter storm over an apparent tendency to bend when carried in a rear pocket.
Bendgate generated a host of critical pieces, a number of YouTube videos and
digs disguised as jokes from Apple's main competitors.

However, Apple revealed that only nine people had so far complained to the
company that their phablet had bent and a Consumer Reports investigation into
the matter found that the iPhone 6 Plus was less likely to bend under pressure
than the iPhone 6 or the iPhone 5.

However, now that Bendgate has died down, a new Twitter-powered controversy is
being whipped up -- "Beardgate." It turns out that the tiny seam where the
phone's display meets the body can double up as an impromptu razor or set of
tweezers.

A number of users have discovered that holding the device up to their face to
take a call results in getting whiskers yanked from their faces. Meanwhile
female users are finding that the rear camera extrusion is tangling with their
hair when making calls.
