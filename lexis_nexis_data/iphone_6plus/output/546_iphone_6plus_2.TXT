takes Lumia 1020, HTC One M8 and Moto X to bend test.

Unbox Therapy posted the 'Iphone 6 Plus Bend Test' video yesterday on YouTube
showing how the iPhone 6 plus bends on applying a little pressure on the phone.

This resulted in lot of reaction on Twitter, Facebook and in news portals. So,
this time the channel has picked the best from 3 other competitors to for a bend
test.

Here are the results of this test.

Apple iPhone 6: This phone refused to bend. The glue that sticks the display
screen to the phone body seems as coming out which can be put back easily. This
is considerably better than the iPhone 6 Plus.

HTC One M8: The phone made a 'tuck' sound and the glue comes loose near the
screen, but the phone is sturdy enough not to bend.

2nd Generation Moto X: This device turned out to be rigid and solid block of
phone. No bending, no affect of pressure on the phone.

The phone this week launched in India as the successor of Moto X.

Nokia Lumia 1020: The phone gave a cracking sound, but it was nothing to fear
about. The phone is rock solid and is not affected by the pressure.
