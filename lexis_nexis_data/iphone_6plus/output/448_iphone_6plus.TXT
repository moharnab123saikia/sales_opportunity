handsets in the first weekend after their launch (James Dean writes).

Sales of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus comfortably beat the record of ten million
iPhone 6 and 6 Plus handsets sold during launch weekend - defined by Apple as
the first three days of sales - in September last year.

Unlike last year, China featured among iPhone launch countries this year. Daniel
Ives, a senior analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said that Chinese sales
appeared to be "white hot".

The iPhone is by far the biggest part of Apple's business, with sales accounting
for nearly two thirds of revenue in the most recent quarter.

Apple shares touched nearly $135 in April amid soaring optimism about iPhone 6
and 6 Plus sales. They were trading down by 1.5 per cent at $113 yesterday
afternoon.

IHS Technology predicts that Apple will sell 236 million iPhones this year, up
by nearly a quarter on last year. However, Ian Fogg, an IHS analyst, suggested
that Apple could have trouble sustaining momentum next year. "Apple is going to
have to find a way to reinvent the iPhone and it is hard to find something that
is radically new," he said.

During the launch weekend this year, Apple sold the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in 12
countries with a combined population in excess of two billion, according to Walt
Piecyk, of BTIG.

The upgraded iPhones feature touchscreens that detect how hard they are being
pressed, which opens up new ways of navigating.
