

APPLE has introduced a new bigger iPhone for the first time, called the iPhone 6
Plus.

At an event in California last night, CEO Tim Cook said: "Today we're launching
the biggest advancement in the history of iPhone."

The new iPhone 6 Plus comes with a 5.5-inch screen, compared to the four-inch
screen of the current generation iPhone 5s. Apple also introduced the iPhone 6,
which is also larger, now coming with a 4.7-inch screen. Both devices also have
what Apple call "ion-strengthened glass" screens. The larger of the two new
devices, the 6 Plus, also allows for apps such as Messages and Mail to be
displayed in landscape orientation for the first time.
