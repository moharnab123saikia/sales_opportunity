American Express today announces availability in Apple Pay[TM], the easy, safe
and private way to pay with iPhone速 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad速 Air 2 and iPad mini
3. Apple Pay will be available for eligible U.S. Consumer and OPEN American
Express速 Card Members.


Apple Pay allows American Express Card Members to seamlessly add their eligible
Card and pay with their mobile device at contactless merchants in stores or
directly within participating apps that accept American Express. When paying
with Apple Pay, Card Members will continue to receive all of the protection,
service and benefits offered by American Express. After downloading iOS 8.1,
Card Members can go to the Apple速 Passbook app to get started. If a Card Member
already has an eligible American Express Card on file with iTunes, they only
need to type in the Security Code - or they can simply choose to add a new
American Express Card.
Apple Pay will begin rollout in the U.S. starting Monday, October 20, 2014, with
iOS 8.1. Apple Pay works in stores with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Apple Pay is
also available to pay for physical goods and services in participating apps with
iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3.
