have become warped after being in their pockets for long periods of time. The
whole debacle is being called #bendgate.

Unlike LG s bendy G FLEX and numerous other bendy phones that came out this
year, the iPhone 6 was not made to bend. MacRumors, which first reported on the
issue, said  a small but growing number  of iPhone 6 Plus owners had reported in
their forums that their phone had been bent after carrying the device in their
pockets. In one example, a new 6 Plus was bent during a day of  dancing, dining,
and driving to a wedding . Russell Holly, a reporter for Geek.com, said he had
also experienced the issue.  Shortly after reading these reports I checked out
my own iPhone 6 and discovered a similar   but significantly less noticeable
effect,  he said.  Much like these other reports, my phone had been in my front
pocket for an extended period of time while I was driving.  iPhone 6 Plus owners
are also being warned online against bending their phones back into shape due to
the risk of its screen cracking. More than 10m Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models,
a record for a new model, were sold in the three days after the phones went on
sale. The new models are onsale in Ireland from tomorrow. A year ago, Apple said
it had sold 9m of the then-new iPhone 5C and 5S models. Chief executive Tim Cook
said demand for the phones had exceeded the company s expectations. Besides
larger screens, the new phones offer faster performance and a wireless chip for
making credit card payments.
