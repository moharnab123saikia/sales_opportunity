to make simple and secure payments at more than 700,000 businesses across the
United States and select iOS apps.

"We're thrilled to add Apple Pay to the fast-growing range of digital banking
services we offer banking customers," said Matthew D. Lehman, senior vice
president and head of digital banking.

Using their iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus mobile devices running iOS 8.1 or later,
KeyBank customers can use Apple Pay, a mobile payments solution, to  complete
credit or debit card transactions without revealing their card information.
Completing a transaction is easy; customers simply hold their iPhone 6 or iPhone
6 Plus near a contactless reader with their finger on the Touch ID fingerprint
sensor.

KeyBank customers can also make in-app purchases with either the iPhone 6,
iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3 mobile devices. Visit Key.com for more

banking services.

KeyBank places a high priority on helping to protect clients' financial assets
and personal identification. Stringent security measures are in play from the
time a client adds their KeyBank credit and debit cards to their Passbook to
using Apple Pay to make transactions, either with a merchant or online.

"We use a detailed identity and verification protocol whenever we observe
factors that might indicate attempted fraud when KeyBank cards are being added
to Apple Pay," Lehman said.

He said adding Apple Pay to KeyBank's digital banking program is part of a
customer-focused plan that redefines the entire user experience across all
digital platforms to give KeyBank customers the access and control they want.

"We have an ongoing commitment to identifying digital banking solutions, such as
Apple Pay, that put our customers in control," Lehman said. "We are committed to
helping our customers feel confident in the decisions they make about their
finances today and decisions they make for their financial future."

Lehman added that KeyBank has seen double-digit year-over-year growth in mobile
and in online acquisition.

"It's exciting to see our customers' enthusiastic response each time we
introduce a new digital capability," he said.
