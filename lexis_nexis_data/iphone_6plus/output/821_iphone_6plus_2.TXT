

Apple has defended itself against reports that its largest iPhone bends easily
in people's pockets, saying warping is "extremely rare" through normal use.

Since going on sale this week, Apple said only nine customers had contacted the
company about a bent iPhone 6 Plus - the larger and more expensive of its two
new iPhones. Apple said both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus passed a series of
tests meant to check the products' strength and durability through everyday use.

Apple is addressing reports that the new iPhone 6 Plus was bending when people
sat with the phone in their pockets. Videos of people bending the jumbo-sized
iPhone with their hands quickly made the rounds on social media.

Apple said it sold more than 10 million of the new phones in the first three
days. - Sapa-AFP
