expected to dismantle it with a screwdriver.

Yet enthusiasts from Melbourne, Australia, have already prised apart an iPhone 6
Plus to get a look at the inner components.

Apple's latest smartphone went on sale alongside the iPhone 6 yesterday morning,
causing queues of around 1,000 people outside the company's Covent Garden store
in London.

In a "teardown", repair website www.iFixit.com removed the screen to reveal that
Apple uses chips from Qualcomm, Skyworks Solutions and Avago Technologies, among
others, in its new device. The team also took a closer look at the phone's 8
megapixel camera, hefty battery and vibrator assembly component.

Notoriously secretive, Apple refuses to name its components' suppliers and
forbids them from discussing Apple-related matters with the press or investors.

The 5.5-inch device is the largest iPhone the company has produced to date, and
costs between £619 and £789, while the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 costs between £539 and
£699. All configurations are available in silver, gold and space grey. Apple
received more than four million pre-orders for its new phone within 24 hours, a
record for the company. Demand for both models exceeded supply, meaning online
customers may have to wait four weeks to receive their new phone.

CAMERA

The rear-facing 8MP iSight camera uses optical image stabilisation and "Focus
Pixel" phase-detection autofocus technology - the first iPhone to do so

SCREEN

The 5.5inch screen (measured diagonally) is the largest screen on an iPhone to
date, and is made of ion-strengthened glass

BATTERY

The 43gram battery is considerably larger than its predecessor the iPhone 5s',
and results in a significantly longer battery life, the company has said

VIBRATOR ASSEMBLY

The vibrator assembly is responsible for the vibrations which accompany incoming
calls, texts and other notifications. It contains copper coils, arranged to
create alternating magnetic fields
