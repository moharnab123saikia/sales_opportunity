Friday the launch of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in Pakistan.

The popular smart phones will be made available to consumers under the banner of
the telecom service provider from Dec 11 this year.

Customers will be able to register online for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus from
Nov 28 at the company's website, a press statement said.

This is the first time that Apple has collaborated with a Pakistani
telecommunication provider for the launch of its signature Smartphone.

Apple is considered one of the biggest names in technologyrelated products and
is widely believed to be the world's secondlargest information technology
company.

Despite the phone's official unavailability in the country, iPhone enjoys a
large fan base in Pakistan, with many users already awaiting the entry of the
new product.

iPhone 6 was first officially introduced two months ago in the United States.
