in India, and Reliance Communication seems to be already gearing up to launch
its contract-plans for the newest iPhones. RCom has listed the Zero Plans for
Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on its website, (spotted by TelecomTalk).

RCom had introduced the Zero Plan last year with the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C, in
which it allows users to own an iPhone under two-year contract, with a fixed
monthly rental plan for 24 months.

Under the Zero Plan contract, a user can own an iPhone 6 with an Rs 3,099
monthly rental for each month for two years, or can buy the iPhone 6 Plus on a
two-year contract with an Rs 3,599 monthly plan.

The Zero Plan contract allows users to make free unlimited voice calls (local
and roaming) and texts, and access free unlimited data, without any additional
bills for those 24 months of contract period.

These services will be included in the fixed monthly payment under the contract,
depending on variant of the iPhone.

The company has not given any information on the amount of down payment required
for the 64GB and 128GB variants of the phones.
