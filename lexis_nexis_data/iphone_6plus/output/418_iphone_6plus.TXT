Apple (http://indianexpress.com/tag/apple/) has started iSight camera
replacement for a small percentage of iPhone 6 Plus devices sold between
September 2014 and January 2015. According to Apple
(http://www.apple.com/in/support/iphone6plus-isightcamera/), "the iSight camera
has a component that may fail causing your photos to look blurry."

The affected iPhone 6 Plus fall into a limited serial number range and Apple
(http://indianexpress.com/tag/apple/) will replace affected device's iSight
camera free of charge. Users can type their iPhone serial number here to check
if their phone (http://www.apple.com/support/iphone6plus-isightcamera/)is
eligible for replacement.

The affected iPhone can be submitted at any authorised Apple
(http://indianexpress.com/tag/apple/) service provider for replacement upon
inspection to verify the eligibility of device under the replacement program.

Apple (http://indianexpress.com/tag/apple/) also points out that in case an
iPhone 6 Plus has other damages as well, "such as a cracked screen which impairs
the camera replacement," then you will have to pay up to fix that, so that the
camera issue can be resolved.
