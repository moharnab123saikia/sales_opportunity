By tbreak Staff -



It is finally official. The Samsung Galaxy S7 will be launching on Sunday,

February 21, 2016.



Samsung recently sent out invites to members of the press for its February 21

Unpacked 2016 event, where we can see for sure the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. The

event will start at 7PM Barcelona time, and will be on the same day that LG

plans to reveal the G5, ahead of the MWC 2016, which brings it to two flagships

on one day.



The invite in itself was quite cryptic, but Samsung also released a short teaser

clip which featured its Gear VR headset. It is a high possibility that the

concepts of Virtual Reality will be incorporated somehow into the launch of the

event, or probably Samsung might announce something new for the Samsung Galaxy

Gear VR as well.



According to previous rumors, we can expect the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge to

be completely black and can be expected to release on the 11th of March in US

and Europe markets. If the rumors are true, Samsung would release the Galaxy S7

early, as compared to last year's S6 and S6 Edge which released almost a month

later. There are also rumors of a third version, the Galaxy S7 Plus, but it is

yet to be confirmed. As of now, we have only the 5.1 inch Galaxy S7 and the Edge

variant at 5.5 inch.



Other than Samsung, we can expect to see devices from LG and Huawei during MWC.
