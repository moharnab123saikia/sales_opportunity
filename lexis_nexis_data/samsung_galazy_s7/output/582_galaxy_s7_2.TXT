Sharper, snappier S7 makes a splash

When the white Galaxy S7 test unit landed on my desk, I thought it was the

iPhone 6. To the naked eye, the build and shape look so similarto the Apple that

if not for Samsung's rectangular home button, I'd say the two units were

identical. Samsung has even adopted the same SIM card slot that you need a

removal tool (paper clip) to open.



But that is probably where the similarities end. The just-released S7 is

actually slightly larger in size (142.4mm x 69.6mm x 7.9mm) and with a sturdy

housing made of toughened glass and metal weighs in at 152 grams. It feels

fantastic in the hand.



Its specifications are similar to those of the S7 Edge (reviewed above), but we

did put its camera, waterproof claim and battery tothe test.



I have never liked the Samsung phone camera as it produces, in my opinion,

oversaturated images with exaggerated vibrancy. The S7 camera seems to have

corrected that, with colours looking more natural, but the most impressive of

all is its ability to take excellent photos in low-light conditions. You can do

so much with the camera (finally a hyperlapse option), and that alone can keep

you entertained for hours.



The only drawback - and I am not sure whether it was just my test unit - is that

on one occasion, after I took a few snaps, the camera started to make strange

crackling noises and I had to quit the application. But that happened only once

during the week I used the phone.



Regarding battery power, one charge lasts several days with mild usage: camera,

internet surfing with no gaming.



And finally we put the phone under a running tap before submerging it in a

container and Ziploc bag full of water. It passed both these tests with flying

colours. Kevin Kwong
