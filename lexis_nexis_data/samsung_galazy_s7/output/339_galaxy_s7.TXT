Samsung has unveiled its latest Galaxy S7 flagship smartphones, bringing back

favourite features as it aims to close out the top-end of the Android market.



The new Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android smartphones, unveiled in Barcelona

at Mobile World Congress, build on the design of last year's popular S6 versions

but add IP68 waterproofing and a microSD card slot - two features the Korean

company had become known for until 2015.



The Galaxy S7 has a flat 5.1in screen but a curved glass back, adding to the

ergonomics. The larger Galaxy S7 Edge has a 5.5in screen that is curved at the

left and right-hand edges and has minimal bezels either side of the screen

making it one of the most narrow phablets available.



They both run the latest version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, have 4GB of Ram for

improved multitasking and 30% more powerful processors with "thermal spreader"

water-cooling technology to avoid the phones overheating.



Both smartphones also have significantly larger batteries, which promise to

avoid the need to constantly be in search of a power point. The company has also

put in tools to help save battery power while gaming, that also allow users to

capture footage of their gaming sessions similar to the way console gamers can.



Samsung is also pushing an always-on display setting that uses the screen's

AMOLED display to light a minimal graphic showing the time, date or other

user-configurable information. The company claims the feature will consume less

than 1% battery per hour.



The phones also have a new, slimmer 12-megapixel camera designed with low-light

photography in mind. It uses larger 1.4um pixels and a lens with an f-stop of

1.7 to let 25% more light into the sensor, as well as a very fast autofocus

system, to help prevent grainy or blurred photos.



Samsung, the world's largest smartphone manufacturer, is locked in a battle over

the floating votes of smartphone buyers with Apple in most developed markets.



The company is betting on battery, waterproofing and camera enhancements to

entice buyers, while attempting to expand the larger ecosystem around the

smartphone.



Rory O'Neill, head of brand and product marketing for Samsung said: "The UK

smartphone market has matured. Those under 25 now choose a smartphone with

emphasis on its interaction with other services and devices. We have to do more

than just produce a smartphone, we have to redefine what a phone can do."



Part of that push will be Samsung's Internet of Things system called

SmartThings, plus connections to the company's televisions, home audio systems,

cameras and its virtual reality headset made in partnership with Facebook's

Oculus Rift.



Samsung also said it intended to bring its mobile phone contactless payments

system currently available in the US and South Korea, Samsung Pay, to six more

markets in 2016, including the UK, Spain, Australia, Brazil, China and

Singapore.



Samsung also launched a 360-degree camera, the Gear 360, which resembles a small

ball only slightly bigger than a golf ball. It has two 180-degree fish-eye

lenses, can be remotely controlled by a Samsung phone and can stream video or

30-megapixel photos in real time.
