A leaked video destined for Indonesia firms up rumors that Samsung's next Galaxy

S7 smartphone will be waterproof and feature wireless charging.



A week before its official unveiling at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, an

unlisted video spot by Samsung has been making the rounds on the internet.



Indonesian archer Dellie Threesyadinda stars in the ad and shows off the

features of the upcoming phone, placing it on a wireless charging pad and using

it during a downpour.



The Galaxy S7 also features a dual-edged display.



A website launched in Indonesia also hints at increased security and privacy;

improved voice recognition capabilities; and low-light photography.
