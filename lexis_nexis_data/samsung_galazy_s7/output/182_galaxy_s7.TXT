Samsung's flagship phones Galaxy S7 is expected to launch in first quarter of

2016 and will be sold in the United States and China, reported South Korea's

Electronic Times.



Tuesday, October 06, 2015: Samsung's flagship phones Galaxy S7 is expected to

launch in first quarter of 2016 and will be sold in the United States and China,

reported South Korea's Electronic Times.



However, Samsung avoided to comment on these "rumours" or "speculation".



Informing about S7's processor part, the daily said, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820

chips will be used by Samsung for the Galaxy S7 phones. The smartphones are

expected to launch anywhere between January and March of 2016 and will be sold

in the United States and China. In other markets, Galaxy S7 phones will be

powered by Samsung's own Exynos processors, Electronic Times said.



This year, for the flagship Galaxy S6 smartphones and Galaxy Note, the South

Korean mobile giant, Samsung, used only its Exynos processors, giving a major

blow to the U.S. chipmaker.



In August, for the Galaxy S6 Edge+ and Galaxy Note 5, the company used its own

Exynos processors and not the Qualcomm's Snapdragon ones. They are powered by a

64-bit octa-core Exynos 7420 SoC with four Cortex-A57 cores clocked at 2.1GHz,

and four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.5GHz. The phones also powered with

4GBRAM.



But Samsung said earlier in 2015 that it could opt to use Qualcomm chips for the

future models.
