SMARTPHONE CAMERAS nowadays are better than ever. In fact, Samsung Electronics

says, they're so good, they've practically rendered standard point-and-shoot

cameras obsolete. But, can a phone replace a professional single-lens reflex

(SLR) camera?



Samsung decided to put its Galaxy S7 Edge to that test, with the hope users will

learn to see beyond megapixel count to judge image quality.



"Basically, people think the higher the megapixel count, the better the

quality," Samsung said in a recent press release. "It does not take into

consideration the other factors that make for great cameras such as aperture,

shutter speed, and fast auto-focus, just to name a few."



Samsung commissioned two professional fashion photographers, BJ Pascual and Mark

Nicdao, to photograph models Georgina Wilson-Burnand and Solenn Heussaff with

just the Galaxy S7 Edge. Mr. Pascual shot Ms. Wilson- Burnand in low light while

Mr. Nicdao photographed Ms. Heussaff underwater.



"I was both hesitant and thrilled when I was first offered the project," Mr.

Nicdao was quoted saying in the press release. "First, I haven't done an

underwater shoot, and second, I've never done a fashion shoot with just a

smartphone. Combining both was a real challenge."



Ms. Heussaff, for her part, is no stranger to underwater shoots or to Samsung,

but she also had her doubts. "With just a smartphone? I honestly thought people

would just take behind-the-scenes [shots] with it; I did not expect the [phone]

to be used as the main camera... because you'd always need the specs to be

really high for these things," she was quoted saying.



Mr. Pascual shared his own misgivings: "I was really skeptical at first because

I've never done a professional shoot before with just a smartphone. [Also,] the

setup had to be dark, and photos can get really grainy."



But when both photographers and models saw the shots they took with the Galaxy

S7 Edge, "all the initial hesitation they felt quickly dissipated," Samsung said

in its press release.



"I think it's about time that we take smartphone cameras seriously," Mr. Pascual

was quoted saying.



Last Friday, May 13, Samsung put the resulting photos in a photo exhibit called

"Dark Blue", at the Green Sun in Makati. The collection "Own the Night" featured

Mr. Pascual's photos of Ms. Wilson-Burnand, while "Into the Blue" was composed

of Mr. Nicdao's shots of Ms. Heussaff.



"It's a different process since it was faster and simpler. But... I think it

gives skeptics... a chance to see that Samsung knows what they're talking

about," Ms. Wilson-Burnand was quoted saying.



Mr. Nicdao, said to be impressed by the phone, was quoted saying: "There's this

unprecedented shift that's happening in photography... driven by more people

having access to the tools that allow them to find their voice. If smartphone

brands, such as Samsung, are able to help them find their passion and tap into

their talent, it's at least worth putting their claim to the test."



Chad Sotelo, Samsung Electronics Philippines Corp. corporate marketing head,

expressed a similar thought.



"Quality is important, but so is enthusiasm to explore new things. This was

certainly a daring move and a new experience for us, but it just highlights how

technology can really be a game changer. Capturing a great picture using a

smartphone is no less rewarding than if you had taken it using a DSLR (digital

SLR)," he was quoted saying.
