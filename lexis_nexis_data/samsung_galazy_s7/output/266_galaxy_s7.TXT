Sri Lanka, March 20 -- Two Samsung smartphones, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge

was launched at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo last week.



"In our relentless search for a device that embodies the future of mobility, the

Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge innovate in the areas of performance and design to

create a device that re-imagines what a smartphone can be," Managing Director,

Samsung Electronics, Sri Lanka, Youngmin Shin said.



The S7s were shipped to Sri Lanka a month after the world first caught a glimpse

of the device at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and is expected to reach

customers through local partners.



Customers making pre-orders will receive a wireless charger and a clear phone

cover with their purchase.



"The S7 come in black or gold, while the S7 Edge come in black, gold, or silver

options. The smartphones are powered by meaningful innovations that will make

the lives of people better," he said.



Shin said Samsung Research and Development (R&D) in Southwest Asia played a

significant role in the development of the new devices, with a platform to cater

to the needs of premium users in Sri Lanka with Samsung Concierge.



The consumer engagement platform has been customised to offer valuable services

such as dedicated VIP hotline, dedicated email support with 24-hour response

time, dedicated service counter at service centers in Colombo, Kandy and Galle.



The R&D team also contributed to developing the Motion Panorama feature that

will enable consumers to capture live events in detail by capturing every piece

of dynamic motion.



The Spotlight Selfie feature that provides consumers a studio-like environment

with virtual light source, was developed by engineers in Southwest Asia.



The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge use a new 3D thermoforming process, which brings metal

and glass together for an apparent seamless view.



The devices also feature a 'Always on Display' which allows users to easily

check for updates, without having to worry about unlocking the phone.
