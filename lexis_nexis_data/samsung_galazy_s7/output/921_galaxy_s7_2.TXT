Can Samsung's Note 7 Survive Being Frozen in Ice? A 100-Foot Drop?

When a new phone is released, it isn't long before "drop test" videos start

making their way to YouTube. In these videos, people-mostly gadget

reviewers-drop the new phone to see if it survives the fall.



A new video from GizmoSlip puts Samsung's new Galaxy Note 7 through what we can

only describe as "not your average drop test." The video's creators freeze the

phone inside a block of ice (for 23 hours) and then proceed to drop it 100 feet

onto concrete. Since the phone is marketed as water resistant (which we can

confirm-we dunked it in water when ditching our iPhone to try it for a week), it

should survive the freezing. But does it? And does it survive the fall?



This isn't GizmoSlip's first drop of this caliber. The team also froze the

Galaxy S7, iPhone 6S  and iPhone SE in ice and dropped them both 100 feet onto

concrete as well. The iPhone SE survived, but the iPhone 6s and Galaxy S7 did

not. The drop of the new Note, however, turned out to be Samsung's comeback. It

survived both the freezing and the fall. It turned on and was functioning

perfectly immediately, and the glass didn't even shatter a little bit.
