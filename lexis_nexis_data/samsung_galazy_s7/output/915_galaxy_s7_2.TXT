MISSISSAUGA, Ont. * Samsung has released Canadian details for the 10-country

recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, following reports that some of

their batteries have exploded or caught fire.



Samsung Electronics Canada says there has been no confirmed incident in this

country, but Canadian customers are eligible for a product exchange.



Samsung's parent company said last week that it would set up a product exchange

after it confirmed 35 cases of Note 7s that exploded or caught fire due to

defective batteries from one supplier. Owners of the phone in Canada can

exchange a recalled device for a new one of the same model.



The company says another option is to exchange a recalled device for a Galaxy S7

or Galaxy S7 Edge through the carrier or retailer that sold the device.



Samsung says Note 7 owners can initiate the exchange by visiting a

special-purpose website: CanadaNote7exchange.expertinquiry.com. It also has a

toll-free phone number: 1-800-517-3507. !@COPYRIGHT=Â© 2016 Telegraph-Journal
