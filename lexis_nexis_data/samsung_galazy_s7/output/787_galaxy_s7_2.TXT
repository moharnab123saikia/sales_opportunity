New Delhi, July 14 -- Zee Media Bureau/Rd. Alexander

 Leaks, rumours - they all got it right.





 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 will be launched on August 2 as rumoured and the South

Korean electronics giant has confirmed the same.

 The company wrote on its blogpost, "On August 2nd, Samsung Electronics will

unveil the Galaxy Note7".

 With the Note 7, Samsung will be skipping a number in its Note series - i.e.

the Note 6.

 Clarifying on this, Samsung gave a couple of reasons saying, "First, the Galaxy

Note7 will complement our Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, and unify our product

portfolio. Second, the Galaxy Note7 will minimize confusion about the latest

mobile technology from Samsung, and provide full alignment with Galaxy S

smartphone."

 About the Galaxy Note 7, the company said it was "a powerful instrument for

achievement and self-expression, and is made for those who want to get the most

from their phones - and their lives".

 "Galaxy Note7 will help people do more in work, at home and everywhere in

between. We can't wait to tell you more about it," Samsung added.

 As per recent leaks, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 will feature a 5.7-inch QHD

Super AMOLED display with 12MP Dual Pixel rear camera plus and IP68

certification.

 It will be supported by 4GB of RAM along with a 4000 mAh battery and run on

Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.

 The Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event will take place at 11:00 a.m. EDT (8:30 pm

IST) in New York on August 2, 2016, the company said.
