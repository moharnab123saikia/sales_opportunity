The future of technology looks brighter than ever before.



This message rang out loud and clear during the official launch of the Samsung

Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones at Hyde Park shopping centre, Johannesburg on

Thursday. Addressing guests and the media, Justine Hume, director of product

marketing at Samsung SA said the two new devices have grown even more

functional, with more personalisation abilities.



"The seamlessly connected devices expand what your phone can be, while the

meaningful partnerships redefine experiences you can have and the S7 is at the

centre of it," Hume said about its partnerships with the likes of Google Music

and Facebook.



The new features on the S7 and S7 Edge, include water/dust resistant design,

more camera pixels, high gaming performance, increased battery life and memory,

with the option to use a memory card or a second sim card.



Combined with a thinner bezel, the devices use a process known as 3D

thermoforming to shape the curved glass backing, making for a more comfortable

grip and feel.



One of Samsung's biggest selling points for both devices comes in the form of

the VR (virtual reality) headset, which allows users to watch video games,

movies and share content with others through the Facebook-owned Oculus

technology.



Available to Galaxy S7 purchases until this Friday, the chunky black box comes

packed with several games and a year's subscription to Netflix, all for free.



"Since the inception of S4 when we started thinking about this idea of phone

plus strategy, we took into account that while the phone itself might be

excellent, if it exists in isolation, it doesn't mean very much.



"Now, as you know, music streaming in South Africa is fast gaining traction and

we have seen a plethora of services coming to this market.



"However, I think if we are honest with ourselves we would agree we have very

limited representation from android and that is set to change.



"Samsung has signed an exclusive deal with Google music where S7 and Edge

customers will receive six-months-free Google  music streaming from the end of

this month. If you remember we are the first smartphone to introduce accidental

damage from handling and that will continue with the Edge 7."



While the average repair time for headsets takes about 14 days to six weeks, "we

thought we can't leave our S7 customers with that kind of experience because we

know your smartphone is an extension of your life and an extension of your

business. So with S7 we are striving to ensure that we can repair the customer's

handset within 1 hour," Hume said.
