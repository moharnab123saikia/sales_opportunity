It's no surprise that Samsung already has the Samsung Galaxy S7 on the tables.
Leaked details regarding its specifications, prices and its release date have
been flooding the Internet, and here is how it currently stands.

The Galaxy S7 may have the new Snapdragon 820 processor, which is a change from
the previous Exynos processors that Samsung used for its earlier devices. There
has been many rumors regarding Samsung testing the 820 for its S7 as well as
some prototypes leaking on Chinese websites. In terms of RAM, there will be two
variants. A LTE version with 4GB RAM and another with 3GB RAM. However, Samsung
recently launched its first DRAM chip which makes it possible for Smartphones to
have 6GB of RAM thatÂ runs 30 percent faster with 20 percent less power. It
wouldn't be a surprise if Samsung uses this in the S7 or a premium variant,
which will make it the fastest smartphone in the world. The S7 may have a 4K
display with Turtle Glass, Samsung's option to Corning's Gorilla Glass.

The release date of the S7 has been kept under wraps as of now. However, going
by Samsung's earlier patterns, the phone can be expected to released somewhere
between 22nd to 25th February, 2016 to match with the MWC. The S6 was launched
in 2015 at MWC and the S5 in 2014. In terms of price, the S7 might be quite high
when compared to the S6. If a 4K screen is used, then it might not be as high.
However, the price range should be within $650 - $700.
