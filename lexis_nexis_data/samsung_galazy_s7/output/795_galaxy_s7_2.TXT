devices as part of a global safety recall following reports of overheating
batteries that pose a fire hazard. Samsung Electronics Canada Inc. of
Mississauga, Ont., has advised consumers to return the phones to the stores
where they were bought. They can be exchanged for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge
phone, or customers can opt for a full refund. !@COPYRIGHT=Â© 2016 Postmedia
