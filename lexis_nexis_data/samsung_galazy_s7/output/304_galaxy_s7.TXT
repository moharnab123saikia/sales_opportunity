If you ever wanted to feel like an Olympic athlete, without ever having to work
for it, Samsung is here to help. Say hello to the new Galaxy S7 Edge Olympic
Games Limited Edition.

The new Olympic themed Galaxy S7 Edge comes with accents in colors of the
Olympic circles and custom themes and wallpapers as well. According to sources,
12,500 athletes attending the Summer Games in Brazil will receive the Galaxy S7
Edge Olympic Games Limited Edition as a gift. However, you dont have to be an
athlete to get it for yourself, as the 2016 units of the S7 Edge Olympic Edition
will be sold in select countries. These include Brazil, United States, China,
Germany and Korea.

In US the Galaxy S7 Edge Olympic Edition (32GB) is on sale for $840. This is a
$50 more than the regular model, but you also get a limited edition phone, so
its worth it. However, unlike the Batman themed version, the Olympic model does
not come with a VR headset.
