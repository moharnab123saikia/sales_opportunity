 Kansas: Sprint Corporation has issued the following Press release:







  Sprint (NYSE: S) today demonstrated speeds of more than 300 Mbps using the

Samsung Galaxy S7, one of the first devices on the market with hardware able to

support three-channel carrier aggregation capable of delivering real-world peak

speeds of more than 200 Mbps.











 Today Sprint uses two-channel carrier aggregation to deliver peak speeds of

more than 100 Mbps in more than 150 LTE Plus markets across the country. With

the availability of the Samsung Galaxy S7, Sprint and Samsung have begun testing

three-channel carrier aggregation to prepare for Sprint's future deployment in

Sprint's super-fast LTE Plus Network.







 Three-channel carrier aggregation is a feature of LTE-Advanced that bonds

together bands of spectrum to create wider channels and produce more capacity

and faster speeds on capable devices. Essentially it creates a wider lane that

allows more traffic to travel at higher rates. Today with two-channel carrier

aggregation Sprint uses 40MHz of spectrum on select 2.5GHz cell sites. With

three-channel carrier aggregation Sprint will utilize 60MHz of spectrum.







 "Our high-band 2.5GHz spectrum excels at moving high volumes of data at very

fast speeds. And while 60MHz of spectrum can deliver the kind of phenomenal

speeds shown today, we're just getting started," said Dr. John Saw, Sprint CTO.

"With holdings of more than 160MHz of 2.5GHz spectrum in the top 100 U.S.

markets, we have more capacity than any other carrier in the U.S. This is a

tremendous advantage, allowing us to keep adding the capacity and speed needed

to serve our customers' demand for data now and well into the future.

Two-channel carrier aggregation has already had a significant impact on our

network performance and we're excited to take it to the next level with

Samsung."







 Today Sprint is device testing three-channel carrier aggregation in its lab

located in Reston, Virginia, to evaluate overall performance, speed and

reliability using the Samsung Galaxy S7. The company expects to test new devices

as they become available in preparation for deployment of three-channel carrier

aggregation within the super-fast LTE Plus Network.
