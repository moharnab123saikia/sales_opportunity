A classaction lawsuit has been filed in Canada regarding Samsung Galaxy Note 7

phones, which were recalled last month following reports of overheating

batteries that pose a fire hazard.



The lawsuit against both the U.S. and Canadian divisions of Samsung was filed in

Ontario Superior Court by London, Ont.-based McKenzie Lake Lawyers, LLP.



The claim alleges Samsung was negligent because they knew or should have known

that the devices could harm consumers. The allegations have not been proven in

court.



The lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of Canadian residents who bought the Note

7, seeks damages and a declaration that the defendants' actions were false and

misleading and contravened the Consumer Protection Act and the Competition Act.



The South Korean electronics giant stopped making and selling the devices and

advised owners to turn them off and stop using them last month.



Samsung Electronics Canada Inc. says customers who return the phone can either

exchange it for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge, or receive a full refund.



The plaintiffs in the case are Hannah Shaheen of Burlington, Ont., and Daniel

Fuller, a Michigan resident in the process of moving to Burlington. While

returning from their honeymoon in the Turks and Caicos Islands, the couple says

they were forced to destroy and discard their Note 7 phones because they had

been banned from air transportation. They allege that in the process of

destroying the devices, one caught fire. Because they had been forced to destroy

the phones, Shaheen and Fuller lost all the personal information, photos, videos

and contacts that were on the devices.



The couple says they have not received any compensation from the company or a

replacement device.



"We believe that through this action, the defendants will be required to account

for their actions in bringing these devices to market," lawyer Matthew Baer said

in a statement.



"Canadians who owned these devices deserve to be properly compensated."
