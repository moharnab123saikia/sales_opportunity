forthcoming Galaxy S7 handset will come with a pressure-sensitive display as
well as a high-speed charging port.

According to the WSJ report, Samsung is also probably planning to introduce a
retina scanner for some models of the upcoming Galaxy S7 handset, which is
currently in production.

In addition, the report has also projected that Samsung will also launch a
curved-screen variant of the Galaxy S7 handset, on the lines of the company's
current-generation Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge flagship smartphones.

It is being speculated that the new Galaxy S7 handset will likely be announced
by Samsung on the day before 2016 Mobile World Congress, which will kick off in
Barcelona on February 21, 2016. The sales of the handset will probably begin in
mid-March.

Meanwhile, so far as the other speculations about the Galaxy S7 handset are
concerned, some last-week leaks have disclosed that the new handset will likely
be powered by a faster Snapdragon 820 processor, and will bring back the storage
expansion slot of the Galaxy S5 model. Moreover, some earlier reports have also
hinted that the starting price of the Galaxy S7 handset will probably be lowered
by Samsung up to 10 percent below that of the Galaxy S6.
