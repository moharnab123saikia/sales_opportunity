FERRARI RECALLS CARS FOR FUEL-LEAK RISKS

Ferrari North America is recalling some 2016 California T convertibles because
the vehicles may have an improper fuel line connection that could increase the
risk of a fire. The cars carry a price tag of $231,000 and up. Ferrari notified
the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration that California T
convertibles made between Sept. 8 and Nov. 11 this year have a low-pressure fuel
line that may not connect properly to the fuel pump feed pipe. That could result
in a fuel leak in the vehicle's engine compartment, which may increase the risk
of smoke or a fire.
