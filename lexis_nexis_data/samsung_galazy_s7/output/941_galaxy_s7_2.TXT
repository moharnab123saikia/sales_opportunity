Galaxy Note 6 is going to be the latest and greatest smartphone from Samsung's

Note lineup and naturally, its hardware will eclipse that present inside Galaxy

S7; the smartphone which is expected to be released during MWC 2016. Galaxy Note

5 was a remarkable handset in terms of physical specifications and software and

soon, Galaxy Note 6 is going to take its place. According to the hardware

specifications listed on the Chinese website Weibo, the upcoming phablet is

going to feature 6GB of RAM, which will be running at LPDDR4 speeds, and is the

bandwidth running inside the 'soon to be announced' Galaxy S7.



It is possible that Samsung slightly increases the screen of its upcoming

phablet because the source suggests that the screen size will be 5.8 inches.

Samsung will obviously be using the same Super AMOLED display that it has been

using for its mobile devices for such a long, and this one is not going to be an

exception. There is no mention of a microSD card slot, indicating that the

company might not implement such a feature, which is a terrible idea. Instead,

it states that the storage will be divided into two models; one 64GB and one

128GB model. While most several consumers can actually work with 64GB of

internal storage, there are some who love to carry around their entire media

collection inside the device, so for a an expandable storage feature to not be

present is a severe let-down.



The resolution is going to remain the same; 2560 x 1440 pixels. This is a great

approach, since increasing the number of pixels will obviously be detrimental

for the battery life. There is no news on which chipset is going to be present

inside Galaxy Note 6, but we suspect that it is going to be the Exynos 8890. As

for the rear camera sensor, Galaxy Note 6 is going to have a camera sensor

downgrade, but in the megapixel department only. As far as the sensor

performance goes, Samsung will be placing the best of what a smartphone can

accommodate inside its body.



If you read our review of Galaxy Note 5, you will know that the smartphone is

definitely a wonder to look at, hold and function, so there is no question that

the upcoming device will surpass its predecessor in every way we can possibly

imagine. While there is no release date mentioned, Samsung might host an event

for the month of September, which is the same month in which Apple will be

unveiling its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.



In short, it will definitely be a clash of smartphone titans, and we will keep

you posted on additional details in the future.
