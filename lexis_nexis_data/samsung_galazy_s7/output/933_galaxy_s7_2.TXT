Samsung Warns of Huge Loss From Recall of Galaxy Phone

SEOUL, South Korea -- Samsung Electronics said on Friday that it expected about

$3 billion in operating profits to evaporate over the next two quarters because

of its decision to ditch the troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.



Authorities in the United States announced a ban on Galaxy Note 7s aboard

airplanes, citing the risk of fire. Previously the Federal Aviation

Administration had urged passengers to turn off and not charge the phones aboard

planes.



Samsung said in a news release that the reduction in profits tied to that

decision was expected to be in the mid-2 trillion won range in the

October-December period and about 1 trillion won, or $900 million, for the first

quarter of next year.



Since its decision to recall millions of Note 7 devices and end production of

the model, Samsung has been readjusting profit estimates. On Wednesday, it

revised its previously estimated profit of 7.8 trillion won for the third

quarter, cutting it to 5.2 trillion won.



With the Note 7, Samsung had hoped to compete with Apple's iPhones in the

high-end smartphone market. But after some of the Note 7s were reported to heat

rapidly and catch fire, it faced one of the biggest and most costly product

recalls in the technology industry.



''Moving forward, Samsung Electronics plans to normalize its mobile business by

expanding sales of flagship models such as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge,''

the company said in a statement. ''Additionally, the company will focus on

enhancing product safety for consumers by making significant changes in its

quality assurance processes.''
