Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson puts the case for these Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge

accessories



BRILLIANCE CASE-MATE * * * * How do you ensure Samsung's curvy, flagship phone

stands out? Fit it with a case paved with genuine crystals. The Case-Mate

Brilliance is covered in faceted stones that reflect light and it features a

champagne-coloured frame and matching button covers to set them off. It's not

just good looking, though. This cover comes in two parts, including a silicon

lining to provide impact resistance in the unlikely case the crystals slip from

your grip. The blinged-up accessory does add 50g and 3mm to the size of

Samsung's slender phone, but it will be worth it for those who want to be

noticed.

EVO WALLET TECH21 * * * * This case can have your new phone completely

surrounded. The Tech21 creation not only hugs the rounded edges of the Galaxy S7

Edge with impact-reducing FlexShock material, but it then covers it with a

water-resisting material to keep scratches off its screen. Inside the flip-up

cover lies space for a credit card for use as a real wallet, while a microfibre

lining helps keep its screen pristine. The case does weigh 30g and some may not

like it covering the phone's Always On display, but the Evo Wallet provides

plenty of protection when you just want to throw your phone into a bag.

LENS COVER SAMSUNG * * * * * Of all the cases, covers, and slips for Samsung's

new smartphones, this is the smartest. The Lens Cover, out this month, takes the

phone's camera to the next level, letting users attach a high-quality, metal and

glass lens for surprisingly crisp results. It's the first time Samsung has made

a phone lens but the company's photographic experience shines through. The

wide-angle addition we tested showed little distortion at the edges yet allowed

plenty of extra detail into the frame. The case itself features a soft lining,

and understated leather-like exterior, and even though the lens screws on in

just one turn, it remains securely in place. Macro lens next, please.

AEROSHIELD CYGNETT * * * 1/2 Australian firm Cygnett attempts to solve the

Galaxy S7 Edge conundrum with this cover. Namely, how to keep its design on show

while protecting it from scratches and slips. The Aeroshield is a clear case,

available with coloured edges if you prefer, that hugs this phone's curves with

a polyurethane frame and polycarbonate shell to provide protection from drops.

It also features four raised corners on the back of the case to keep it in place

on a slippery surfaces. Its lack of weight and bulk is commendable, though this

cover does scratch quite easily.$25 / CYGNETT.COM
