They say a magician never reveals his secrets - but illusions, it seems, are

fair game.



Dynamo, aka Bradford-born 33 year-old Steven Frayne, has created a series of

brain-teasing images shot with the Samsung Galaxy S7 - and for once, he's

letting his fans know how it was done.



"Because it's just for fun, to put on my Instagram and social media, I don't

care so much if I let people in on the secret," he explains in the KPH pub at

Ladbroke Grove.



"It's a cool way to interact with my fans, and maybe inspire them to make their

own everyday illusions."

The images, from Dynamo surfing on a London double decker to stepping sideways

out of a swimming pool, are perfect fodder to inspire Instagram envy.



"Before I was doing TV, I was on YouTube and Twitter and social media. I'm from

that era," he says. "I've always been trying to find really cool ways to capture

magic in still form.



"The quality that I put out has got to be second-to-none - it's a Dynamo

picture."



The newly-announced S7, due to go on sale in the UK on March 11, boasts a 12

Megapixel camera, with new features including low-light performance, a Dual

Pixel Sensor for an extra-quick auto-focus, and motion panorama capture.

Samsung pins hopes on its S6 smartphone triumphing over Apple



Taking to the streets of London with the handset, Dynamo wants to show that

magic doesn't have to just be huge stunts or mind-boggling close-up tricks.



"You can create the best images, and people would think it's been done

professionally," he explains. "But it's just me, out on the street, with my

phone."
