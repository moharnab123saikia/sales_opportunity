Samsung starts refund process for Galaxy Note7 owners in the Middle East



LENGTH: 189  words





You can either get a full refund on your Note7 or exchange it with a Galaxy S7

edge



Samsung has begun the refund process for Samsung Galaxy Note7 across the Middle

East. Owners of the Note7 can either exchange their device with a Galaxy S7 edge

or receive a full refund. If you want to change the Note7 with a Galaxy S7,

Samsung will issue you a refund of AED 650 through cash or gift vouchers from

many of the Samsung branded stores across UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman.



If you prefer to get a full refund, you will need the original receipt and take

the phone back to where you originally purchased it from. If you don't have a

receipt, you will need to call Samsung at one of the following numbers:



UAE: 800-Samsung (800-7267864)



Qatar: 800-2255



Kuwait: 183-2255



Bahrain: 8000-4726



Oman: 800-Samsung (800-7267864)



Our recommendation is to get a full refund on your Note7. Samsung is charging

you the retail price for the S7 edge, however prices are much lower if you

purchase the phone online. For example, souq.com is selling the Galaxy S7 edge

Duos version for AED 1899 which is lower than what Samsung is selling it to you

for.
