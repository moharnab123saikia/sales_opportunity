Samsung Galaxy S7 is going to be the name of the company's next flagship

smartphone and it is expected that the device will be available to purchase in

both the Snapdragon 820 and Exynos M1 variants. Since Snapdragon 820 is going to

come out much sooner than Samsung's own mobile chipset, the company is busy

performing rigorous tests on it. In the end, it might actually end up

incorporating a Snapdragon 820 in Galaxy S7 because the latest benchmarking leak

shows that the scores obtained by the smartphone are phenomenal.



A source reported that a when the Snapdragon 820 present inside Galaxy S7 was

taken for a test run, it was able to score impressively. According to the

specifications, Galaxy S7 is going to be feature the following hardware:



Consumers will definitely be hoping that Samsung does not follow the same

features' approach that it did with Galaxy Note 5, otherwise we could be seeing

Galaxy S7 without a removable battery, and without an external card slot;

something that will obviously spell disaster for the company. Samsung's premium

lineup of devices do not come cheap, which makes incorporating the mentioned

features even more mandatory.



We were also expecting that Galaxy S7 would feature a better camera sensor in

terms of megapixels but the specification details also reveal that the upcoming

high-end smartphone is going to have a 16MP rear sensor, followed by a 5MP front

one. Let us hope that Sony's new camera sensor is present on Galaxy S7 otherwise

those seeking to upgrade their devices just to experience a better smartphone

camera will be devastated.



As for the benchmarking scores, they have been given below. We can expect Galaxy

S7 to arrive during the second quarter of 2016.
