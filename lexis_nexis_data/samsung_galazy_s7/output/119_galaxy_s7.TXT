Samsung Galaxy S7 is going to be the name of the company's next flagship
smartphone and it is expected that the device will be available to purchase in
both the Snapdragon 820 and Exynos M1 variants. Since Snapdragon 820 is going to
come out much sooner than Samsung's own mobile chipset, the company is busy
performing rigorous tests on it. In the end, it might actually end up
incorporating a Snapdragon 820 in Galaxy S7 because the latest benchmarking leak
shows that the scores obtained by the smartphone are phenomenal.

A source reported that a when the Snapdragon 820 present inside Galaxy S7 was
taken for a test run, it was able to score impressively. According to the
specifications, Galaxy S7 is going to be feature the following hardware:

Consumers will definitely be hoping that Samsung does not follow the same
features' approach that it did with Galaxy Note 5, otherwise we could be seeing
Galaxy S7 without a removable battery, and without an external card slot;
something that will obviously spell disaster for the company. Samsung's premium
lineup of devices do not come cheap, which makes incorporating the mentioned
features even more mandatory.

We were also expecting that Galaxy S7 would feature a better camera sensor in
terms of megapixels but the specification details also reveal that the upcoming
high-end smartphone is going to have a 16MP rear sensor, followed by a 5MP front
one. Let us hope that Sony's new camera sensor is present on Galaxy S7 otherwise
those seeking to upgrade their devices just to experience a better smartphone
camera will be devastated.

As for the benchmarking scores, they have been given below. We can expect Galaxy
S7 to arrive during the second quarter of 2016.
