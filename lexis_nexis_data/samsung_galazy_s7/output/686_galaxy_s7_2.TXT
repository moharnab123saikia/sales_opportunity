Owners of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 in South Korea are being offered a new

compensation package.



In a move to appease Galaxy Note 7 owners who had to exchange their faulty

devices for a Galaxy S7 after reports of battery fires and exploding phones, the

South Korean electronics and mobile giant announced an upgrade program that will

make them eligible for a Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8 when they're launched next

year.



Customers will be able to upgrade to the forthcoming models at half the price of

the Galaxy S7.



This is Samsung's latest attempt to quell angry consumers. The company has also

offered 100,000 KRW (US$88) in compensation to Note 7 owners in the country.



There is no word on whether or not the upgrade program will be offered outside

South Korea.
