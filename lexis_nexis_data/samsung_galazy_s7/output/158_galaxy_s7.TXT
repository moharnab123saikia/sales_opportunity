is over as it's finally landed in stores today.

The new Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have plenty of new features including a new
water-resistant design, an SD card slot for expandable memory, and a big enough
battery to watch 12 hours of HD video in a single charge.

But if you want to get your hands on one and buy it outright, you'll be paying
£569 for a SIM-free S7, and the S7 Edge starts from £639 for a SIM-free
smartphone.

If you're going to take up a tariff and pay monthly though, you can spread out
the costs.

Here are the tariffs on offer at the leading UK networks.
