A new flagship handset and an even greater focus on virtual reality are expected

to top the bill when Samsung's latest Unpacked event takes place on February 21.



Invitations to the company's annual pre-MWC press event and the accompanying

teaser video make it clear that the next Galaxy handset will make its debut and

that with its unveiling we should "Get ready to rethink what a phone can do."



The video also suggests that this re-thinking should be done around the subject

of virtual reality. Despite a reputation as a "fast follower," Samsung has been

very quick and very pioneering when it comes to VR. Its own headset, the Gear VR

is both good-quality and affordable, if limited, while its components and

display technologies are also essential to the very premium Oculus Rift.



For many in the tech industry, 2016 is going to be the year of Virtual Reality.

As well as Samsung, HTC, Microsoft, Sony and LG are investing heavily in the

technology, and reports that surfaced over the weekend suggest that Apple too

has a dedicated VR team exploring the possibilities.



However, like with the phablet, Samsung has a head start and the Samsung Galaxy

S7 could be the handset that sets the company further apart from its competitors

while simultaneously bridging the gap between full-on VR systems and headsets

like the Gear VR or even Google's Cardboard, by being able to track positional

data, such as how a headset wearer's hands move. That could be huge, but, for

the moment at least, may be something only those already keen on VR would

embrace with excitement.



As for the rest of us, the Galaxy S7 and the curved screen S7 Edge models are

expected to keep the same excellent form factor but see the return of two

features that have been missing from recent handsets -- water resistance and

expansion via microSD slot.



Most of the updates are expected to be under the hood, with faster processors

and, if the reports are true, a better, longer-lasting, faster-charging battery.

In other words, the things that consumers really want from a handset.
