The fight between Samsung Electronics and Apple in India is set to intensify ,

with the Korean company planning to spend a record sum on marketing and

promotion for the new flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge that will be unveiled next

week and its US rival drawing up a counter-strategy .



Samsung may invest about ' . 100 crore on marketing its latest smartphones,

which will be launched in India around March 8 and go on sale from the third

week of March at prices that could match Apple's iPhone 6s models. It has asked

dealers to ensure maximum mileage for the Samsung brand on shop floors, three

senior industry executives said.



To take on Samsung, Apple has told dealers that it will have additional consumer

promotion and is considering reducing prices on some models. The company has

lined up a counter-marketing budget of ' . 30-40 crore, the executives said.



"This is the first time Apple is reacting to a flagship



launch from Samsung in India, signifying how important the Indian market is

emerging for both the smartphone giants," said one executive. "While Samsung is

tightening the trade, Apple has told us to



expect something big."



Samsung India has issued an advisory linking payments to dealers to he

visibility of its branding on store ronts and inside.



It asked retailers to ensure its brand billboard is the first one above the hop

entrance and only its brands be displayed on store walls.



Industry executives said Samsung may offer the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge at



. 50,000-plus launch price for a cheaper rate than the ' last year's flagship

Galaxy S6.



. 45,000 to The company is looking at a price of about ' compete with the iPhone

6s that's currently selling at '44,000-45,000.



The Korean company has advised dealers that any discounting will entail strict

disciplinary action, including blacklisting, since it does not want a price war

on the new models, industry executives said. Apple distributors have started

taking feedback from key trade partners in India on the level of support that

might be required to counter Samsung's new launches.



"Samsung's recent launches such as Galaxy A5 and A7 had gained a lot of share,

which has already irked Apple. Apple has informed traders that it will offer

additional consumer and trade promotion on its entire line-up and may also cut

prices," a senior trade partner of the company said. Emails sent to Samsung

India and Apple seeking comment did not elicit any response till Thursday press

time.



Both companies are fighting to dominate the premium smartphone segment in India,

where handsets are priced over '. 30,000. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are crucial

for Samsung, which wants to be the clear leader in this segment.



Apple, too, does not want to lose ground after chief executive Tim Cook recently

talked about investing more in India to gain lead. Recent market share reports

have failed to identify a clear leader in the premium smartphone segment in

India.
