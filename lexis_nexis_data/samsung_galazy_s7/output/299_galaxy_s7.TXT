The Samsung Galaxy S7 has been the center of many rumors these days. Just

recently we heard about the chipset, but until now there was no news in

particular about its pricing. The latest flagship from Samsung may actually be

10 percent lower than the launch price of its predecessor the Galaxy S6.



According to a report by the Times of India, China based analyst Pan Jiutang

states that Samsung will be playing with the pricing for its next flagship. The

Galaxy S7 is expected to be announced in a few months for the coming year, and

it is expected to be 10 percent lower than the Galaxy S6. This could be the

boost Samsung needs to give it a head start from its competitors such as HTC and

Sony.



The Samsung Galaxy S6 sales did not hit the initial targets for it when it was

released this year in April. Although the phone packed an amazing set of

features, its pricing was an issue. This lead to the Note5 having better sales

as well.



The Samsung Galaxy S7 recently popped up on benchmarking website AnTuTu, showing

off high scores of 103,692 points, which in comparison the closest that this

years flagships have come to were around 80,000 points (Huawei HiSilicon Kirin

950). The announcements for the Samsung Galaxy S7 is expected to be out early

next year.
