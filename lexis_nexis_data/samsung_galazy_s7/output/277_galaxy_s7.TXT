being expanded to other devices as well.

Samsung launched its very own cloud service on August 2, side by side with the
launch of the Galaxy Note 7. Now, the company is making the service available to
Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge users as well.

According to SamMobile, a new software update has begun rolling out for S7 and
S7 Edge users in Italy. Aside from the cloud storage, it adds performance
boosting tweaks for NFC and Bluetooth connectivity, as well as a security patch.

The Samsung Cloud was initially launched as an offshoot of its "Smart Switch
feature, that let users backup and then transfer their data to a new device when
switching smartphones. Now, the cloud service offers users 15GB of free storage,
and is expected to allow a complete phone backup option.

According to the report, Samsung is also expected to bring the cloud service to
the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+ and the Galaxy Note 5 in the near future
