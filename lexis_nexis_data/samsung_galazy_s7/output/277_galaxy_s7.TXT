Reports indicate the 15GB of free cloud storage available to Note 7 users is

being expanded to other devices as well.



Samsung launched its very own cloud service on August 2, side by side with the

launch of the Galaxy Note 7. Now, the company is making the service available to

Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge users as well.



According to SamMobile, a new software update has begun rolling out for S7 and

S7 Edge users in Italy. Aside from the cloud storage, it adds performance

boosting tweaks for NFC and Bluetooth connectivity, as well as a security patch.



The Samsung Cloud was initially launched as an offshoot of its "Smart Switch

feature, that let users backup and then transfer their data to a new device when

switching smartphones. Now, the cloud service offers users 15GB of free storage,

and is expected to allow a complete phone backup option.



According to the report, Samsung is also expected to bring the cloud service to

the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+ and the Galaxy Note 5 in the near future
