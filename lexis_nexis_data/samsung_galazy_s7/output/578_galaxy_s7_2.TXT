Motorola Droid



Turbo 2



CNET rating: 4 stars out of 5 (Excellent)



The good: The Motorola Droid Turbo 2 has a tough screen that won't crack. Plus,

it has top-tier performance, solid battery life and the ability to design your

own phone at Motorola's website.



The bad: The Turbo 2's camera lags behind the best you can buy, and the

shatterproof screen comes with some trade-offs. In the U.S., it's exclusive to

Verizon.



The cost: $487.90 to $649.99



The bottom line: The Verizon-exclusive Droid Turbo 2 delivers on its promise of

an uncrackable screen - and it's a great all-around Android phone, too.



Samsung Galaxy



S7 Active



CNET rating: 4 stars out of 5 (Excellent)



The good: The Galaxy S7 Active has extra long battery life and is resistant to

dust, water and drops. It has the same speedy performance, expandable storage

and excellent camera quality as the original S7.



The bad: The bulky, plastic design feels cheap compared with the glass-and-metal

S7, and the phone is expensive.



The cost: $794.99 to $829.99



The bottom line: AT&T customers looking for a durable and high-end smartphone

can't go wrong with the Galaxy S7 Active.



Cat S60



CNET rating: 3.5 stars out of 5 (Very good)



The good: The Cat S60 features a built-in thermal imaging camera. It can

consistently survive 6-foot drops onto concrete and can take a 16-foot dunking

into water. It has an expandable microSD card slot and loud front-facing

speakers.



The bad: It's significantly thicker and heavier than other smartphones. The

thermal imaging feature while cool and fun, is mostly useless aside from some

specific cases.



The cost: $669.26



The bottom line: The Cat S60's durable build is impressive, but its appeal is

limited to those who can make good use of its built-in thermal imaging camera.



Sony Xperia Z5



CNET rating: 3.5 stars out of 5 (Very good)



The good: The Sony Xperia Z5 looks good, has plenty of power, its camera can

take some great snaps, and it won't die when you spill your drink on it.



The bad: Only minor updates from its predecessor means it lacks the excitement

of its rivals. Its waterproofing no longer allows for full submersion, meaning

it can't be used for underwater photography.



The cost: $399.99 (refurbished) to $450.00



The bottom line: Even with strong specs befitting a high-end phone, the Sony

Xperia Z5 adds little over its predecessor to make it an exciting option over

rivals like the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.
