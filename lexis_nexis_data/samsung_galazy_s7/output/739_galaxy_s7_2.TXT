In a blog post released on Wednesday, Oculus VR has disclosed that the Samsung

Gear VR headset -- which is powered by Oculus VR technology -- was used by more

than one million virtual-reality aficionados in April.



The figures revealed by Oculus about Gear VR users in April is quite impressive

given the fact that the consumer version of Gear VR was released by Samsung

barely six months back; and it works with only a few Samsung handsets including

the Galaxy S7, the Galaxy S7 Edge, the Galaxy Note 5, the Galaxy S6, and the

Galaxy S6 Edge.



The disclosure by Oculus VR that the number of monthly users of Samsung Gear VR

in April surpassed one million is an evident indication of the fact that the

mobile VR arena is witnessing a notable progress.



Oculus has also said in the blog post that ever since the consumer Gear VR

version hit the markets six months back, more than 250 apps for the device have

already been generated by developers. Some of the best-selling apps for Gear VR

include EVE Gunjack, Star Chart, End Space, Minecraft, Escape Room VR, Deer

Hunter VR, Land's End, Ocean Rift, Dreadhalls, and Bandit Six.



Further adding that some of the 'must-haves' for Gear VR headset include Hulu,

Goosebumps Night of Scares, Milk VR, and Orion Trail VR, Oculus said: "VR video

continues to be one of the most popular experiences on Gear VR."
