Gear VR headset -- which is powered by Oculus VR technology -- was used by more
than one million virtual-reality aficionados in April.

The figures revealed by Oculus about Gear VR users in April is quite impressive
given the fact that the consumer version of Gear VR was released by Samsung
barely six months back; and it works with only a few Samsung handsets including
the Galaxy S7, the Galaxy S7 Edge, the Galaxy Note 5, the Galaxy S6, and the
Galaxy S6 Edge.

The disclosure by Oculus VR that the number of monthly users of Samsung Gear VR
in April surpassed one million is an evident indication of the fact that the
mobile VR arena is witnessing a notable progress.

Oculus has also said in the blog post that ever since the consumer Gear VR
version hit the markets six months back, more than 250 apps for the device have
already been generated by developers. Some of the best-selling apps for Gear VR
include EVE Gunjack, Star Chart, End Space, Minecraft, Escape Room VR, Deer
Hunter VR, Land's End, Ocean Rift, Dreadhalls, and Bandit Six.

Further adding that some of the 'must-haves' for Gear VR headset include Hulu,
Goosebumps Night of Scares, Milk VR, and Orion Trail VR, Oculus said: "VR video
continues to be one of the most popular experiences on Gear VR."
