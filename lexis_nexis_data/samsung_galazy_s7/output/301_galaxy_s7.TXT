In terms of water-resistance, the Galaxy S7 edge has an "edge" over the iPhone.



Waterproof phones have been around for over a decade. Especially, the Japanese

have affinity towards such handsets. In the land of rising Sun, brands such as

Sharp, Fujitsu, Kyocera have been churning out handsets that can withstand

water. For the rest of the world though, the first water-resistant mainstream

Android was the Motorola Defy. However, Motorola's vision for waterproof phones

was quite repulsive to look at. Soon, Sony showed the world that a waterproof

phone need not be an eyesore. Finally, it was Samsung that took the engineering

to the extremes to deliver a sleek yet waterproof Galaxy S7 edge. With the

iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple followed the suite. The Cupertino-based

company did a brilliant job at adding the element protection without

compromising on the aesthetics.



However, unlike Samsung, Apple isn't confident about its waterproof phone. In

fact, the American company refuses to cover liquid damage for its waterproof

iPhone under warranty. Here's the screenshot of iPhone 7's official product

page.



If you buy the new iPhone this Diwali, do not challenge your Galaxy S7 edge

wielding friend at a pool party. Now, lets move onto the explanation part. While

in general both the iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge are waterproof. The

Galaxy S7 edge is rated IP68 whereas the iPhone 7 settles for IP67. IP stands

for Ingress Protection. The first digit represents the protection against dust.

Both the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge are rated 6, which means these handsets are

full protected against dust. The second digit represents water resistance. The

iPhone's is rated 7, which means that it is protected protected against the

effects of temporary submersion in water for 30 minutes at 3 feet. On the other

hand, Samsung's phone is rated 8, which offers protection against the effects of

permanent submersion in water up to 13 feet. Clearly, Samsung's flagship is

better equipped to survive under-water. Little wonder then, Apple is being

cautious about the warranty part. It is not the first one to do so either as

Sony has a similar policy on fully submerged phones.
