Nepal, Oct. 24 -- Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Monday it is offering an

upgrade programme to Galaxy Note 7 customers in South Korea who trade in their

recalled device for a Galaxy S7 phone.



In a statement, Samsung said customers who trade in their Note 7 phone for

either a flat-screen or curved-screen version of the Galaxy S7 can trade up for

a Galaxy S8 or Note 8 smartphone launching next year through an upgrade

programme.



Users in the upgrade programme will have to pay half of the price of a Galaxy S7

device before exchanging to the S8 or the Note 8, Samsung said.
