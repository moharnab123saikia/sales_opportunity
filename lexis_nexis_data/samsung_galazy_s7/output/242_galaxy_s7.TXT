Samsung Galaxy S7 owners are getting reminded their phone is not being recalled



LENGTH: 176  words





Its the Note7 being recalled, not the S7.



Samsung S7 owners is reportedly getting a direct notification on their phones

reminding them that their devices are not under the same worldwide recall

program as the Note 7.



The message is clearly meant to inform Galaxy S7 owners and also perhaps to

reassure them their phone will not explode. Samsung seems to think that some

Galaxy S7 owners have started to confuse their phone for the Note7 because they

both have a 7 in their name, even the S7 came out months before the Note 7.



For sure, Samsung does not want Galaxy S7 owners to return or exchange their

phones for something else out of confusion. Due to recent events, the company

has already cut back its profit forecast for the third quarter of 2016 from 7.8

trillion won (about $7.0 billion) down to 5.2 trillion won ($4.6 billion) due to

the Note 7 recall. Some financial analysts are predicting the revenue loss for

Samsung could be as high as $17 billion. Those predictions could get even worse

if S7 owners think their phones could blow up as well.
