 Berkshire: Telef&oacute;nica UK Limited has issued the following news release:

 Furthermore, customers who pre-order either device before Monday 7 March will

have their order sent to them on Tuesday 8 March, three days before the phone

goes on general sale on Friday 11 March. Meanwhile any customer who purchases

either phone before Wednes-day 27 April will also receive a free pair of Jabra

Sport Pulse headphones.







 500MB to 30GB tariffs







 The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge come in Black Onyx and Gold Platinum and are the

latest members of Samsung's range of Galaxy S smartphones. With water

resistance, fast charging and expandable storage, it's got all the features

customers know and love. Plus the S7 and S7 edge's camera technology means

perfect photos every time, even in low light.







 Both phones are available on a range of O2 Refresh tariffs, offering customers

between 500MB and 30GB data, and up to unlimited minutes and texts.







 Tariffs on offer for the Galaxy S7 include unlimited minutes, texts and 3GB

data for &pound;46 per month with an upfront cost of &pound;29.99. Those opting

for the Galaxy S7 edge can choose from options such as paying &pound;51 per

month for unlimited minutes, texts and 3GB data with an upfront cost of

&pound;9.99.







 Extra flexibility, only with O2



 "We know that there's nothing better than always having the latest phone, which

is why we've created a tariff to always keep Samsung fans ahead of the curve"



 Nina Bibby, O2's Marketing and Consumer Director







 Customers who choose O2's 30GB tariff will also have extra flexibility when it

comes to up-grading their S7 or S7 edge.







 While O2's current Refresh tariff gives customers complete control over their

monthly spend and the ability to upgrade at any time by simply paying off what's

left of the cost of their phone, customers taking the new 30GB tariff will have

that payment made for them by O2 when they trade their phone in.







 Tariffs on offer with 30GB data include &pound;59 per month and a &pound;9.99

upfront cost for the Galaxy S7 and &pound;64 per month with a &pound;9.99

upfront cost for the Galaxy S7 edge. All tariffs with 30GB data offer unlimited

minutes and texts.











 Customers who take this option and trade in their S7 or S7 edge at an O2 store

after twelve months will have any outstanding Phone Plan payments waived and be

able to walk straight out with their new phone and new O2 Refresh tariff.







 "We know that there's nothing better than always having the latest phone, which

is why we've created a tariff to always keep Samsung fans ahead of the curve,"

said Nina Bibby, O2's Marketing and Consumer Director. "Plus, with data

allowances of up to 30GB, our customers will have complete flexibility with how

they use their new Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge and how they upgrade it too."
