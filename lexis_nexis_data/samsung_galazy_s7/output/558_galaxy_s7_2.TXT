Samsung Galaxy S7 to have Live Photos feature

The Samsung Galaxy S7 has been the center of many rumors, ranging from two

different processors to even bringing back the microSD card slot. However, the

latest rumor suggests that it might also be coming with a feature similar to

Apple's Live Photos.



The South Korean tech giant will apparently have a feature similar to Live

Photos, which will be called Vivid Photos, in the Samsung Galaxy S7. This

feature would work like the Live Photos feature, and will record 1.5 seconds of

video before and after a photo is snapped, giving the photo a lively effect.



However, Apple may not be the only one with such a feature. Initially it was HTC

Zoe that had this feature, but Apple added this to the iPhone when it became

quite popular. Now, Samsung is using the idea, and apparently has its software

engineers testing it. But, sadly it may not be available in time for the S7, so

we can expect it as a software update. Surprisingly, the Vivid Photos feature

will not record audio or sound with the photo, thus making it easy for users to

upload the photo directly to social media as a GIF.



As for the S7, the reveal date is set to be February 21st this year, prior to

the MWC 2016 event.
