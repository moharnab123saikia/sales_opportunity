Preorders for Samsung Electronics' latest flagship smartphone Galaxy S7 and its

Edge variant have exceeded the 10 million mark in China over the past week,

SamMobile, an online website specializing in Samsung news, said Thursday.



According to SamMobile China, the figure is expected to reach some 15 million on

Friday when the week-long preorder period ends.

Samsung started receiving preorders for its latest phones from March 11 through

eight retailers in China. JD.com, the nation's largest online retailer, sold

some 6.35 million phones over the past week, while orders from Suning exceeded

1.3 million.



Samsung is all-out efforts to elevate its device sales in China. Last year, the

company lost more market share as its sales ranking fell to the sixth last year.



Last year, its market share in the Chinese smartphone market was 7.7 percent,

outpaced by Chinese budget makers as well as Apple.



SamMobile said Tuesday that preorders for the latest Galaxy phones more than

doubled in the U.S. and Europe compared to those for its predecessor Galaxy S6.

The website didn't specify exact numbers.
