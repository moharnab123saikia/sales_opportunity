The Samsung Galaxy S7 Active is now available for US customers, but some tests
run at Consumer Reports suggests, it might not exactly be as waterproof as they
say it would be.

Recent tests at the Consumer Reports included emerging the Samsung Galaxy S7
Active under five feet of water for 30 minutes which resulted in damage to the
touchscreen and cameras. Similar to the standard S7 or the S7 Edge, the S7
Active has an IP68 rating, meaning it should be good for the 30 minutes in 5
feet of water routine. While the S7 and the S7 Edge passed the test, the S7
Active handsets failed.

Samsung has confirmed that any damage or defect on the S7 Active will be covered
under warranty, but it is always better that you experiment with it by yourself
before jumping into the pool or heading to the beach with it. Technicians
running the tests found that the phone did not work normally even after two days
of drying out, however, the S7 Active performed really well in other endearing
tests.

Samsung mentioned that it has received very few complaints about water damage
and they will investigate the issue.Â "There may be an off-chance that a
defective device is not as watertight as it should be," the company said in a
statement to Consumer Reports.
