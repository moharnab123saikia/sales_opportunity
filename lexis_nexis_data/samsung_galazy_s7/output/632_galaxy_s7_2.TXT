The S7 Edge will keep Samsung ahead of the pack, writes Jennifer

Dudley-Nicholson



GALAXY S7 EDGE SAMSUNG ***** $1249, samsung.com/au YOU can spill water on this

phone, drop it in the sink, rinse it under a tap, dunk it in a pool or just

watch its screen glow underwater. Rest assured we've already done that. And the

phone survived.



Samsung not only brings back water resistance in the Galaxy S7 Edge but improves

it. What's more, it does so just as owners of the last water-loving Samsung

phone emerge, Ursula Andress-style, from their two-year contracts. It isn't the

only thing to appreciate about this seriously smart update, however. Samsung has

laid out some compelling reasons why Galaxy users should reinvest and Apple

iPhone users should reconsider their allegiances.



WATER, BABY If you sully this IP68 phone with pizza fingers, you can simply

rinse it clean under a tap. It will survive in up to 1.5m of water (up from 1m

in the Galaxy S5) and you don't need to plug its ports to protect it as they are

protected by internal rubber seals. And, given it will survive being submerged

for 30 minutes, you have time to fetch gloves before retrieving it from the

toilet.



THE MORE-WITH-LESS CAMERA Controversially, the resolution of the GS7 Edge camera

has shrunk from 16 to 12 megapixels. It's genuinely surprising, then, just how

much better it is.



Side by side, it is brighter, focuses closer and faster than the Apple iPhone 6S

camera. It's better in low light, better at tracking focus and it offers a more

accurate white balance, darker blacks and better contrast than before. At the

heart of this improvement is the largest phone camera aperture available (at

f1.7), larger pixels (at 1.44 microns) and a new style of autofocus called Dual

Pixel that is more commonly seen in DSLR cameras. There is a trade-off, however.

It only captures full-resolution photos in 4:3 format and users must drop down

to 9.1 megapixels to fill the phone's entire screen.



BATTERY After a day of normal use, we still had 70 per cent battery power by

7pm. This phone is slightly thicker and heavier than the last model, but the

trade-off is a 3600mAh battery that is 38 per cent bigger than its predecessor

and 30 per cent bigger than an iPhone 6S Plus.



OTHER FEATURES Expandable memory is back in this phone and you can add a MicroSD

card up to 200GB in size, plus its curved screen edge now delivers two rows of

app shortcuts and other options such as a news feed, tasks and location-based

shortcuts. The GS7 Edge uses a faster octa-core chip and 4GB RAM to keep Android

Marshmallow rolling, and it supports LTE Category 9 that offers up to 450

megabit download speeds. It also offers an Always On Display that shows a clock

on its otherwise blank screen, as well as wireless charging, a water-cooling

system to make the most of mobile gameplay, and it can be used with upcoming

wireless payment services. It does not, however, bring back the infra-red

blasting, TV control of the GS5 and, to get the curved screen, you must invest

in 5.5-inch Edge model rather than the 5.1-inch GS7.



VERDICT From its strange love of water to its fast-focusing camera, there are

plenty of reasons to switch to Samsung's latest smartphone.Bringing back water

resistance and expandable memory should appease Samsung GS5 loyalists, while

other smartphone users could be swayed by its low light-loving, phase-detection

camera that treats darkness like an old friend. This is one of the smartest

smartphone updates and one that will give Apple plenty to ponder.
