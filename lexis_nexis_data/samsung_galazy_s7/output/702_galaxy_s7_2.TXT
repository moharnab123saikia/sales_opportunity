Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) leads Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and
Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) in the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, industry
tracker iFixit found Thursday in a teardown of Samsung's newest phablet.

Qualcomm boasts six chips inside the latest of "Samsung's line of
phones-that-don't-fit-in-your-pocket," iFixit wrote in a teardown report. The
Galaxy Note 7 touts an Apple iPhone 6S-quashing battery. But its power falls
short of the Galaxy S7 Edge.

Among Qualcomm's offerings -- a processor, an audio codec, two radio-frequency
chips and two power management chips. Fellow RF Qorvo chipmaker brings three
chips to the mix: a high-band RF fusion module, a front-end module and a
receiver.

IBD'S TAKE: Dot-com boom darling Qualcomm sports a fast-growing dividend. Check
out IBD's Dividend Leaders.

Broadcom has at least one confirmed chip, but its Wi-Fi system-on-a-chip is also
likely contained within Samsung's Wi-Fi module, iFixit found. Samsung itself
supplies two other chips for flash memory and dynamic random-access memory
(DRAM).

Integrated Device Technology supplied a wireless power receiver, an iteration of
the component it supplies for the Apple Watch.

The chipset is nearly identical to those of the S7 and S7 Edge, iFixit found.
The Note 7 scored a four out of a best-possible 10 in repairability. Many of the
components can be replaced independently, but the chassis is vulnerable to
cracking.

Noted iFixit, "Because of the curved screen, replacing the front glass without
destroying the display is probably impossible."

In afternoon trading

Integrated Device Technology stock closed up 3.25% on the stock market today,
and Qorvo rose 1.2%. Broadcom ticked up 0.5%, and Qualcomm added 1.2%. Apple
stock dipped 0.1%.
