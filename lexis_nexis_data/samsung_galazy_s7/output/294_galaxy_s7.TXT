The two new Galaxy S7 handsets from Samsung were the most-tweeted about Mobile

World Congress topics during the annual tech conference's 2016 edition.



The Mobile World Congress has increasingly become a destination for technology

manufacturers of all kinds, but at the eighth MWC in Barcelona, February 22-25,

it was the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge that won out with Twitter users,

according to trend tracking firm Hotwire.



The pair of handsets were unveiled at the 2016 MWC as expected and accrued

35,360 tweets between them.



Very close behind was LG's latest high-spec handset, the modular G5.



Dropping down into the low 20,000s was the Sony Xperia line.



Though the Xperia X was on display, the name was also applied to four concept

designs: the Agent (a voice-controlled AI assistant), Ear (a voice-controlled

earbud), Projector (a projector that turns its target surfaces into ad-hoc

touchscreen displays) and Eye (a camera).



Also causing a buzz at MWC was the Internet of Things, Virtual Reality and 5G

data connections.



Samsung also unveiled a 360 degree camera as part of its Gear range, and

Microsoft brought new Windows 10 devices.



And though Samsung's one-two combination of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge ruled

Hotwire's individual topical tweets chart, LG was the most-tweeted about brand,

ahead of Samsung's 40,873 tweets with a total of 44,482 messages.



Top 10 most-tweeted MWC 2016 topics

1. Samsung Galaxy S7/Edge - 35,360
