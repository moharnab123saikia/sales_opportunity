 SAN FRANCISCO: Today Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (NYSE: WFC) customers may use a
Samsung mobile device to use Samsung Pay to conveniently make purchases at
magnetic stripe payment terminals as well as terminals set up for contactless
payments.


 Wells Fargo customers with a Samsung device &ndash; including the Galaxy S6, S6
edge, S6 edge+, S6 active, Note5, as well as the newly announced Galaxy S7 and
S7 edge&ndash; may pay at locations where they can swipe or tap their Wells
Fargo Debit and Credit Cards. All transactions are monitored with Wells Fargo
risk and fraud detection systems, and Wells Fargo Credit Cards and Debit Cards
are covered by Zero Liability protection*, which means customers are not
responsible if they promptly report unauthorized transactions.
 Samsung Pay has the capability to process payments at the register using Near
Field Communication (NFC) terminals, in addition to Samsung's proprietary
Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) technology, which enables acceptance with
most existing magnetic stripe terminals.
 "We are thrilled today to participate in Samsung Pay, and to continue to
provide Wells Fargo customers with convenient mobile payment options," said Jim
Smith, head of Virtual Channels for Wells Fargo. "We want to satisfy our
customers' financial needs when, where and how they want, and allowing them to
pay from a mobile wallet with features like Samsung Pay helps us fulfill that
promise."
