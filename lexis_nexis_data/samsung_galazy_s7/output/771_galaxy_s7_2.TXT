differences between Galaxy Note 7 and Galaxy Note 5

(UPDATE: Due to some technical issues, we could not upload the beautiful
infograph, but you can view it here).

Galaxy Note 7 is officially here and if you're looking for the primary
differences between the newly announced smartphone and last year's flagship,
Samsung has reduced our work load and launched a beautiful infograph that looks
great and satisfies all the necessary information that we wanted to know between
the powerhouse phablets.

Looking at the specifications breakdown, Samsung pointed out during the official
announcement that the company's designers and engineers were having difficulty
in creating a curved edge screen for users that would allow them to take
advantage of the S-Pen accessory as well as give them plenty of room to play
around the display with their fingers.

With careful precision, the dual curved edge came into being on a Galaxy Note 7
and its Super AMOLED QHD display is probably going to be the best display on
smartphones for 2016. The phablet does not come with 6GB of RAM as we were all
led to believe. The smartphone comes with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. A large amount of
RAM will definitely consume more battery life so it's a good thing that Samsung
kept its hand away for making upgrades that the average consumer would probably
not take advantage of.

With 4GB RAM and an abundant number of software improvements, we are certain
that the company could leap huge distances with its Galaxy Note 7 the same way
it has with its Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. There is a 3,500mAh battery
present, which is slightly smaller than the 3,600mAh capacity present in the
edge version of Galaxy S7, but it's still bigger than the cell present in Galaxy
Note 5. There isn't a dual rear camera present, but you still get the capable
12MP camera with an f/1.7 aperture.

Like its predecessors announced earlier this year, Galaxy Note 7 too is going to
be announced in two chipset versions: Exynos 8890 and Snapdragon 820. The actual
release date of the smartphone is going to be August 19, and it is speculated
that the unlocked price tag of the smartphone will range between the $849-$949
mark. If you're in possession of a Galaxy Note 5, would you upgrade to a Galaxy
Note 7 or not?
