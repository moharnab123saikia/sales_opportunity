Galaxy Note 7 vs. Galaxy Note 5: Samsung's infograph shows us what's different

between the two



LENGTH: 593  words





Samsung has released a detailed infograph and highlighted the primary

differences between Galaxy Note 7 and Galaxy Note 5



(UPDATE: Due to some technical issues, we could not upload the beautiful

infograph, but you can view it here).



Galaxy Note 7 is officially here and if you're looking for the primary

differences between the newly announced smartphone and last year's flagship,

Samsung has reduced our work load and launched a beautiful infograph that looks

great and satisfies all the necessary information that we wanted to know between

the powerhouse phablets.



Looking at the specifications breakdown, Samsung pointed out during the official

announcement that the company's designers and engineers were having difficulty

in creating a curved edge screen for users that would allow them to take

advantage of the S-Pen accessory as well as give them plenty of room to play

around the display with their fingers.



With careful precision, the dual curved edge came into being on a Galaxy Note 7

and its Super AMOLED QHD display is probably going to be the best display on

smartphones for 2016. The phablet does not come with 6GB of RAM as we were all

led to believe. The smartphone comes with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. A large amount of

RAM will definitely consume more battery life so it's a good thing that Samsung

kept its hand away for making upgrades that the average consumer would probably

not take advantage of.



With 4GB RAM and an abundant number of software improvements, we are certain

that the company could leap huge distances with its Galaxy Note 7 the same way

it has with its Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. There is a 3,500mAh battery

present, which is slightly smaller than the 3,600mAh capacity present in the

edge version of Galaxy S7, but it's still bigger than the cell present in Galaxy

Note 5. There isn't a dual rear camera present, but you still get the capable

12MP camera with an f/1.7 aperture.

Like its predecessors announced earlier this year, Galaxy Note 7 too is going to

be announced in two chipset versions: Exynos 8890 and Snapdragon 820. The actual

release date of the smartphone is going to be August 19, and it is speculated

that the unlocked price tag of the smartphone will range between the $849-$949

mark. If you're in possession of a Galaxy Note 5, would you upgrade to a Galaxy

Note 7 or not?
