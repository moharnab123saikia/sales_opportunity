features.

The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge both accept MicroSD cards, allowing their storage to
be expanded, and can also be submerged underwater.

Their overall design, however, is similar to the Galaxy S6 line-up.

Rival LG has announced a modular Android smartphone which will offer extra
functions via add-on parts.

The huge phone show, Mobile World Congress, opens in Barcelona today.
