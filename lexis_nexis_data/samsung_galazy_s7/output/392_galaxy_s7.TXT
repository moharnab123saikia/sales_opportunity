LENGTH: 234  words





An Edge variant also tipped alongside.



Samsung is planning to unveil the next Galaxy Note earlier than usual to fend

off iPhone competition this year, just as it did last year. Now, a fresh image

leak further testifies to the rumour, and hints that the company may be holding

an event as soon as August 2 to unveil the phablet in the market.



Samsung is also thought to be skipping the Galaxy Note 6 in order to bring the

naming of its flagship phablet in line with that of its flagship smartphone

family, the S series. Since it announced the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge earlier this

year, it makes sense that it would also bring out the Note 7 in 2016.



Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is rumoured to pack 6GB RAM and might come along side an

Edge variant. The phablet(s) is/are expected to include Samsung's new 10nm

LPDDR4 6GB RAM, which was revealed month a month ago. A 4,000mAh battery is also

rumoured, which is 1000mAh more than the battery of Galaxy Note 5.



Some of the previous rumours related to the unannounced Galaxy Note flagship

hint at a 5.8-inch QHD display, quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor,

32GB of in-built storage with an option to support microSD cards, and a 12MP

rear camera with dualpixel tech.



The handset is also expected to have an iris scanner, in addition to being water

resistant. As usual these devices will be larger devices than the S7 and S7

Edge, and come with Samsung's S Pen stylus.
