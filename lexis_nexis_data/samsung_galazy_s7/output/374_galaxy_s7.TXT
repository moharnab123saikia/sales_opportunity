Samsung may play the price warrior in order to lure buyers.

According to China-based analyst Pan Jiutang, Samsung is considering pricing its
next flagship smartphone Galaxy S7 approximately 10% lower at launch than the
predecessor Galaxy S6. This would make the top Samsung smartphone of 2016 a much
cheaper device compared to handsets by the likes of Apple, HTC, Sony, LG etc.

A few months after the official launch of Galaxy S6 and S6 edge, Samsung gave an
official price cut to the two smartphones in order to "maintain momentum." The
company is facing tremendous competition at the top end from Apple, while
smartphone makers like Xiaomi and Lenovo are chipping away at its sales at the
lower end of the price bracket.

In a price-sensitive market like India, a 10% lower price tag may help Samsung
push sales of Galaxy S7 considering the new iPhone 6S (Rs 62,000) and iPhone 6S
Plus (Rs 72,000) are out of the reach of most buyers.

However, the launch of Samsung Galaxy S7 is at least 2-3 month away, so the
final pricing decision may change.
