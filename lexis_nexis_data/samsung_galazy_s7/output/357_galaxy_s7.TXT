New Delhi: Samsung on Tuesday launched its flagship Galaxy S7 smart-phone in

India at a time when rival Apple is giving steep competition in the top-end

segment. The new devices, priced at Rs 48,900 (for S7) and Rs 56,900 (S7 Edge),

are a step-up from the previous generation devices as they come with an option

of expandable memory, dual SIM slot, waterproof casing, and a special services

package for buyers. The Galaxy S7 features a 5.1-inch display and a 3,000mAh

battery, while the S7 Edge has a 5.5-inch display and a 3,600 mAh battery. Manu

Sharma, director for the company's mobile business, said Samsung expects to gain

market share in the premium segment with the launch of new devices.However,

analysts said demand in the premium segment is currently not very buoyant. "This

is not a very favourable time for premium products as buyers are not very

enthusiastic," Faisal Kawoosa from Cyber Media Research said.
