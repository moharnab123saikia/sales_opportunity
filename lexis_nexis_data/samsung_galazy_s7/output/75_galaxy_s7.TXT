high-end smartphones.



With Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, Samsung has introduced the first dual pixel camera

on a smartphone delivering brighter and sharper images even in low light. Both

smartphones are equipped with 12MP primary and 5MP secondary cameras.



The 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 Edge are made with 3D glass and

metal - all in a sleek design with durability and egronomic curves for a

comfortable grip. Edge UX, the advanced edge experience available on Galaxy S7

Edge provides convenience and increased efficiency by creating easy shortcuts to

users' most loved functions such as email, selfie mode, panaroma mode or third

party applications.



With these latest offerings, Samsung has made significant hardware and software
