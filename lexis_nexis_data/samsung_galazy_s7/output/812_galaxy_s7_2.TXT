A video recently posted to YouTube has offered the first peak at how the iris

scanner on Samsung's forthcoming Galaxy Note 7 handset will work.



The handset is scheduled to be unveiled by Samsung on August 2, at the 'Samsung

Unpacked' event.



According to the video, which was originally published on China's Weibo, the

Samsung Galaxy Note 7 iris scanner works in such a way that it gives the

smartphone a lightning-fast capability to detect the eyes of the user, and then

instantly unlock the screen.



The video shows that, as a result of the introduction of iris scanner on the

Samsung Galaxy Note 7, the smartphone's lock screen will be split into two

halves --- the top section of the lock screen will be for the iris scanner, and

the bottom section for the standard pattern/PIN unlock mechanism.



In addition, the users of the Galaxy Note 7 will also seemingly have the ability

to use a fingerprint sensor embedded in the handset's home button to unlock the

phone, similar to the unlocking mechanism on the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge handsets.



Meanwhile, with the YouTube video showing that the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 iris

scanner is so responsive that it can carry out eye detection instantaneously, it

is apparent that Samsung is coming up with a very compelling handset, especially

at a time when smartphone users have become increasingly aware about the

protection of their personal data.
