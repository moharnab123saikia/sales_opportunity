Scrapping Galaxy Note7 set to cost Samsung £4.4bn

Samsung has warned that the total cost of pulling its Galaxy Note7 smartphones

off the market will be at least £4.4 billion.



The South Korean firm said on Friday that the discontinuation of its flagship

phone would cost the company about 3.5 trillion won (£2.5 billion) during the

current and next quarter.



Samsung had already cut its third-quarter profit forecast by £1.9 billion

earlier this week, an amount that could wipe out its entire mobile business

profit.



On Tuesday, Samsung scrapped its flagship Galaxy Note7 smartphone, a day after

halting sales because of concerns over consumer safety, with faulty units

overheating and exploding due to a battery defect.



But Samsung has enough cash to absorb the shock from the phone recall. The

company said it expects to generate 5.2 trillion won (£3.7 billion) in operating

profit during the third quarter after the recall cost.



Samsung added that it will make significant changes in its quality assurance

processes to enhance product safety for consumers.



The company said it will expand sales of two other smartphones released in

spring - the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge - quashing rumours that it may try to

release updated versions of those devices.
