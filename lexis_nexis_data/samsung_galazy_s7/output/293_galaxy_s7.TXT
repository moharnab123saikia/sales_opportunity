Samsung's Galaxy S7 is hyped up to being one of the most anticipated smartphones

of 2016, and why wouldn't it? It packs the next generation hardware, and has all

sorts of tech present inside it. While there are some details missing that will

eventually be unveiled during the grand announcement, here are seven things that

we know about the smartphone so far.



Both Snapdragon 820 and Exynos 8890 models are going to be available in the near

future. While both mobile chipsets are manufactured on the 14nm FinFET LPP (low

power plus) technology, it is hard to say which SoC is going to outperform the

other in both raw processing performance as well as energy efficiency for

battery life conservation. As for the clock speeds of the processor running

inside both chipsets, their details have been listed below:



We expect that both chipsets will have their own fast charging technology, and

will most likely charge the battery at a much quicker pace. From what we know

about Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 technology, the smartphone's battery will be

charged from 0-80 percent in a matter of 35 minutes. While this is definitely

impressive, it does not mean that the battery of the smartphone will reach to a

100 percent in an even shorter period of time, indicating that the fast charging

tech has been made in order to put you at an advantage when you do not have

sufficient time on your hands to plug in the device.



Since both chipsets are manufactured on the 14nm FinFET LPP process, we can

expect better energy efficiency in terms of battery conservation, but this will

ultimately depend on your usage. As for the design, it is rumored that Galaxy S7

will retain the same design as its predecessor Galaxy S6, but let us hope that

we are wrong on this front.



Now, as stated earlier, Galaxy S7 is going to be available to purchase in two

chipset models, but the interesting thing here is that Samsung plans to go all

out as far as different models are concerned. According to the latest rumor from

BGR, the handset is going to be available in two screen sizes; 5.1 and 5.5

inches. The larger smartphone will have a 'Plus' at the end of the model name

indicating that it is a larger variant of the two. Earlier, there were leaks

suggesting that the screen size of the device is going to be 5.7 inches, but we

feel that it will clash with the company's high-end Note series that will be

unveiled later in the year so it is probably out of the question.



In order to let fans and consumers distinguish between the first and second

flagship of 2016, there has to be some difference. As for which models the

company could be expected to announce, they have been listed below:



The curved edge display will be retained from previous models and hopefully,

Samsung will be adding in a plethora of features that we will actually be able

to take advantage of rather than just being present there as a fashion statement

or a gimmick for appeal purposes. In addition, there was another leak stating

that the dual-SIM variants of the smartphone have been certified, so in total,

you are potentially looking at 16 different models (counting all the above

models, chipset and dual-SIM variants) that could be announced in the near

future.



Our advice is that you go for the dual-SIM 5.5 inched Galaxy S7 since you will

not only be able to accommodate two numbers, you will automatically have the

benefits that come with a larger device; more content on the screen and a larger

battery (if Samsung is planning to place it in). While we believe that launching

several different models is unnecessary, it is possible that some models will

remain limited to their own regions, although it would have been a better choice

for the company to discard the single-SIM model from the start and release

dual-SIM Galaxy S7 model for added convenience.



If there is one area where smartphones suffer extensively, it's in the camera

department, particularly in low-light areas. Over the years, companies like

Samsung have strived to improve the camera sensor technology present in its

devices, and the giant has done exceedingly well in this area. For Galaxy S7,

the company is intending on raising the bar, from all the camera angles.

Starting off, the rear sensor is going to be a 12.3MP one and it is not yet

confirmed if it is going to be developed by Samsung or Sony.



However, what we do know is that the aperture of the lens is going to be wider

than before; F/1.7 as opposed to the F/1.9 on devices like Galaxy Note 5 and

Galaxy A9, which is extremely impressive. This is definitely the very first

smartphone to sport a lens with such a wide aperture and it will definitely

shine in low-light environments. For those who are severely disappointed over

the megapixel count, keep in mind that all the image and video capturing magic

is done by the sensor and megapixels have very little importance in determining

the quality of the image and video being captured.



One more thing; the more megapixels you end up cramming in a sensor, the less

light will be able to enter per pixel. With a 12.3MP rear sensor, more light

will be able to enter per pixel, allowing you greater command in low-light

environments. So if you have a camera sensor like the ones present in Xperia Z5

Premium, Xperia Z5 and Xperia Z5 Compact, they might end up taking sharper

images than Galaxy S7 (if you decide to zoom in for comparison purposes), but

they will obviously loose out to the in low-light shots.



Hardware stabilization, or OIS (optical image stabilization) is definitely going

to be a part of the image sensor, and we are also hoping that a manual mode be

added to both the image and video capturing options, like LG did with its V10.

Unlike some users who do not rely on just a 'tap and shoot' function, there are

those who want to dive into the extensive settings array and tweak the living

daylights out the camera sensor in order to snap the best possible image.



Galaxy S7 has been rumored to pack in a battery capacity of 3,000mAh battery and

will support fast-charging. This is the same battery capacity present in Galaxy

Note 5 so with an improved chipset, updated OS and hopefully a refined

interface, you will be able to rake out more battery life from the device. In

fact, the latest info from the rumor mill suggests that the handset will be able

to deliver a whopping 17 hours of talk time on a full charge, which is extremely

impressive. Let us hope that the rumor stands true.



When was the last time we heard about a pressure sensitive display? That is

correct, on Apple Watch, and on Apple's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Looks like the

same display is going to make its way to Galaxy S7 as well. With its curved edge

display combined with a pressure sensitive screen, you will have more commands

available at your disposal. However, since this technology is particularly new,

we are afraid that it will be brushed off as nothing more than a gimmick.



This is only natural when new tech rolls out, and hopefully in the future, we

will see developers take complete advantage by implementing several of the

sensor's functions in their applications. We will have to wait and see what kind

of commands Samsung ends up putting in its upcoming handset. Hopefully, with

additional software updates, power users will be able to perform several

functions without having to pressing additional buttons.



With all the technology present inside Galaxy S7, we highly doubt that the

company will price it anywhere near what a price/performance smartphone should

cost. In fact, the handset could cost $100 higher than the original starting

price of Galaxy S6. What this means is that the regular version of the handset

could cost $849, while the curved edge display will cost $100 more. This is not

exactly what you would refer to as cheap, and as much is Samsung is charging for

its flagship, they'd better incorporate some major improvements as far as its

TouchWiz interface is concerned.



It was rumored earlier that Google was helping out Samsung in optimizing its

TouchWiz interface so let us hope that some good came out of all that help.

While Samsung has done extremely well in the hardware department, it's the

software region that is completely dismal.



While a removable battery is something that we can deal with, a lack of an

expandable storage slot is completely unacceptable for a premium priced

smartphone. That being said, it is expected that Galaxy S7 will be fitted with a

slot that will allow you to expand its existing storage. Samsung recently

announced its high-speed microSD cards and they will go extremely well with the

smartphone. Naturally, the internal storage packs impressive read and write

speeds, and while the latest iteration of storage cards will not equal their

speeds, they will certainly come close to it. Remember, when purchasing a

microSD card, never go for the cheapest since it obviously compromises on

quality and lifespan.



No doubt, Galaxy S7 is going to be a mobile powerhouse and the only way we will

get to know more about the device's specifications if is we wait for its

announcement date, which is February 21. Tell what you thought about our

predictions, and do tell us your own views in the comments below.
