 The thin MateBook has a 12-inch pixel display, weighs just 640 grammes without

the keyboard although it looks heavier, and has a battery life of ten hours

under standard use.

consumer devices chief, as he unveiled the new device in Barcelona on the eve of

the start of the Mobile World Congress, the top annual trade show for wireless

devices.

 The tablet fastens to its keyboard case using magnets and it features a

fingerprint reader.

 The entry-level model with 128 GB storage starts at 799 euros (USD 890) in

Europe with the top model coming in at 1,799 euros.

 Yu said last month that Huawei hoped to overtake US rival Apple and Korea's

Samsung to become the world's leading maker of smartphones in "three or four

years."
