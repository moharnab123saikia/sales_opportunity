Samsung has released Canadian details for the 10-country recall of 2.5 million

Galaxy Note 7 smartphones following reports that some of their batteries have

exploded or caught fire.



Samsung Electronics Canada says there has been no confirmed incident in this

country, but it's offering a voluntary exchange program for its Canadian

customer base.



Samsung's parent company said last week that it would set up a product exchange

after it confirmed 35 cases of Note 7s that exploded or caught fire due to

defective batteries from one supplier.



Owners of the phone in Canada can exchange their Galaxy Note 7 for a new one.

The company says another option is to exchange the phone for a Galaxy S7 or

Galaxy S7 Edge through the carrier or retailer that sold the device.



Samsung says Note 7 owners can initiate the exchange by visiting a

special-purpose website: CanadaNote7exchange.expertinquiry. com. It also has a

toll-free phone number: 1-800-517-3507.
