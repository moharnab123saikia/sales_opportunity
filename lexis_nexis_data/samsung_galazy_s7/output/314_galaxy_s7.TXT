Samsung S7 duo more than just an upgrade;

Both the S7 and S7 edge are worth buying just for the improvement in camera

capabilities

It is easy to look at Samsung's new duo of Galaxy S7 devices as corrections to

the mistakes made with last year's Galaxy S6 phones.



The South Korean tech giant brought back the water-resistance capability, as

well as the highly favoured microSD slot for storage expansion, both of which

were removed from last year's S6.



The push for the S7 edge, which has the curved display on both sides of the

phone, as the new flagship is also noteworthy. Samsung's failure to recognise

the popularity of the curved screen led to lost sales of the S6 edge, when its

supply could not match demand.



But it would also be a mistake to think of both S7 devices as merely incremental

upgrades to the S6.



Samsung has gone out of its way to improve the camera on the S7, making both S7

devices worth upgrading just for it.

Instead of merely bumping up the pixel count of the S6's 16MP image sensor,

Samsung has revamped the entire camera module, and actually gone with a

lower-resolution 12MP sensor.



What Samsung has done is to adopt a larger sensor size with bigger individual

pixels on the S7 camera, which now allows each pixel to capture more light and

details.



And instead of the fast phase detection autofocus, which some smartphone firms

have moved to, Samsung has developed what it calls Dual Pixel focusing for an

even faster and more accurate focusing speed.



With phase detection, a fraction of pixels are equipped with photodiodes for

focusing. With Dual Pixel, all the pixels are used for focusing, which increases

autofocusing speed - not just for stationary objects but also moving ones, as

well as subjects in low-light conditions.



The larger pixels are great for low-light shots, whether it's shooting in a room

where the fluorescent lights are on, or in a dimly lit restaurant which usually

yields dark, grainy shots with most phone cameras.



Both front and rear cameras have an aperture size of f1.7, which further helps

with low-light situations.



Late-night shots of an evening skyline showed well-defined details of the lights

in the background, and colours in the foreground.



The same image taken on the S6 and even on Apple's iPhone 6S, coughed up stark

differences in details and colour, as well as in the areas where there are

lighting and shadows.



My only quibble was that in certain indoor conditions, where the lights are the

small LED spotlight types, the camera is sharp enough to capture the light

trails that emanate from these small lights, disrupting the overall balance of

the shot.



The camera retains all of the features found in current Samsung phones, such as

Pro mode, Selective Focus and even the Live Broadcast features introduced in

last year's Galaxy Note 5.



While the design of the S7 is different from the S6, the rear curve of the S7 is

identical to that of the oversized Note 5, and I won't be surprised if the

designs of both those phones eventually converge.



Samsung has also followed LG, Lumia and Motorola in crafting an Always-On

display, which allows users to check the phone for the time, missed calls and

e-mail notifications, without waking up the device. While this feature is not as

robust as that on the LG V10, it serves its purpose.



SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 EDGE



Aside from the larger screen and bigger battery, another difference between the

S7 edge and S7 is the edge panel display. Users can modify the placement of a

small "handle" that appears on the edge of the screen. A swipe inwards from this

handle brings up sub menus, which Samsung terms edge menus, as a window overlay,

for quick access.



Users can list 10 frequently used apps on the Apps edge menu, and 10 commonly

used short-cut keys on the Tasks edge menu. The People edge menu assigns a

unique colour to five important contacts, such that the phone will light up in

that colour if any of the five people call.



I place the handle on the right edge of the screen, and swipe it with my right

thumb to cycle through the different edge menu short cuts. Users can also craft

their own edge menu panels for calendars, weather and news.



After heavy modifications on what was initially thought of as a gimmick, the

edge display seems to have finally found its mark, even if it still does not

offer the most ground-breaking of uses.



To entice potential S7 buyers, Samsung Singapore has also rolled out a $38

concierge service that, aside from offering cheaper repairs for cracked screens,

allows owners to save $350 in 12 months' time when they upgrade to next year's

flagship model.



Another thing: Users can expect to get an upcoming feature when the Samsung Pay

mobile payment service rolls out here later this year. The service will allow

users to store their credit card credentials on their phones, and authorise

payments with their fingerprints via the phone's fingerprint sensor.



Â· Verdict: The Samsung S7 corrects the mistakes of last year, and includesenough

new hardware and software to make it the top Android device in the market right

now.
