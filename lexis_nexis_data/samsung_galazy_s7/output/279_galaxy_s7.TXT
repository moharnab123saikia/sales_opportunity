Post-Galaxy Note 7 ban scenario, Samsung India Electronics has taken up an

immediately strategy to switch its premium-end customers' focus to two other

top-end models: S7 and S7 Edge. Facing a mammoth task of wiping out the memory

of ill-fated Note 7, the South Korea-based consumer electronics giant is banking

on the robust sales momentum of S7 and S7 Edge in India. The would-be buyers of

Galaxy Note 7, production of which has been stopped after the handset was found

to be prone to overheating and catching fire, will get a 'sales and offer' push

encircling S7 and S7 Edge now.



On the sidelines of its pan-India launch of the new version of My Galaxy app in

Kolkata, Manu Sharma, vice president (mobiles business), Samsung India

Electronics, told TOI: \x93We will be focusing on switching Note 7 (worth Rs

59,990) aspirants to become a proud buyer of S7 and S7Edge models (ranging

between Rs 37,000 to Rs 50,000). We'll project S7 and S7Edge on retail front

with good plans.\x93



In the wake of competition from Apple iPhone 7 and soon-tobe-launched Google

Pixel, it would be interesting to see how Samsung combat these two giant product

offerings with S7 and S7 Edge sales push. Elaborating on the 'come-back' plan,

Sharma said, \x93We are aware of the situation and trying to build up interest

on S7 and S7Edge.\x93



According to him, Samsung still remains the leader in the handset sales in India

with 48.6% market share in value terms in the smarphone segment.To unveil

4G-only smartphones now: Samsung India will only launch 4GVoLTE smartphones as

the market has shifted totally towards this end and make all future launches,

including entry-level smart phones, with 4G facility, a top company official
