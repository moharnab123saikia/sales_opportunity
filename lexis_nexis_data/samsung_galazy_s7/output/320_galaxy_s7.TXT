LENGTH: 181 words





A Galaxy S7 user was able to survive a shipwreck in the Philippines thanks to

the phone's waterproof features, said South Korean tech giant Samsung

Electronics Co. on Tuesday.



In a letter sent to the tech firm, the user, whose identity has been withheld,

was on boat heading to Sabang Beach in central Philippines for a scuba dive trip

with 10 others on July 30.



The ship overturned amid a storm and the people were stranded on the foundering

vessel for about an hour before being picked up by a nearby fishing boat,

according to the letter.



He was only able to contact authorities with his Galaxy S7, Samsung said, noting

that the battery had more than 50 percent power although in had been over 24

hours since the last charging.



According to the company, the S7 series has a IA68 rating, meaning that the

gears are fit enough to withstand dust, dirt and sand, and are resistant to

submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes.



The combined global sales of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge are estimated to

have reached 25 million worldwide as of the end of June. (Yonhap)
