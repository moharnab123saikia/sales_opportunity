IF you're addicted to your smartphone there's a major event ahead.



Mobile World Congress opens in Barcelona this weekend with some of the biggest

names in tech set to unveil their shiny new handsets.



StarTech will be packing our bags and heading to Spain to bring you all the news

and goss but, for now, here's everything you need to know about what's to come.



SAMSUNG



WHAT IT'S LAUNCHING: Galaxy S7 and S7 edge.



WHEN: Sunday, February 21. Samsung's Galaxy S6 and S6 edge were, without doubt,

the best smartphones of 2015. Now the Korean giant is expected to unveil two

all-new Galaxies.



They are rumoured to be faster, more powerful and feature improved cameras and

the welcome return of expandable storage.



SONY



WHAT IT'S LAUNCHING: New wearables.



WHEN: Monday, February 22. Sony has recently updated its smartphone range so

we're not expecting to see a new flagship phone. But there's a chance they may

update their budget range and it's been a while since Sony launched a new

smartwatch. We could also see a revamp of its fitness trackers with a new range

of its popular SmartBands.



HTC



WHAT IT'S LAUNCHING: HTC Vive.



WHEN: Monday, February 22.



If you're an HTC fan you might be disappointed. The Taiwanese firm isn't likely

to unveil its new M10 flagship phone until the spring but there is still plenty

of excitement as they will be showing their latest updates to the Vive VR

headset.



APPLE



WHAT IT'S LAUNCHING: N/A



WHEN: N/A Apple doesn't attend Mobile World Congress so don't expect any iPhone

news but we reckon its next big event will be unveiling a new iPhone and iPad

next month.



LG



WHAT IT'S LAUNCHING: LG G5 WHEN: Sunday, February 21.



StarTech wasn't a big fan of LG's last flagship phone.



Although the G4 had a good screen and camera, its plastic design and average

battery life were major disappointments.



Now LG looks set to return to its former smartphone glory with the launch of the

G5. There's plenty to be excited about with rumours suggesting an all-metal

design, always-on display, a new smart case and quick access to the battery. It

may also feature new camera technology.
