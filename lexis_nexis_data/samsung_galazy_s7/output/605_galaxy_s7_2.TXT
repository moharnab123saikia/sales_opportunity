New update brings Samsung Cloud and security improvements



Software updates are quite common for phones, and we have been used to getting

them every month as security patches for Android devices. Samsung's latest

update, brings some new treats to the Samsung S7 and S7 Edge.



The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are getting a large 151.89 MB update, which

will include the security updates for the month of July, performance

improvements, Bluetooth fixes and GPS upgrades. However, it will also include a

new feature, the Samsung Cloud, a feature introduced with the Note 7. This new

tool will allow users to backup, sync and restore files, making it easier to

switch devices. Users can save contacts, documents, photos, videos, app data,

settings, accounts and even more, making it a solution which many will enjoy.
