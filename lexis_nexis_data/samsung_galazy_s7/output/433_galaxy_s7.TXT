According to recent rumors, the Samsung Galaxy S7 might not be as powerful as we
thought it would be.

Previous leaks showed that the upcoming smartphone would have come with the
Exynos 8890 processor in some Asian markets, while other regions will be getting
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset. However, the latest benchmark from
GeekBench 3 suggests that the Snapdragon chipset would be less powerful of the
two.

The Snapdragon 820 is in fact the latest high power chip from Qualcomm and it
was benchmarked at 2320 and 5369 on a single and multi-core test respectively.
The Galaxy S7 with the Snapdragon 820 has been benchmarked at 2282 single core
and 4979 multi-core. This is more than the S6, which offered 4500 in multicore,
but it ran on the Exynos 7420. The benchmarks for the S7 show that it is not
exactly going above the 5000 mark.

However, these tests were probably done on a prototype device that was not fully
optimized. Hence, there is no real way of telling until the S7 is officially
out, and tests are conducted.
