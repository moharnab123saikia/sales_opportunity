Samsung has shared a video on Samsung Indonesia website with a tagline "Get

ready for #TheNextGalaxy." While Samsung has not revealed anything new about its

next Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones, the company has provided a teaser about

the features in the newer model from Galaxy line. Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge

weren't successful in grabbing the market share that Samsung had anticipated.



The video posted on Samsung Indonesia website shows Indonesian archer Dellie

Threesyadinda as she takes her Galaxy S phone during a training session. The

phone has a wireless charger, as the video indicated. The video also showcases

Threesyadinda using the phone while rain drops bounce on the screen of Samsung

smartphone. Samsung hasn't officially said anything about the features of the

new Galaxy S 7 smartphone.



At the bottom of the video, Samsung has indicated that the phone is not water

resistant and shouldn't be submerged in water. The company added that the video

is for dramatization purposes only. The video description added, "Success, not

only achieved with talent but also with hardwork and the right partner to bring

you to a higher level. #TheNextGalaxy."



Samsung is facing tough competition in the premium smartphone segment from

Apple. Apple has been successful in improving its market share in Chinese market

as well, an achievement which surprised technology market analysts. In the

budget phone segment, Samsung is facing competition from Chinese brands and many

other smartphone vendors like Motorola and Lenovo.



Samsung website announced that it will release the next Galaxy smartphone at

Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on February 21.



Rumors suggest that Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge will come with a larger 5.5

inch screen, matching the specifications of Apple's latest iPhone. It is still

not sure if Galaxy S7 will have force-touch technology. Apple already offers 3D

Touch in its latest iPhone.



Wireless charging and water resistance isn't anything that will entice buyers

towards Samsung Galaxy S7. Many other phones already offer these features and in

future, most of the phones will have them. Samsung will have to think out of the

box and still offer the smartphone with a competitive price tag. Pressure

sensitive touch will be a feature that most consumers will want to see it Galaxy

S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.



Rumors suggest that Galaxy S7 will have an improved camera with better imaging

quality in low light as well. And, Galaxy S7 could also do away with rear camera

bulging out as in S6.



Samsung is possibly offering a stronger battery at 3,600 mAh in Galaxy S7 Edge

compared to 2,600 mAh in Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.



According to a JD Power survey about smartphone owner satisfaction, "Nearly

one-third (31%) of customers select their phone based on its features, followed

by price at 22 percent; operating system at 17 percent; and style/design at 15

percent. Satisfaction is highest among customers who choose their phone based on

operating system, with 79 percent of these customers saying they 'strongly

agree' or 'somewhat agree' that they feel loyal to the smartphone brand."



A MacRumors report added, "Samsung's Galaxy S5 was IP67 water resistant, a

feature that didn't make it into the flagship Galaxy S6 but is expected to be

included in the Galaxy S7."



Samsung will also launch Galaxy Note 5 at MWC Barcelona.
