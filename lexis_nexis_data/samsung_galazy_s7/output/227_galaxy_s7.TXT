

After months of speculation, Samsung Electronics West Africa has begun
pre-registration for its long line of Galaxy devices.

The smartphones on offer are the alluring Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge available in
32GB with expandable memory slot of 200 GB.

Meanwhile, Samsung is giving out free back cover to all pre-registered customers
who make a purchase from any authorized Samsung retail store nationwide.

Additionally, the 50 pre-registered customers to make a purchase at select
stores will also get a free Samsung virtual reality device, Gear (VR).

Speaking on the new development, Emmanouil Revmatas, Director of Information
Technology and Mobile, Samsung, said that Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge
represented the new galaxy of unlimited possibilities.

"Samsung did not just redefine these devices but also re-imagined what they
could do based on the feedback from the people who use them, and what they need
most from the devices. Our customers are the inspiration for any innovation.

"These devices do not only look great but feel great as well and comfortable to
hold. They are sleeker with smoother edges and lines," added Revmatas.
