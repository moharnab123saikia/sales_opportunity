users after the technology giant's Gear VR headset went on sale at Telstra
stores around Cairns yesterday.

The headset allows users to enter 'virtual' and immersive worlds when used in
conjunction with Samsung's Galaxy S6 and S7 and Note 5 products.

To use the technology, users download apps, including games and experiences,
from a dedicated app store.

Users can even watch movies in their headset through the Netflix app. Student
Tarni Fisher, 20, tried out the Gear VR for the first time in Telstra's Cairns
Central store yesterday.

"It was heaps of fun," she said afterwards.

"The graphics and the colour were incredible." Telstra Cairns Central store
licensee Troy Stone said the Gear VR headsets were able to put users in the
front row of a concert or "send them sightseeing to far-flung cities".

"The immersive effect has to be seen to be believed." He revealed that his own
first experience using the Gear VR had involved dinosaurs.

"I've never put one of those sort of headsets on before," he said. "It's a bit
strange.

"It's almost kind of like you're right there." The arrival of the $159 virtual
reality headsets in Telstra stores Australia-wide coincided with the release of
Samsung's latest smartphone offerings, the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 edge.
Both phone models are dust and water resistant."This has been the highest demand
Galaxy launch that we've ever had before," Mr Stone said.
