Athletes in Rio will compete to be the fastest sprinter and highest jumper at

the Olympics next month. But there's another test underway as well: How well can

virtual reality capture sporting events?



NBC says it will provide 85 hours of virtual reality programming during the Rio

Olympics in August - though only to users of Samsung Galaxy smartphones and the

Samsung Gear VR headset. It's the first time Olympics programming will be

available in VR.



Virtual reality coverage of sports, essentially 360 video, has been growing

since VR headsets such as the Samsung Gear and Oculus Rift became widely

available earlier this year.



But right now, the audience is limited to those that have smartphones and VR

headsets, which can be pricey.



Viewers will need Samsung devices and the NBC Sports app. Samsung is the

official smartphone sponsor of the 2016 Olympics in Rio.



Compatible phones include the Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6,

Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge+ and Galaxy Note 5 phones.



The Olympics will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Argentina on Aug. 5 to 21.
