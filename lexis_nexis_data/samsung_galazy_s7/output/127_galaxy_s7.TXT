Rumors for latest benchmark scores of Samsung Galaxy S7 to be released in 2016

include the device to be available in two variants with different processors.

Samsung's Galaxy S7 will have its own Exynos 8890 chipset and the second variant

will run the Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 SoC



Samsung is all set to handle heating issues that arise in the Snapdragon 820

processor that is by adding high-tech heating pipes in the smartphones.

Overheating was a big issue for Qualcomm's previous chip, the Snapdragon 810 and

it now seems that the 820 is also facing similar issues. It has to be seen

whether the addition is for both the variants or just for the Snapdragon

version.



There are chances that the phone would be available by April 2016 and might be a

surprise launch takes places in January.



Samsung is planning to include minimal yet significant changes in the new Galaxy

S7. It is rumored that the company will continue to offer the metal and glass

design that has been earlier seen in the S6 and the S6 edge. This design has

been available in all Samsung's high-range phones including Galaxy Note 5 and

has also been provided in the new Galaxy A series for 2015.



"As the S6 and S6 Edge represented progress, the S7 will have improvements both

in picture quality, performance and other some new features. But because

smartphones have already been commoditized, you don't need to spend more on a

surface overhaul", affirmed experts.



It is being rumored that Galaxy S7 will ditch the micro-USB and have Type-C USB

phone hence joining the list of Nexus 6P, LG Nexus 5X and OnePlus 2. As per the

reports, Samsung will get back the micro-SD slot with Galaxy S7.



Another rumor is that Samsung Galaxy S7 will be 10% cheaper than its predecessor

Galaxy S7. But Samsung has not provided details on the price of the smartphone.

One can expect a return of 4K displays and Marshmallow.
