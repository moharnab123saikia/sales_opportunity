After severing its partnership with Qualcomm by incorporating its own Exynos
7420 SoC in the Galaxy S6 duo instead of Snapdragon 810, Samsung is finally
looking to patch things up with the leading mobile chipset maker in the world.
According to Etnews, Samsung is said to be testing out a new Qualcomm chipset
that might eventually find its place in the company's Galaxy S7. Earlier, it was
reported that Galaxy S7 would be featuring Samsung's own custom core (just like
Qualcomm Snapdragon 820).

One of the reasons why we feel that Samsung is making an effort to mend its
relationship with Qualcomm is because the company's upcoming handset, Galaxy S6
Edge Plus will be featuring a Snapdragon 808, along with the company's Galaxy
A8, which is expected to be armed with a Snapdragon 615. As for Galaxy S7, it
cannot be confirmed this early which SoC is going to be assimilated to the
handset, but we have a strong feeling that it is going to be Snapdragon 820.

Since Snapdragon 820 has been processed on Samsung's own 14 nm FinFET process,
the South Korean tech giant will be feeling fairly confident that the chipset
will not be suffering from some of the overheating issues that Snapdragon 810 is
plagued with. Snapdragon 820 will be running its own custom Kyro cores, which
are expected to be running at a frequency of 3.0 GHz.

While the processor present inside the SoC has eight cores, it has not yet been
confirmed if all of these cores will possess the exact same frequency.
Currently, Galaxy S7 is still undergoing the testing phase so it looks like we
will find out next year (most likely Q1, 2016) which mobile chipset is running
inside the upcoming flagship smartphone.
