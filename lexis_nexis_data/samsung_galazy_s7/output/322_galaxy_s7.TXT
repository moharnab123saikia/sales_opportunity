Samsung testing out Snapdragon SoC for its Galaxy S7 handset?

Is Samsung patching things up with Qualcomm again?



By tbreak Staff -



After severing its partnership with Qualcomm by incorporating its own Exynos

7420 SoC in the Galaxy S6 duo instead of Snapdragon 810, Samsung is finally

looking to patch things up with the leading mobile chipset maker in the world.

According to Etnews, Samsung is said to be testing out a new Qualcomm chipset

that might eventually find its place in the company's Galaxy S7. Earlier, it was

reported that Galaxy S7 would be featuring Samsung's own custom core (just like

Qualcomm Snapdragon 820).



One of the reasons why we feel that Samsung is making an effort to mend its

relationship with Qualcomm is because the company's upcoming handset, Galaxy S6

Edge Plus will be featuring a Snapdragon 808, along with the company's Galaxy

A8, which is expected to be armed with a Snapdragon 615. As for Galaxy S7, it

cannot be confirmed this early which SoC is going to be assimilated to the

handset, but we have a strong feeling that it is going to be Snapdragon 820.



Since Snapdragon 820 has been processed on Samsung's own 14 nm FinFET process,

the South Korean tech giant will be feeling fairly confident that the chipset

will not be suffering from some of theÂ overheating issues that Snapdragon 810 is

plagued with. Snapdragon 820 will be running its own custom Kyro cores, which

are expected to be running at a frequency of 3.0 GHz.



While the processor present inside the SoC has eight cores, it has not yet been

confirmed if all of these cores will possess the exact same frequency.

Currently, Galaxy S7 is still undergoing the testing phase so it looks like we

will find out next year (most likely Q1, 2016) which mobile chipset is running

inside the upcoming flagship smartphone.
