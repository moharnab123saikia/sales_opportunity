benchmark with an average score of 140.288, as of August 2016. It comes ahead of
five other Chinese handsets, most of which are only available in Asia.

Selling for just $399, the OnePlus 3 has nothing to envy of pricier, high-end
handsets from Apple and Samsung -- the iPhone 6s and the Galaxy S7 edge -- when
it comes to performance. With a design largely inspired by the iPhone 6s, this
5.5-inch cell phone has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 16MP and 8MP Sony
cameras and 6GB of RAM. It runs OxygenOS, a mobile operating system based on
Android Marshmallow and developed by OnePlus.

The OnePlus 3 is followed in the current AnTuTu ranking by the Vivo Xplay5 Elite
and the LeEco Max2, both of which sell in Asian markets. The Vivo Xplay5 Elite
is the first Chinese smartphone to get a screen with curved edges. This
5.43-inch mobile sells for approximately $674. The LeEco Max2 is a 5.7-inch
smartphone with features including a 21MP camera with optical image
stabilization. In China, it sells for under $450. Note that both phones have 6GB
of RAM.

The first handset made outside of China to appear in the ranking is the Samsung
Galaxy S7 edge, in seventh place, followed by Apple's iPhone 6s in eighth. It
remains to be seen whether its successor, the freshly unveiled iPhone 7, will be
able to match the performances of its Chinese competitors and their
Apple-inspired creations.
