Samsung Electronics said Thursday its net profit advanced 13.55 percent on-year

in the first quarter, apparently helped by robust sales of its flagship

smartphones.



Net income came to 5.25 trillion won ($4.56 billion) in the January-March

period, compared with 4.62 trillion won from a year earlier, Samsung said in its

regulatory filing.



Sales gained 5.65 percent on-year to 49.7 trillion won in the first quarter, and

its operating profit moved up 11.65 percent to 6.67 trillion won. The finalized

results were almost in line with the earnings guidance released earlier this

month.



Samsung said the IT and mobile communications business, which covers

smartphones, posted an operating profit of 3.89 trillion won, up 42 percent from

a year earlier.



It said the performance was attributed mainly to the strong sales of the Galaxy

S7 series, which went on sale in March.



Samsung added the division's profitability also improved as it streamlined the

budget smartphone models.



Samsung has been suffering from sluggish performances of its mobile division,

especially the Chinese players that ate into some of its shares.



The company said the Galaxy S7 is gaining popularity around the globe, including

in North America and Europe, adding shipments are better than they were for its

predecessor.



The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge smartphones, first showcased at a trade fair in

Spain in February, come with improved batteries, and are water and dust

resistant. The company also brought back the micro SD card slot that had

disappeared in the Galaxy S6 series.



The company's chip business, which had emerged as the new main source of profit

for Samsung last year amid poor smartphone sales, posted an operating profit of

2.63 trillion won, down 10 percent from the 2.93 trillion won posted a year

earlier.



Shares of Samsung Electronics closed 0.31 percent higher on the main bourse on

Wednesday, when the KOSPI shed 0.21 percent. The latest report of its earnings

was issued before the opening of the stock market Thursday. (Yonhap)
