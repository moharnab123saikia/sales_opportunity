Samsung Electronics announced that they will begin mass production of the first

256GB Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 2.0 standard for their high-end mobile

products. The new chips will use two lines to transfer data at a scorching 850MB

per second and consume 50% less power.



The recently released Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge have not been fitted with the

new technology so the chips are most likely headed for the next generation of

Samsung devices.



The UFS drives are approximately twice as fast as SATA-based Solid-State Drives

(SSD) found in PCs and are capable of sequential writing of up to 260MB/s which

is approximately two to three times faster than high-performance micro SD cards.



What this all means is that it can transfer a 5GB files in about 12 seconds!



Joo Sun Choi, Executive Vice President, Memory Sales and Marketing of Samsung

Electronics said, "By providing high-density UFS memory that is nearly twice as

fast as a SATA SSD for PCs, we will contribute to a paradigm shift within the

mobile data storage market. We are determined to push the competitive edge in

premium storage line-ups - OEM NVMe SSDs, external SSDs, and UFS - by moving

aggressively to enhance performance and capacity in all three markets.
