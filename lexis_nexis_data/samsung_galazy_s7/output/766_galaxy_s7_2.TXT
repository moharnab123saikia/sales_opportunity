USERS of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 are being advised to return it to where they

bought it "at the earliest opportunity" for a full refund.



Technology giant Samsung yesterday announced that it is permanently scrapping

its Â£700 Galaxy Note 7 phone after several reports of the device - and its

replacement version - catching fire.



The announcement came after several reports and advice from the firm that owners

of the smartphone should turn their device off.



"Consumers with either an original Galaxy Note 7 or replacement Galaxy Note 7

device should power down and stop using the device," the South Korean company

said in a statement.



Samsung is no longer offering phone owners the chance to swap their Note 7 for a

replacement model. Customers are advised to return the smartphone to the place

of purchase "at the earliest opportunity" for a full refund.



Any UK customers who bought their Galaxy Note 7 from the manufacturer can also

return their devices to Samsung.



To contact Samsung  you can call the customer service team on 0330 726 1000

between 9am and 6pm, Monday through Saturday.



Samsung has previously offered customers the chance to exchange a Galaxy Note 7

with a Galaxy S7 or a Galaxy S7 Edge.
