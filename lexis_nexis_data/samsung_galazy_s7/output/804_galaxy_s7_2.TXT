Pat Pilcher tests four of the latest smartphones on the market.



--------------------



When it comes to the latest crop of smartphones, there's good news and bad news.



The good news is that the they're all brilliant. The not so good news is that

choosing one is even tougher than it was last year.



Feeling the pain of confused smartphone buyers, I got my hands on the latest

crop of phones to test them out. These included an iPhone SE, Samsung Galaxy S7

Edge, HTC 10 and Huawei's P9 Plus.



All the smartphone manufacturers are upping the ante. This means no matter which

you choose, you're almost guaranteed to get a great device.



This also makes choosing which device to buy a tricky undertaking.



Each device is scored using the scale of 1 (poor) through to 5 (excellent) for

design, display, camera and operating system.



iPhone SE ($749)



Design and build



Its sharp edges and squarish design stand out against the curvy smartphones in

this roundup. It might not be original, but the build quality is hard to fault.



Score 3/5



Display



The SE sports what Apple calls a retina display. This is marketing speak for

resolutions so high that pixels are unnoticeable at typical viewing distances.

Its 4-inch display is small and the 800:1 contrast ratio is also lower than that

of the other phones in this roundup.



Score 3/5



Camera



The iPhone SE packs the same 12MP camera as the iPhone 6s. It has received a lot

of favourable reviews. This is thanks to features such as Focus Pixels, and 4K

video at 30fps. The sensor has increased resolution, improved autofocus speed,

and better noise reduction.



Score 3/5



OS



iOS is a strong point with any iDevice. Apple is fanatical about design and

usability. Lots of subtle yet clever features are built into IOS 9.3. It's

attractive and is a delight to use.



Score 4/5



Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge ($1399)



Design and build



When it comes to design, Samsung is one of the few device makers still

innovating. Where most smartphones are rectangular slabs with screens, the S7

Edge stands out thanks to its curved screen.



Score 4/5



Display



Given Samsung's history of making screens, it is little wonder that the S7's

display is a benchmark for most other phones. Its standout feature is the curved

screen edges. Unfortunately, few apps utilise the edge screen aside from

Samsung's own apps.



Score 4/5



Camera



The S7 Edge's camera has received a lot of praise. This is due to its low-light

performance. Samsung also incorporated a "Dual Pixel Sensor" for phase detection

autofocus. This means that out-of- focus shots occur far less often.



Score 4/5



OS



If there is one weak point with the S7 Edge it is TouchWiz, Samsung's Android

skin. Although there's less bloat than with earlier Galaxy devices, some lag is

still noticeable. This is most evident when it is pushed hard with demanding

apps and/or games.



Score 4/5



HTC 10 ($999)



Design and Build



The HTC 10 feels solid. It doesn't bring much of anything new to the design

table, looking a lot like HTC's earlier A9. An all-metal body sports a curved

design, but it is a bit thicker compared to the svelte Huawei P9 Plus.



Score 3/5



Display



The 5.2-inch display is nice but it lacks the vibrancy of the S7 Edge. On its

own merits, the HTC 10 has one of the best LCD displays I've seen.



Score 4/5



Camera



As with its recent siblings, the HTC 10 packs an UltraPixel sensor. This is

marketing speak for larger pixels in the image sensor. The theory being that

these bigger pixels capture more light for stronger low-light performance.



Score 3/5



OS



HTC worked with Google to craft the interface. It's about as close to stock

Android as it is possible to get. Application duplication and bloat were almost

non-existent.



Score 4/5



Huawei P9 Plus ($1299)



Design and build



Huawei used to be synonymous with cheap smartphones. Not anymore. The P9 Plus is

the larger sibling to the P9 and sports the same high-end design as the P8 with

several subtle tweaks. These include a 7mm alloy chassis, chamfered edges and

curved gorilla glass front.



Score 4/5



Display



The display on the P9 Plus is a definite step up. It has a bigger 5.5 inch

screen and offers vibrant colours and solid contrast levels. It is excellent but

isn't quite as crisp as the S7 Edge.



Score 3/5



Camera



If there's a killer feature with the P9 Plus, it is the cameras (the P9 Plus has

dual rear shooters). A near complete lack of artefacts, accurate colour and

plenty of detail make the P9 Plus's camera the best in this roundup.



Score 5/5



OS



Huawei has overlaid Android Marshmallow with their own custom EMUI skin. The

lack of an app drawer might deter some but will appeal to IOS users making the

leap across to Android. EMUI by default has a cartoony look, but there are other

themes available.



Score 3/5



Verdict



The competition was tight. This is best summarised by the fact that there was

only a four-point spread across all the devices tested.



Samsung's S7 Edge is the winner. It might not have earned a 5 anywhere, but it

scored 4s across the board, giving it a score of 16 out of 20. An excellent

camera and design saw Huawei's P9 Plus claim the second spot, rating 15 out of

20.



HTCs 10 scooped the third place thanks to its clean Android UI and gorgeous

display, scoring 14 out of 20. Considering it's a budget iDevice going up

against flagship phones, the iPhone SE did well. It might've placed at the

bottom of the devices tested, but it is still a solid choice for iOS fans

wanting an affordable upgrade.
