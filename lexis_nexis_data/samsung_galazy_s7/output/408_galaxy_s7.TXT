New Delhi, Nov. 24 -- Zee Media Bureau

 South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung is once again turning heads over

the launch of its next series of Galaxy smartphones.





 This time it is the much talked about Galaxy S7 smartphone. Several rumours

about the phone have already started doing the rounds.

 On the launch date

 Though there are several views on the launch of the smartphone but the one

point where most media reports are agreeing is the Mobile World Congress,

scheduled in Barcelona between 22 and 25 February 2016. However, some

contradictory reports can't also be negated which states that the company might

launch the phone a tad earlier. By a tad earlier, what is meant is January.

 Processor

 South Korea's Electronic Times had said that Samsung will use Qualcomm's

Snapdragon 820 chips for the Galaxy S7 phones, which will be sold in the United

States and China. But Galaxy S7 phones sold in other markets will be powered by

Samsung's own Exynos processors.

 It may be recalled that the company used only its Exynos processors for the

flagship Galaxy S6 smartphones this year, dealing a major blow to the US

chipmaker. But Samsung said earlier this year that it could opt to use Qualcomm

chips in the future.

 As time progresses, we shall be able to give clearer picture on the

smartphone's details. Till then, let rumour mills do their job!
