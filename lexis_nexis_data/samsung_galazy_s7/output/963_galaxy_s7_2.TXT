SAMSUNG forecast a 10% rise in firstquarter profits indicating a sharp

turnaround in its fortunes and suggesting strong sales of its new Galaxy S7

smartphone.



The Korean group, which is the world's biggest smartphone maker by sales, said

operating profit for the first three months of this year would be around 6.6

trillion won (Â£4 billion), up from six trillion won in the same quarter last

year. More importantly, the group managed to reverse the decline in quarterly

profits, which slumped to 6.1 trillion won in the final few months of last year.



It is a boost for Samsung, which has been battling Apple's premium dominance and

global expansions by Chinese firms Xiaomi and Huawei, which launched its new P9

smartphone range yesterday in Battersea.



"The initial figures for the Galaxy S7 look to have been much stronger than the

Galaxy S6 mainly as a result of its lower price," Edison Investment Research

analyst Richard Windsor said.



Samsung unveiled its new phone at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in

February, along with plans for its first virtual reality camera. Samsung's Gear

VR headset is powered by software made by Facebook-owned Oculus.
