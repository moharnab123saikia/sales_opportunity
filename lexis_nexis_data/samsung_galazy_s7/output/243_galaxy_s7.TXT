The price cut makes perfect marketing sense as it will push the demand of the

flagship handset.



In what might be a surprise move, Samsung has given two of its flagship

handsets, a INR 5,000 price cut, namely the S7 and S7 edge. As reported by

Gadgets NDTV, the news of the price drop was reported by a Mumbai based

retailer, but later confirmed independently. The Samsung Galaxy S7 will now have

a dealer price tag of INR 43,400 in India, while the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge will

be available at dealers for INR 50,900. The prices quoted here, are those of the

32GB variants of the phone, which were launched at INR 48,900 for the S7 and INR

56,900 for the S7 edge, respectively.



The S7 duo was initially revealed at MWC 2016, and only a month later did the

pair make an appearance in the India market. The edition to be launched in

India, happens to the 32GB variant only. But hopefully, it receives a price cut

which could bring a new set of consumers into the fold, who have appreciated the

handset earlier. However, considering that Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phablet has

just been launched, the price cut makes perfect strategic marketing sense to

push the demand of the flagship handset up. Launched with a price tag of INR

59,900, the sale of the Note 7 shall start from September 2, and the pre-booking

orders are being taken till August 30. With a steeper price range, the flagships

are meant for consumers with deep pockets, but the for the geeks, the features

and firepower matter more and will bring in the customers accordingly.
