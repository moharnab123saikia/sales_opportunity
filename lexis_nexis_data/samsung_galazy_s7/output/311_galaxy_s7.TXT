Building on its partnership with Samsung, Saudi Telecom Company (STC) announced
that it has introduced, and added for the first time in the Kingdom, the pink
colored Samsung Galaxy S7 to the smartphone range available with a series of
packages tailored to customers' individual needs.


It's a move fully consistent with STC's promise to offer all that's new and most
innovative in the telecoms world to the Saudi market, STC's senior management

the pink Galaxy S7 further strengthens STC's strategic alliance with world
renowned Samsung, a company dedicated for the innovative design and manufacture
of smart devices. The partnership ensures the very latest technologies and

Al-Sahhaf added: "The pink Galaxy S7 will be exclusively available in STC stores
across the Kingdom for two weeks for an exclusive opportunity for the market to
be the first to own this device in Saudi Arabia and enjoy it with all the
groundbreaking STC services."
By selecting the postpaid 400 plan with an 18-month contract, STC customers will
be able to get the pink Samsung S7 completely free with unlimited on-net voice
and data.

robust camera, streamlined software functionality and unparalleled connectivity
