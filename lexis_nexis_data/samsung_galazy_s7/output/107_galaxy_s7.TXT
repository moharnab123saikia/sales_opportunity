South Korean device maker Samsung unveiled its next-generation Galaxy flagship

handsets -- Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge -- at the Mobile World Congress (MWC)

2016 in Barcelona, Spain, this past weekend.



The new Galaxy handsets are quite similar in external design to the

current-generation Galaxy S6 handsets, but boast a number of subtle

enhancements.



Just like the Galaxy S6 handsets, the new Galaxy S7 models have an attractively

sculptured aircraft-grade aluminum frame which encases the glass on both sides.

The physical dimensions of the Galaxy S7 devices are also quite similar to those

of Galaxy S6 handsets, though the new handsets are comparatively thicker in size

and 14 grams heavier in weight.



Some of the refinements which Samsung has made to the new Galaxy 7 handsets,

vis-a-vis the Galaxy S6, include a slightly downward curve of the top-side of

the display for greater convenience on the ear; a bigger non-removable battery;

a more premium feel in hand; and new processors -- Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or

Exynos 8890 -- together with an additional gigabyte of RAM.



Furthermore, in the new Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge handsets, Samsung has also

corrected some mistakes which it had made with Galaxy S6 devices. The company

has brought back the memory expansion card on the new Galaxy models; and has

also included IP68 water and dust proofing.
