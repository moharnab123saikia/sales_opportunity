Samsung profit tops estimates on S7



LENGTH: 537  words





Samsung Electronics Co reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts'

estimates, fueled by stronger sales of Galaxy S7 smartphones and aggressive cost

cuts.



Net income, excluding minority interests, was 5.83 trillion won ($5.1 billion)

in the period, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said in a filing on

Thursday.



That compared with the 5.64 trillion won average of estimates compiled by

Bloomberg. The company also announced a 1.79 trillion won share buyback, the

final stage of a plan announced last year.



Samsung has benefited from sluggish sales of iPhones as US wireless carriers

promoted the Galaxy S7 for high-end consumers, helping reduce marketing

expenses. That could change in the second half as the company faces new models

from Apple Inc.



Lower prices for semiconductors and displays have also helped sales of the

company's other consumer electronics.



"The smartphone and TV divisions led the earnings surprise for the quarter,"

said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities in Seoul.



"Samsung did well in the first half, but it's a matter of how well it could

defend itself from the overall downside risks in the second half."



Shares of Samsung fell 1.3 percent to 1,507,000 won at the close of trade. The

stock has gained 20 percent this year after three straight annual declines.



"We will be implementing very active marketing activities in the second half to

drive up actual purchases and through this, we plan to continue to maintain

overall sales of our premium handsets," Lee Kyeong-tae, vice-president of the

mobile communications business, told a conference call.



Samsung will unveil its next-generation Note device with larger displays on Aug

2 in New York, Brazil and in London, the company said. While the company is

finalizing its capital spending plans, it expects a slight increase from the

year earlier.



Revenue was 50.9 trillion won in the second quarter, slightly higher than the 50

trillion won of its July 7 preliminary earnings announcement.



Samsung's earnings came the same day that June quarter data on the global market

were released, showing the fastest growth coming from Chinese vendors. Samsung

maintained its global leadership and shipped 3.4 percent more smartphones, while

those at fourth-ranked Oppo Electronics Corp more than doubled and fifth-placed

vivo Mobile Communication Technology Co Ltd jumped 62 percent, according to data

from Counterpoint Research.



Research company Canalys said the worldwide smartphone market grew modestly in

the second quarter after a disappointing first quarter.



Global shipments reached over 330 million units, with Samsung leading the market

with shipments around 80 million units.



It said Apple shipped 40 million iPhones in the quarter, a second consecutive

annual decline in shipments. In third place, Huawei Technologies Co's shipments

increased to 31 million on the back of record shipments in China and continued

growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
