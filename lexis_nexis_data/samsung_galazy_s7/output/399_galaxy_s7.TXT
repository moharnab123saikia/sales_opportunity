

Samsung has recently launched its next Flagship product-line - the Galaxy S7,
Galaxy S7 Edge and Edge Plus.

This innovative range of smartphones is enriched with powerful camera features,
Octa Core processor, 4GB RAM and Android Marshmallow Operating System, to ensure
superior performance, on-the-go.

The Galaxy S7 introduces a technologically innovated and powerful 12.2 Mega
Pixel camera that uses 56 percent bigger pixels, with an enhanced capacity to
let in 25 percent more light. This reduces the strain on the processor, enabling
you to capture sharp and vivid pictures, with more ease and speed. The device is
also enriched with an 8 MP Front-facing camera for sharper Selfies and a Dual
Video call feature.

The Auto-Focus has also been improved substantially, as Samsung's new Dual-Pixel
Sensor Technology (BRITECELL) offers lightning-quick sharpness - bringing the
camera at par with the high-performance, premium devices, while the Optical
Image-Stabilizing technology ensures great results and clearer imaging, even
with a shaky hand.
