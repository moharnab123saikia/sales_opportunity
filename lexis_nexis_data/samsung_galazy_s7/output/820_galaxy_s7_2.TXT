LENGTH: 136 words





[THE INVESTOR] Samsung Electronics on Oct. 13 kicked off its recall of the

Galaxy Note 7 in South Korea -- whereby customers can get a refund or swap their

phones for another smartphone -- two days after it discontinued the device over

safety concerns.



Consumers must visit stores where they bought the devices to get a refund or

exchange. The recall program will be completed by the end of this year,

according to local mobile carriers.



Buyers of the Note 7 had received free gifts, including Gear Fit 2, but they do

not need to return the gifts.



Consumers can exchange their Note 7s with smartphones made by other

manufacturers.



If a customer decides to swap a Note 7 for another Samsung smartphone, such as

the Galaxy S7 or the Galaxy S7 Edge, he or she will be offered a mobile gift

card worth 30,000 won (US$26.60).
