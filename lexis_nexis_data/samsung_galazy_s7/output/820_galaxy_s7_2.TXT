

[THE INVESTOR] Samsung Electronics on Oct. 13 kicked off its recall of the
Galaxy Note 7 in South Korea -- whereby customers can get a refund or swap their
phones for another smartphone -- two days after it discontinued the device over
safety concerns.

Consumers must visit stores where they bought the devices to get a refund or
exchange. The recall program will be completed by the end of this year,
according to local mobile carriers.

Buyers of the Note 7 had received free gifts, including Gear Fit 2, but they do
not need to return the gifts.

Consumers can exchange their Note 7s with smartphones made by other
manufacturers.

If a customer decides to swap a Note 7 for another Samsung smartphone, such as
the Galaxy S7 or the Galaxy S7 Edge, he or she will be offered a mobile gift
card worth 30,000 won (US$26.60).
