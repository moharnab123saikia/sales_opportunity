Samsung's latest Galaxy Note 7 phablet is one of the first smartphones to ship

with an iris scanner that can read your eyes and let you into your phone in

seconds.



Having invented the phablet in 2011 with the original Galaxy Note, Samsung has

skipped the Note 6 to bring the Note line up to numerical par with its popular

Galaxy S7 line.



The new phone features the same high-end, premium design and build that made the

Galaxy S7 Edge popular, with a fit and finish better than any of the Korean

firm's other smartphones.



But its biggest selling feature is a new biometric option in the form of an

infrared iris scanner that takes just seconds to set up and unlock the phone

with a glance of either eye. It still has a fingerprint scanner under the home

button, which glasses-wearers will appreciate as they may have to remove their

glasses or contact lenses to make the iris scanner work.



The Note 7 also features similar specifications to the Galaxy S7 Edge, including

its IP68 rating making it waterproof to depths of 1.5m for 30 minutes, a

12-megapixel camera on the back, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, with a microSD

card slot for adding more.



The phablet has a 5.7in quad HD screen, USB-C, and the integrated S-pen stylus,

which is now waterproof and will work when the screen is wet. Samsung has also

made the screen ready for the new high dynamic range video standard which is

rolling out across high-end televisions, supported by content from Amazon's

Prime video service, among others.



Samsung has also made changes to the Note 7's Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow

software, including the ability to turn video into gifs directly from the

screen, and various other stylus-related tools, including the ability to write

on the smartphone's screen when it's asleep without having to wake it up.



The Note 7's USB-C port requires a new version of the company's Gear VR headset,

which Samsung says it has reworked to be more comfortable to wear and use. The

new Gear VR also has an accessory port on the side and revamped controls.



Samsung said that it has more than 1 million users of various incarnations of

its Gear VR headset, with 500,000 sold in the EU, which makes it one of the

best-selling VR headsets.



Samsung is locked in a battle for the top-end smartphone space with arch rival

Apple, which only recently began to sell phablets. As larger-screen smartphones

have become more and more popular - the fastest growing segment in Europe -

companies have struggled to differentiate their high-priced phablets with

multiple functions from the cheaper large-screened smartphones primarily

designed for media consumption.



The Korean firm will hope that its focus on stylus functions, premium materials

and it's Knox security platform, which using both fingerprint and iris scanners

claims to be one of the most secure and easy to use smartphones available, will

lure customers from cheaper alternatives.



The Galaxy Note 7 will be available in the UK on 2 September.
