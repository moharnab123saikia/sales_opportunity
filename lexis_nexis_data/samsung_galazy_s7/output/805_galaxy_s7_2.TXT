--------------------

When it comes to the latest crop of smartphones, there's good news and bad news.

The good news is that the they're all brilliant. The not so good news is that
choosing one is even tougher than it was last year.

Feeling the pain of confused smartphone buyers, I got my hands on the latest
crop of phones to test them out. These included an iPhone SE, Samsung Galaxy S7
Edge, HTC 10 and Huawei's P9 Plus.

All the smartphone manufacturers are upping the ante. This means no matter which
you choose, you're almost guaranteed to get a great device.

This also makes choosing which device to buy a tricky undertaking.

Each device is scored using the scale of 1 (poor) through to 5 (excellent) for
design, display, camera and operating system.

iPhone SE ($749)

Design and build

Its sharp edges and squarish design stand out against the curvy smartphones in
this roundup. It might not be original, but the build quality is hard to fault.

Score 3/5

Display

The SE sports what Apple calls a retina display. This is marketing speak for
resolutions so high that pixels are unnoticeable at typical viewing distances.
Its 4-inch display is small and the 800:1 contrast ratio is also lower than that
of the other phones in this roundup.

Score 3/5

Camera

The iPhone SE packs the same 12MP camera as the iPhone 6s. It has received a lot
of favourable reviews. This is thanks to features such as Focus Pixels, and 4K
video at 30fps. The sensor has increased resolution, improved autofocus speed,
and better noise reduction.

Score 3/5

OS

iOS is a strong point with any iDevice. Apple is fanatical about design and
usability. Lots of subtle yet clever features are built into IOS 9.3. It's
attractive and is a delight to use.

Score 4/5

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge ($1399)

Design and build

When it comes to design, Samsung is one of the few device makers still
innovating. Where most smartphones are rectangular slabs with screens, the S7
Edge stands out thanks to its curved screen.

Score 4/5

Display

Given Samsung's history of making screens, it is little wonder that the S7's
display is a benchmark for most other phones. Its standout feature is the curved
screen edges. Unfortunately, few apps utilise the edge screen aside from
Samsung's own apps.

Score 4/5

Camera

The S7 Edge's camera has received a lot of praise. This is due to its low-light
performance. Samsung also incorporated a "Dual Pixel Sensor" for phase detection
autofocus. This means that out-of- focus shots occur far less often.

Score 4/5

OS

If there is one weak point with the S7 Edge it is TouchWiz, Samsung's Android
skin. Although there's less bloat than with earlier Galaxy devices, some lag is
still noticeable. This is most evident when it is pushed hard with demanding
apps and/or games.

Score 4/5

HTC 10 ($999)

Design and Build

The HTC 10 feels solid. It doesn't bring much of anything new to the design
table, looking a lot like HTC's earlier A9. An all-metal body sports a curved
design, but it is a bit thicker compared to the svelte Huawei P9 Plus.

Score 3/5

Display

The 5.2-inch display is nice but it lacks the vibrancy of the S7 Edge. On its
own merits, the HTC 10 has one of the best LCD displays I've seen.

Score 4/5

Camera

As with its recent siblings, the HTC 10 packs an UltraPixel sensor. This is
marketing speak for larger pixels in the image sensor. The theory being that
these bigger pixels capture more light for stronger low-light performance.

Score 3/5

OS

HTC worked with Google to craft the interface. It's about as close to stock
Android as it is possible to get. Application duplication and bloat were almost
non-existent.

Score 4/5

Huawei P9 Plus ($1299)

Design and build

Huawei used to be synonymous with cheap smartphones. Not anymore. The P9 Plus is
the larger sibling to the P9 and sports the same high-end design as the P8 with
several subtle tweaks. These include a 7mm alloy chassis, chamfered edges and
curved gorilla glass front.

Score 4/5

Display

The display on the P9 Plus is a definite step up. It has a bigger 5.5 inch
screen and offers vibrant colours and solid contrast levels. It is excellent but
isn't quite as crisp as the S7 Edge.

Score 3/5

Camera

If there's a killer feature with the P9 Plus, it is the cameras (the P9 Plus has
dual rear shooters). A near complete lack of artefacts, accurate colour and
plenty of detail make the P9 Plus's camera the best in this roundup.

Score 5/5

OS

Huawei has overlaid Android Marshmallow with their own custom EMUI skin. The
lack of an app drawer might deter some but will appeal to IOS users making the
leap across to Android. EMUI by default has a cartoony look, but there are other
themes available.

Score 3/5

Verdict

The competition was tight. This is best summarised by the fact that there was
only a four-point spread across all the devices tested.

Samsung's S7 Edge is the winner. It might not have earned a 5 anywhere, but it
scored 4s across the board, giving it a score of 16 out of 20. An excellent
camera and design saw Huawei's P9 Plus claim the second spot, rating 15 out of
20.

HTCs 10 scooped the third place thanks to its clean Android UI and gorgeous
display, scoring 14 out of 20. Considering it's a budget iDevice going up
against flagship phones, the iPhone SE did well. It might've placed at the
bottom of the devices tested, but it is still a solid choice for iOS fans
wanting an affordable upgrade.
