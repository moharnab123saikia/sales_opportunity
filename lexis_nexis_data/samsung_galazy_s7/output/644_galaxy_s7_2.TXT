
DATELINE: Bangladesh


Bangladesh, Oct. 24 -- Samsung is likely to announce its next Galaxy S7
smartphone in January. It would come in two processor versions: Premium and
Sub-Premium. The Premium version would represent an important value for
enterprise buyers seeking greater processing power for support of background
functions, such as encryption, without "grinding down" performance, said Phil
Hochmuth, an analyst at Strategy Analytics. "From a business perspective, the
premium version of the phone will very likely be the device corporate IT and
telecom managers will choose for corporate-liable deployments of
Samsung/Android, or for pre-approved lists of choose-your-own device (CYOD)
programmes," Hochmuth said. Samsung's reported two-version Galaxy S7 is "an
example of Android and Samsung in particular looking to challenge Apple in the
enterprise," Hochmuth added. Samsung's Knox security protections, its
partnership with Red Hat on enterprise apps and new security protections in
Android version 6.0 (Marshmallow), like 128-bit full-disk encryption, all point
to Samsung wanting to take on Apple for enterprises, he said.
