Bangladesh, Oct. 24 -- Samsung is likely to announce its next Galaxy S7

smartphone in January. It would come in two processor versions: Premium and

Sub-Premium. The Premium version would represent an important value for

enterprise buyers seeking greater processing power for support of background

functions, such as encryption, without "grinding down" performance, said Phil

Hochmuth, an analyst at Strategy Analytics. "From a business perspective, the

premium version of the phone will very likely be the device corporate IT and

telecom managers will choose for corporate-liable deployments of

Samsung/Android, or for pre-approved lists of choose-your-own device (CYOD)

programmes," Hochmuth said. Samsung's reported two-version Galaxy S7 is "an

example of Android and Samsung in particular looking to challenge Apple in the

enterprise," Hochmuth added. Samsung's Knox security protections, its

partnership with Red Hat on enterprise apps and new security protections in

Android version 6.0 (Marshmallow), like 128-bit full-disk encryption, all point

to Samsung wanting to take on Apple for enterprises, he said.
