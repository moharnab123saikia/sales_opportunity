Edge+ handset for UK. The decision came amid backlash from the loyal Note fans.

However, it remained unclear whether the South Korean mobile maker, is pulling
out the handset from other markets as well. The move by Samsung indicates that
the UK users will only see a Note 6 in the coming months, but not its
large-screen companion with an edge display.

According to Forbes, Samsung has been facing dual problems, firstly, the furious
backlash against the S6 Edge+ by the Note 5 fans, which has enjoyed a
significant following among users globally, but was soon replaced by S6 Edge
entry into the market.

Secondly, it's possible that the sales of S6 Edge+ didn't meet the expectations
Samsung was hoping.

According to Tech Radar, Samsung's plan to pull the S7 Edge +out could just be
to differentiate the position of the smaller handset a little, maybe, making it
bigger than the S7 and smaller than the Note 6.

"Samsung isn't going to launch the S7 Edge+ in the UK," said its source. "I got
the impression that it had been a bit of a disappointment sales-wise and that
the decision to keep the Note 5 out of Europe is now considered a mistake. So
our information is that the Note 6 will launch in the UK in August and that
there will be no S7 Edge+."

However, the only thing known for certain is the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the S7
Edge will be launched at Mobile World Congress 2016 on February 21, and go on
sale soon after.
