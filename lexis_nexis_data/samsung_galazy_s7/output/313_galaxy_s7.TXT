SECTION: MOBILES



LENGTH: 247 words





NEW DELHI: As theand S7 edge, the new flagship smartphones of the South Korean

giant, go on sale in India, there is a warning you must be aware of:

region-locked sim cards.READ ALSO:On the Galaxy S7 edge review unit we have

received,has put a sticker saying 'Indian sim card only,' meaning that only the

smartphone should be used only with sim cards sold in India. A similar warning

can be seen on the units sold in Europe.What does this mean?Region-locking a

smartphone means that the device won't work if a sim card of another region is

inserted.



This is a way for Samsung to ensure that gray market sellers don't pick up S7

and S7 edge units from markets like Hong Kong and sell them in countries.Samsung

started this practice with the launch of Galaxy Note 3, which was launched in

2013.Is there a way to subvert this?Yes, all you need to do is to insert the sim

card of the right region and make calls using it for 5 minutes. This will remove

the region-locking of the handset. That's it.How does this stop gray market

sellers?If a gray market seller buys Samsung Galaxy S7 orfrom Europe and sells

it in India, the buyer would need a sim card of the market, which is highly

unlikely. The only way for gray market sellers to avoid this would be to open

the box and make calls from region-locked smartphone for 5 minutes. But buyers

would not be inclined to purchase a phone that has already been opened.This

would help Samsung curb gray market.
