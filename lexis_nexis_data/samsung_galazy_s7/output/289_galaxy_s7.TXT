On Sunday afternoon PT, Bigwig South Korean device maker Samsung has sent out

the invitations for its 'Unpacked' product launch event, revealing that the

event will be held in Barcelona, Spain, on February 21, 2016.



According to the invitations, the 'Unpacked' event will officially kick off at 7

p. m. CET on February 21 -- the inaugural day of the 2016 Mobile World Congress

(MWC) trade show in Barcelona. The event will be livestreamed on the Samsung

Mobile YouTube channel.



Though the invites sent out by Samsung for the forthcoming 'Unpacked' event

tease "the next Galaxy," they do not explicitly divulge any details about the

expected proceedings on February 21. However, it is widely speculated that the

company will unveil the next- generation versions of its flagship Galaxy

handsets - Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge - at the event.



Going by the speculations, the straight-sided Galaxy S7 handset will feature a

5.1-inch Quad HD display; while the curved Galaxy S7 Edge will boast a 5.5-inch

Quad HD display. Both the displays will be pressure-sensitive.



Some of the other expected features of the new Galaxy S7 handsets include a

Snapdragon 820 processor; 4GB of RAM; a new 12- megapixel rear camera; and up to

64GB of onboard storage capacity, with a microSD card slot for storage

expansion.
