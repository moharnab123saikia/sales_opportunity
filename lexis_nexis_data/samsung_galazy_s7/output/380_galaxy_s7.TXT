OnePlus 3 vs Galaxy S7 edge: OnePlus 3 isn't the phone we thought it would be



LENGTH: 317  words





OnePlus 3 goes head to head against Galaxy S7 edge and these results are quite

appalling, showing that the latter is not as impressive as you thought



OnePlus 3 is possibly the first Android smartphone to feature 6GB of RAM and

carries a price of $399. Now, looking at the hardware specifications, you'd

obviously believe that OnePlus finally overcame the limitations of its previous

handsets with a much more improved iteration right? Not quite, because according

to a speed test taking place between the smartphone and Galaxy S7 edge, the

latter is able to prove that it is the better phone, despite receiving numerous

complaints that the device's TouchWiz skin being battery and resource hog.



In the video given below, you will be able to see how a OnePlus 3 is unable to

open up apps faster than a Galaxy S7 edge because it is unable to retain memory

faster than its very first rival, despite featuring 2GB of RAM more than

Samsung's flagship. We would have to conclude that OnePlus developers need to

seriously improve its Oxygen OS in order to reduce the aggressive memory

management software of the OnePlus 3.



This shows the mistake that most manufacturers make; they release a great

smartphone with a flawless build quality and top-notch specifications, only to

be hammered in the software department. Now, for the average user, 6GB of RAM

would prove more than a mouthful for them, but if OnePlus 3 sports this much

memory and is unable to beat a Galaxy S7 edge in loading apps faster, then

OnePlus have a huge problem on their hands.



We expect that news must have reached OnePlus by now, and now they must be

moving with a lot of pace to release a patch that would reduce the aggressive

memory management attribute. Let us hope that such an update is released next

month or else we'll be seeing even more of these comparisons, with OnePlus 3

getting struck with a critique hammer all the time.
