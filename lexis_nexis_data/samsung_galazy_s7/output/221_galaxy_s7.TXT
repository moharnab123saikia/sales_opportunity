Post-Galaxy Note 7 ban scenario, Samsung India Electronics has taken an

immediately strategy to switch its premium-end customers' focus to two other

top-end models: S7 and S7 Edge. Facing a mammoth task to wipe out the memory of

ill-fated Note 7 fiasco, the South Korea-based consumer electronics giant is

banking on the sales momentum of S7 and S7 Edge in India. The would-be buyers of

Galaxy Note 7, production of which has been stopped after the handset was found

to be prone to overheating and catching fire, will get a 'sales and offer' push

encircling S7 and S7 Edge now.



On the sidelines of its panIndia launch of the new version of My Galaxy app in

Kolkata, Manu Sharma, vice pre



sident (mobiles business), Samsung India Electronics, told TOI: \x93We will be

focusing on switching Note 7 (worth Rs 59,990-) aspirants to become a proud

buyer of S7 and S7Edge models (ranging between Rs 37,000 to Rs 50,000). We'll do

everything possible to project S7 and S7Edge on retail front with good

plans.\x93



From being touted as the 'the greatest phone on the planet', Galaxy Note 7's has

seen



a big fall in sales taking a huge toll on the handset giant's sales of high-end

models and brand image. Elaborating on the 'come-back' strategy , Sharma said,

\x93We are totally aware of the situation. We are trying to build up more

interest on S7 and S7Edge now. These two models have seen a great momentum this

year.\x93



The Samsung retailers and experience stores, too, will put thrust on these two



models to rein in the sagging demand in the premium segment sales, added a top

Samsung official. Although, according to Sharma, Samsung still remains the

undisputed leader in the handset sales in India with a 48.7% market share in

value sales. It was around 40% in the last year.



Samsung had opened prebookings for the Galaxy Note7 in India in August-end, and

the phone was slated to go on sale from September.Currently , Samsung has been

offering replacements credits to customers in the US, South Korea, etc.



It seems customers who had pre-booked and paid full amount of Rs 59,990 for the

Note 7, will now get S7 or S7 edge along with new Gear VR, the Level U \xAD

Stereo Wireless Headset free. Full refund will be given to those who don't want

the S7S7 edge.
