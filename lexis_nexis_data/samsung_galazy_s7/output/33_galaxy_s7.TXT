KARACHI, Feb. 26 -- Samsung Electronics announced the newest additions to the

Galaxy family of products, Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. Created for

today's consumer lifestyle, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge lead the industry with

a refined design, more advanced camera, streamlined software functionality and

unparalleled connectivity to a galaxy of products, services, and experiences.



"We believe in a world that is brighter, sharper, more convenient, and more fun.

We strive to deliver on that vision with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge by

marrying elegant design with functionality and providing a seamless mobile

experience," said Samsung Electronics Mobile Communications Business President

DJ Koh. "We empower consumers with technology to help them get more out of life

and will continue to push the frontier of what's possible." Galaxy S7 and Galaxy

S7 edge introduce the first dual pixel camera on a smartphone, delivering

brighter and sharper images, even in low light. Thanks to the revolutionary dual

pixel technology, brighter lens with wider aperture, and bigger pixel, the

camera has a faster shutter speed and a more accurate autofocus even in

low-light conditions. Motion Panorama, a new camera mode, brings movement to

traditional panoramic photos, giving the user a completely immersive visual

experience. The 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 edge are constructed

with 3D glass and metal - all in a sleek design with durability and ergonomic

curves for a comfortable grip. From work to play, the device's new Always-On

Display, gives users a simplified, zero touch experience where they don't need

to worry about missing a call or important notification. Without compromising

design, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge both have increased utility with IP68 water

and dust resistance. Edge UX, the advanced edge experience available on Galaxy

S7 edge, provides convenience and increased efficiency by creating easy

shortcuts to users' most loved functions such as email, selfie mode, panorama

mode or third party applications. Whether it's the seamless connection between

Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge and the new Gear S2 Classic to monitor fitness, or

connecting with Gear VR to "travel" the world - Samsung redefines what's

possible for the mobile experience and beyond.
