THE Samsung Galaxy S7 edge boasts more improved performance, better cameras, new

features, and more. Here's what you can expect from the phone, which will be

available in Malaysia starting Mar 18.



1. HIGH QUALITY IMAGES



As it applies Dual Pixel technology, the device is able to capture high quality

images in low light environments, while a large F1.7 aperture ensures brighter,

sharper photographs. New Motion Panorama and Selfie Flash functions let users

have an entirely new phonetography experience.



2. REFINED DESIGN, SLEEK CURVES



The Galaxy S7 edge boasts more seamless connection between its glass and metal

materials, along with a slimmer rear camera. The curvy form of the devices'

glass enables a better grip. And, bringing back the microSD slot, the S7 edge is

more functional than ever.



3. WATER AND DUST RESISTANCE



For people who work, travel and play in all kinds of locations and environments,

the upgraded IP68 water and dust resistance feature should be a welcome. The

feature allows users to enjoy the sleek, curvy design without the inconvenience

of a bulky additional case.



4. MADE FOR GAMING



The optimised hardware and enhanced UX allows for smoother graphics and longer

playing time for avid gamers. With the new Game Launcher app, they now have the

ability to take control of their mobile gaming experience with numerous

customisation options.



5. STORE THOUSANDS AFTER THOUSANDS OF PHOTOS AND VIDEOS



Conveniently embedded in the Galaxy S7 edge, the hybrid SIM card tray allows

users to either insert two SIM cards, or opt for only one SIM card paired with a

microSD card for up to 200GB of additional storage.



6. SIMPLE AND SOFT UX



The phone comes with customisable lock and home screens, beautified icons and

the user-friendly Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating. The refined dual edge

screen of the Galaxy S7 edge provides practical functions and easier access to

users' frequently used content and tasks.



7. LONGER USAGE WITH BIGGER BATTERY



Compared to its predecessor the Galaxy S6 edge's 2,600mAh, the Galaxy S7 edge is

equipped with a 3,600mAh battery capacity, allowing for more hours and higher

screen brightness without draining out battery usage within a day's use. The

Galaxy S7 edge also offers fast charging technology, both wired and wirelessly.
