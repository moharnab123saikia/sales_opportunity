The Samsung Galaxy S7 has been in the rumor mill ever since the Samsung Galaxy
S6 came out, and this time, there are some fresh leaks, courtesy of a few phone
case designs.

The Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung's flagship for 2016, is all set to be one of the
best phones next year, or so Samsung hopes. A recent leak of the case for the
phone show a rectangular home button and raised rear camera sensor, similar to
the renderings seen earlier. Other than that, the design looks pretty much the
same as the Galaxy S6 range. The Samsung Galaxy S7 might also be packing an iris
scanner, a feature that is already coming up, but knowing Samsung, they will
want to be way ahead of everyone else. The new iris scanner unlock will allow
users to unlock their phone by just looking at it. Other rumored features also
include 4K display, liquid cooling and the next generation Snapdragon 820.

The rumor comes from a little known Polish Android website, which also mentions
that the price of the Galaxy S7 will be significantly higher than that of the
Galaxy S6. In terms of a release date, the Galaxy S7 might be launched before
this year's Mobile World Congress, which starts on 22 February.
