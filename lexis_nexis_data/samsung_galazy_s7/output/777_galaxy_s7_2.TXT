Samsung considers ditching flat screen for Galaxy S8

[THE INVESTOR] Samsung Electronics is considering ditching a flat-screen version

for its next flagship Galaxy 8 that is expected to come out next year with a

curved display only, industry sources said on Sept. 8.



The move comes after the Galaxy S7 Edge outpaced its flat-screen sibling in

terms of sales. Now the Korean tech giant is promoting the curvy screen as its

premium smartphone lineup's key identity.



Sources said the company has already started securing display panels in two

sizes -- 5.1 inch and 5.5 inch -- from its own display-making unit Samsung

Display, the world's sole producer of double-edged screens.

For the latest Galaxy Note 7, the company has also launched a curved-screen

version only.



The yield rate is key to the strategy.



In 2015 when the company adopted the curvy screen for the first time for the

Galaxy S6 Edge, it failed to continue the sales momentum due to supply

constraints.



"It was a heart-breaking experience," said the company's mobile chief Koh

Dong-jin in August. "We have improved product quality enough to expand curved

models."
