Samsung Pay has launched in Australia with support from American Express and

Citigroup, though it said it is expanding its "partnership ecosystem."



In the last year Samsung Pay has gone live inSouth Korea, the United

States,Chinaand most recently, Spain. Australia seemed a promising market

opportunity with its high demand for contactless payments and successful launch

in neighboring regions, Elle Kim, global vice president of Samsung Pay's mobile

communications business, said in a June 15 press release. The company has

processed more than $1 billion of transactions in South Korea alone since its

August launch.



Samsung's mobile wallet, like Apple Pay and Android Pay, enables Near Field

Communication-based contactless payments at the point of sale. However, it also

employs a magstripe signal to support payments not made on NFC terminals -

something unique to Samsung among the other mobile payments services.



"Samsung Pay adopts an open engagement model, designed to support payment and

non-payment cards from multiple providers. By doing this, Samsung can operate

seamlessly with a wide range of partners, systems and payment channels," Kim

added.



Samsung Pay is available to Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy

Note 5, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge users in Australia. Availability varies by

local operator.
