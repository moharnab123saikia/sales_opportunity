Citigroup, though it said it is expanding its "partnership ecosystem."

In the last year Samsung Pay has gone live inSouth Korea, the United
States,Chinaand most recently, Spain. Australia seemed a promising market
opportunity with its high demand for contactless payments and successful launch
in neighboring regions, Elle Kim, global vice president of Samsung Pay's mobile
communications business, said in a June 15 press release. The company has
processed more than $1 billion of transactions in South Korea alone since its
August launch.

Samsung's mobile wallet, like Apple Pay and Android Pay, enables Near Field
Communication-based contactless payments at the point of sale. However, it also
employs a magstripe signal to support payments not made on NFC terminals -
something unique to Samsung among the other mobile payments services.

"Samsung Pay adopts an open engagement model, designed to support payment and
non-payment cards from multiple providers. By doing this, Samsung can operate
seamlessly with a wide range of partners, systems and payment channels," Kim
added.

Samsung Pay is available to Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy S6 edge+, Galaxy
Note 5, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge users in Australia. Availability varies by
local operator.
