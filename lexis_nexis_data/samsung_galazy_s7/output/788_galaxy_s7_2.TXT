LENGTH: 149 words





[THE INVESTOR] Samsung Electronics is expected to adopt a curved screen for its

new Galaxy Note to replicate the sales momentum of its hot-selling Galaxy S7

Edge.



According to news reports on June 16, the Korean tech giant plans to start

rolling out the upcoming Note Phablet from July with the initial production

estimated to stand at about 2.5 million units per month.

Samsung declined to confirm the reports.



The company is scheduled to hold a Galaxy Note unpacked event on Aug. 2 in New

York. Even though it is the sixth version, the new Note is widely rumored to be

named "Galaxy Note 7" in order to align its Galaxy S families.



Largely buoyed by robust sales of Edge variants, the Galaxy S7 sold almost 10

million units in the first quarter. Analysts estimate its second-quarter sales

also could surge to 15 million units.
