light conditions and may reduce the size of the rear camera bump.

Samsung has unveiled new camera technology, which is likely to feature in its
upcoming Galaxy S7.

The new camera sensor uses an RWB filter, which should produce better results in
low light conditions. Samsung has been able to reduce the size of this filter,
which could in turn mean that the S7's camera won't protrude as much as it does
on the Galaxy S6.

Samsung showed off the new camera sensor at the Electronics' Investors Forum.
Testing at the forum was done with a 16 megapixel sensor camera, but it's
unclear if this will make it to the final product.

The smartphone manufacturer has also reportedly been testing a 20 megapixel
camera sensor.

There has been plenty of speculation that Samsung is moving up the release date
of the Galaxy S7. As a result, we could see the new handset and its new camera
sensor early in February.

Alternatively, Samsung may hold off unveiling the Galaxy S7 until MWC at the end
of the month.
