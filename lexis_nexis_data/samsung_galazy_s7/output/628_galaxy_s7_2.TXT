Samsung ups mid-range ante with A7 upgrade

The Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) is the South Korean company's bid at conquering the

mid-range phone market, which is chock-full of serious, competitively priced

contenders like the Oppo R7s and the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua.



At $698, it hovers at the higher end of the price spectrum. The R7s and the

Xperia M4 Aqua - which both use the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor as

the Galaxy A7 - cost $599 and $498 respectively.



But what that extra hundred dollars or two gets you is a handful of premium

features, like a fingerprint sensor and improved optical image stabilisation for

its camera.



The new Galaxy A7 is a definite upgrade over the 2015 model, released at the

beginning of last year.



While the phones look similar, with a 5.5-inch screen and a glass-and-metal

body, the 2016 version has a fingerprint sensor, more RAM and support for the

Samsung Pay mobile payment service.



TECH SPECSPRICE: $698



PROCESSOR: Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 octa-core 1.6GHz



DISPLAY: 5.5-inch, 1,080-by-1,920 pixels



OPERATING SYSTEM: Android OS v5.1.1



CAMERA: 13-megapixel, f/1.9, 28mm (rear) and 5-megapixel, f/1.9, 24mm (front)



MEMORY: 16GB of internal storage (expandable up to 128GB), 3GB RAM



BATTERY: 3,300 mAh



RATINGFEATURES: 3/5



DESIGN: 4/5



PERFORMANCE: 4/5



VALUE FOR MONEY: 3/5



BATTERY LIFE: 4/5



OVERALL: 4/5



It also comes with dual-SIM card slots, and battery life has been beefed up from

2,600 mAh to 3,300 mAh, which has upped the weight of the phone, from 141g to a

still-manageable 172g.



In the performance department, the Galaxy A7 holds up well with a solid

mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, a 1.6GHz octa-core processor, at its core.



It will not be winning benchmark tests any time soon, but it is more than enough

to make daily tasks buttery smooth, with no noticeable lag when running multiple

apps. Barring hardcore mobile gamers, it will be more than enough for most

users.



The 13-megapixel primary camera benefits from an optical image stabilisation

system, which compensated well for my shaky hands. The camera also handles

distortions at the edges of the frame competently, with little warping, and has

accurate colour reproduction.



It does not have the widest field of view compared to a phone like the Galaxy

S7, and I find myself having to step back more than normal to fit everything

into the frame.



The body of the phone has a premium look, with very narrow bezels and gently

bevelled edges. In some ways, it feels better in the hand than Samsung's

flagship Galaxy S7 phone, as the A7 has a bigger screen and a thinner body:

5.5-inch and 7.3mm, versus the S7's 5.1-inch and 7.9mm.



Because of the bigger screen, though, it has a pixel density of only 401 ppi,

compared to the 577 ppi of the S7.



This is not very obvious when watching videos. But when reading crisp text, it

is clear that the A7's screen is not as high-end.

GRAPHIC: The new Samsung Galaxy A7 boasts some premium features, such as a

fingerprint sensor and improved optical image stabilisation for its camera. It

also scores in the looks department. But the phone costs more than its

competitors such as the Sony Xpreria M4 Aqua.
