There are not many smartphones set to launch this year, apart from the new Pixel
and Pixel XL, but rumors of the Samsung S8 have already started to spread.

Expected to come out early next year, the Samsung S8 is set to come with a new
Exynos 8895 processor runs at up to 3GHz, which is an upgrade from the 2.3GHz in
the Exynos 8890 which powers most versions of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Note 7
(and up from a maximum 2.15GHz in the Snapdragon 820 versions of those phones
shipped to the US). There are chances that the US markets will get the
Snapdragon 830 chip, while the other markets will get the Exynos 8895.

The leak also adds that the Exynos chip will be optimized for low power usage of
no higher than 5W and that could also improve image processing performance by
over 70%, which could mean more importance to the S8's camera, which could also
be a dual lens camera. Rumor has it the chip achieved a single-core Geekbench
score of 2301 and a multi-core one of 7019 while the Exynos version of the
Galaxy S7 managed a multi-core score of 6542.

There are no ways to verify the rumors, but chances are Samsung may bring
forward the launch of the Galaxy S8, to help counter the impact of having to
recall the Galaxy Note 7.
