Samsung on Tuesday launched its flagship Galaxy S7 smartphone in India at a time

when rival Apple is giving steep competition in the top-end segment.



The new devices, priced at Rs 48,900 (for S7) and Rs 56,900 (S7 Edge), are a

step-up from the previous generation devices as they come with an option of

expandable memory , dual SIM slot, waterproof casing, and a special services

package for buyers.



The Galaxy S7 features a 5.1-inch display and a 3,000mAh battery , while the S7

Edge has a 5.5-inch display and a 3,600 mAh battery . Manu Sharma, director for

the company's mobile business, said Samsung expects to gain market share in the

premium segment with the launch of new devices.



However, analysts said demand in the premium segment is currently not very

buoyant. "This is not a very favourable time for premium products as buyers are

not very enthusiastic," Faisal Kawoosa from Cyber Media Research said.
