Samsung earlier said the devices will be available for sales on March 11 in 60

countries around the globe.



The initial factory price of the 32-gigabyte Galaxy S6 had stood at 858,000 won,

while the Galaxy S6 Edge's price tag was 979,000 won.



Samsung Electronics also started displaying the new smartphones in local stores,

allowing users to get a firsthand look at the devices.



On Sunday, Samsung Electronics showcased the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, which

came with improved batteries and are water-dust resistant.



Samsung also said it has adopted what it calls a "dual pixel sensor" for the

cameras of the two models for the first time in the industry, which will enhance

the quality of photos to the level of high-end cameras.
