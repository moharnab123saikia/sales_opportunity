Samsung has not been getting its expected success rates with the Galaxy S6 and
S6 Edge according to the recent financials released by the company. While the
design is not to be blamed here, Samsung fans have to look forward to the S7
which may define Samsung's stake in the smartphone industry.

Rumors have it that Samsung will be joining forces with Qualcomm to bring in the
latest processors for the S7. While Samsung claims to be working hard on their
own chipsets like the Exynos 7240, rumors leaked from Qualcomm state that the
new Snapdragon 820 processor will be compatible with Samsung devices.

This is a strange move as Samsung announced that with the S6 it would no longer
use Qualcomm processors. Rumors suggest that Samsung wants to work with Qualcomm
as their Exynos line up cannot handle features that Samsung has in the pipeline
for the S7. However, rumors about Samsung and Qualcomm working together have
become widespread, while the two companies are yet to make official statements.

The Qualcomm processor may be what Samsung needs to make its comeback. Some
users were disappointed when the S6 was released without expandable storage or a
removable battery as well as the increased pricing.
