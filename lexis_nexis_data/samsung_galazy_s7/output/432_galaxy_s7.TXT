LENGTH: 206 words





[THE INVESTOR] Samsung Electronics, which forecast its best quarterly profit in

more than two years, is estimated to have sold about 26 million units of its

flagship smartphone Galaxy S7 that was launched in March.



In its second-quarter earnings guidance announced on July 7, the Korean tech

giant said it posted an operating profit of 8.1 trillion won (US$7 billion)

while its sales would come in at 50 trillion won.



Even though the company didn't break down earnings of individual business

divisions, the mobile business division, which makes up more than half of its

revenue, is expected to post a whopping 4 trillion won profit in the April-June

period.



Samsung's flagship smartphone Galaxy S7



Undoubtedly, the Galaxy S7 phones are driving up the company's robust sales in

recent months. The sales figure may still fall behind that of the company's

best-selling S4 that sold more than 70 million units in the first year alone.



Industry watchers say, however, in a fast-saturated market Samsung has made

efforts to improve profits, elevating sales portion of the more lucrative Edge

model with a curved display screen.



In the meantime, the company has also diversified its budget phone lineup to

increase phone sales overall.
