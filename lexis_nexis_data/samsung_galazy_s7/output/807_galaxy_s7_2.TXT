Technology bloggers and market analysts are always interested in the information

that continues making rounds online regarding newest smartphone models under

development at major technology companies. Interesting details have been

unveiled about the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Advanced. It is said that the

unannounced tablet is expected to have a 10-inch display with a resolution of

1,280 x 800 pixels.



As per rumors, there will be an octa-core processor and 2GB of RAM. Also, the

tablet will have the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system. Samsung's

offering is expected to come with 32 GB of on-board storage.



For users finding 32GB storage as less, there will be an option to expand the

storage capacity of the tablet. The Galaxy Tab 4 Advanced may also have

5-megapixel rear-facing and 2-megapixel front-facing cameras. It is also said

that the features, including autofocus, flash, and face detection that were not

present in the Galaxy Tab 4, will be present in the Advanced model.



The tablet is estimated to measure 243.4 x 176.4 x 7.9 mm and weigh 487 g.

Customers can expand the storage to up to 128 GB with a microSD card. Images

have been leaked of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Advanced and if they are true then

it is just a modest jump from its predecessor.



After going through the specifications, customers should hope that the Samsung

tablet will be available at a pocket-friendly price. Samsung is yet to confirm

any details about Galaxy Tab 4 Advanced.



"The moment came when I picked up my S7 off the glass coffee table where it had

been sitting. I can't say exactly how it happened, but the combination of me

stretching across the sofa, a poor finger-and-thumb grip, and the S7's slippery

curved front glass meant that, at about 10 inches above the table, it fell out

of my hand," according to a news report published by Tech Spot.



When the glass edge of the phone collided with the glass of the table I

initially didn't panic. It was, after all, a small fall. I'd already watched

YouTube video showing that while the S7 wasn't exactly durable, it can survive

drops from a much greater height. The caveat being, unfortunately, that the

device is very vulnerable if its edge hits a surface at a certain angle, which,

as my luck would have it, is exactly the way mine landed.



According to a report in Tech Times by Sumit Passary, "A Tech Times report

suggested that the Galaxy Tab 4 Advanced tablet was spotted at GFXBench with

model number SM-T536. The report highlighted that the unannounced tablet is

expected to sports a 10-inch display with a resolution of 1,280 x 800 pixels."



Rumors have also indicated that an octa-core processor and 2 GB of RAM will

power the Galaxy Tab 4 Advanced and the tablet will come running on the latest

Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system. The Samsung offering is expected to

come with 32 GB of on-board storage. Some tablet enthusiasts may not find the

storage sufficient and Samsung may address the issue with a microSD card slot,

which can be used for expanding the storage capacity of the tablet.



A report published in Androidcentral informed, "Samsung has launched the Galaxy

J5 2016 and the Galaxy J7 2016 in India. The Galaxy J5 is available in the

country for ?13,990, with the Galaxy J7 debuting at ?15,990. Both come with

Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box, offer 13MP cameras at the back and 5MP

front shooters, and feature a metal frame around the sides. The phones will be

up for sale starting later today on Flipkart."



The Galaxy J5 2016 offers a 5.2-inch 720p Super AMOLED display, 1.2GHz quad-core

Snapdragon 410 SoC, 2GB of RAM, 16GB internal memory, microSD slot (up to

128GB), and a 3100mAh battery. The Galaxy J7 2016 comes with a larger 5.5-inch

720p display, and is powered by a 1.6GHz octa-core Exynos 7870 SoC with 3GB of

RAM and 16GB storage along with a 3300mAh battery. The phones also come with LTE

connectivity, and feature the S Bike Mode that debuted on the Galaxy J3.
