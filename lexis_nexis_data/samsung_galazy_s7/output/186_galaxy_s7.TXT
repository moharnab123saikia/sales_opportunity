DATELINE: Bangladesh





Bangladesh, Dec. 15 -- Nine months is a long time in the smartphone industry, so

it should come as no surprise that Samsung is already preparing to launch the

next iteration of its flagship smartphone. While the Korean smartphone maker may

still be a few months away from showing us what's new, the Wall Street Journal

has already caught wind of some of the features we can expect to see in the

Galaxy S7. According to reporters, Samsung will include a "pressure-sensitive

display and a new high-speed charging port" in its new devices, which are slated

to launch in March.



The company is reportedly considering the inclusion of a retina scanner in some

versions of its new flagship, although that is not yet set in stone. Like the

Galaxy S6, Samsung will debut two models: the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.



With the inclusion of a pressure-sensitive display, Samsung looks set to follow

Apple, which is already touting "3D Touch" functionality. With a USB Type-C

port, the Galaxy S7 will charge significantly faster, with sources telling the

Wall Street Journal that devices will "allow for a full day's charge in under 30

minutes and in some cases significantly faster than that." An improved camera is

also said to be coming -- one that that performs better in low-light and sits

flat on the back of the device (the Galaxy S6 accommodated a small bump).



Overall, it doesn't appear that the Galaxy S7 family will differ that much from

last year's models. However, Samsung's new smartphone chief will hope that he

can gauge demand better than his predecessor and avoid making too many (or too

few) of its popular handsets. We can expect the Galaxy S7 family to make its

debut in or around Mobile World Congress, which opens on February 22nd, with the

handsets going on sale a couple of weeks later. The quick launch is said to be

deliberate: Samsung doesn't want to let any of its rivals steal a march this

time around.
