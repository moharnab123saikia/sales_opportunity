Rumors about the Samsung Galaxy S7 have been flooding the Internet ever since

the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge came out, but the latest one may be turn some

heads.



Recent rumors suggest that the Samsung Galaxy S7 may in fact be bringing back

the microSD expandable memory. Sources at the Italian Samsung Blog, HDBlog.it

claim that the Korean tech giant company will reintroduce the microSD slot in

the Samsung Galaxy S7, after removing it from the S6.



When Samsung dropped the expandable memory in the S6 earlier, it was faced with

a lot of criticism from the long time Galaxy users, who uniformly agreed that it

was a bad choice. Users lined up one after the other to complain about this step

as well. Rival companies also capitalized on this by proudly showcasing their

devices with SD card support, mainly LG and HTC.



It is highly likely that Samsung has had some serious discussions about the

possible return of the microSD slot in its flagship line. However, as it is

still a rumor, it is not to be believed blindly.
