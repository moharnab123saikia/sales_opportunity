Samsung held its unpacked event one day prior to MWC (Mobile World Congress)

2016 to announce its new flagship devices. The two new devices, Galaxy S7 and

Galaxy S7 Edge, improve upon their predecessor with new hardware and software

features.



The company has focused on major complains that users had with last year's

flagships -S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge plus and Note 5. Both the S7 and S7 Edge feature

expandable storage (up to 200GB cards supported, Hybrid SIM slot), larger

batteries and IP68 certification for dust and water resistance.



The other major change is the primary camera. Both phones feature a dual pixel

12MP sensor with a f1.7 apertures and 100% phase detection focus \xAD best

camera specifications on a smartphone.



Common hardware on both devices include an octa core/quad processor (Market

dependent), 4GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. Both phones feature super amoled

display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, fast charging support, wireless

charging and fingerprint scanner. While the Galaxy S7 comes with a 5.1-inch size

screen and a 3,000mAh battery, the S7 Edge has a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,600mAh

battery.



Samsung has also focused heavily on new user interface features. The phones come

with an Always on display feature using which you can have time, calendar or

other things visible on the screen always. A dedicated Game launcher is

preloaded which sorts our installed games, helps suggest similar games and shows

video trailers of the game.



No price and availability dates were announced. However, India will be amongst

the first countries to get the phone with an India launch expected next month

(March 2016). We expect the Galaxy S7 to be priced at ' . 50,000 approx and the

S7 Edge at ' . 60,000 approx.
