2016 to announce its new flagship devices. The two new devices, Galaxy S7 and
Galaxy S7 Edge, improve upon their predecessor with new hardware and software
features.

The company has focused on major complains that users had with last year's
flagships -S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge plus and Note 5. Both the S7 and S7 Edge feature
expandable storage (up to 200GB cards supported, Hybrid SIM slot), larger
batteries and IP68 certification for dust and water resistance.

The other major change is the primary camera. Both phones feature a dual pixel
12MP sensor with a f1.7 apertures and 100% phase detection focus \xAD best
camera specifications on a smartphone.

Common hardware on both devices include an octa core/quad processor (Market
dependent), 4GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. Both phones feature super amoled
display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, fast charging support, wireless
charging and fingerprint scanner. While the Galaxy S7 comes with a 5.1-inch size
screen and a 3,000mAh battery, the S7 Edge has a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,600mAh
battery.

Samsung has also focused heavily on new user interface features. The phones come
with an Always on display feature using which you can have time, calendar or
other things visible on the screen always. A dedicated Game launcher is
preloaded which sorts our installed games, helps suggest similar games and shows
video trailers of the game.

No price and availability dates were announced. However, India will be amongst
the first countries to get the phone with an India launch expected next month
(March 2016). We expect the Galaxy S7 to be priced at ' . 50,000 approx and the
S7 Edge at ' . 60,000 approx.
