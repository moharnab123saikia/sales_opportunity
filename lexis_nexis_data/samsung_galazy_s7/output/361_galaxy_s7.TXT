KUWAIT CITY, May 9: Virtual reality engine, pocket DSLR, supercomputer,

smart-key, gaming console and media powerhouse-the all-new Galaxy S7 wears many

tags with ease. The advanced capabilities and specifications of the smartphone

also brings with it unique challenges in order to deliver the ultimate user

experience. Smartphones getting overheated with extended use has been an

Achilles heel of sorts for the mobile phone industry. Unlike the conventional

systems before it, Samsung has succeeded in creating a super thin cooling

apparatus (0.6mm) for the powerful Exynos processor in the Galaxy S7 and S7

edge. A variation of the desktop water-cooling model, the cooling technology at

play in these smartphones keeps vital components like the processor working at

optimum temperature, greatly extending the lifespan and allowing for longer

uninterrupted usage.



Under the stunning metal shell of the S7 is flat copper piping that weaves

around the Graphics Processing Unit and the processor to dissipate the heat

generated by the phone. The piping ensures that the heat is evenly spread and

not concentrated on any specific spots.



Loosely described as the 'air conditioning for your phone', the piping has a

liquid that vaporizes at high temperatures and then condenses at low

temperatures. The liquid draws heat from the processor when vaporized and

repeats the cycle over and over again, converting from vapor to liquid and vice

versa depending on which component is hotter than the rest.



Supporting Vulkan API, the phones can run graphic intensive games such as

Asphalt 8 with ease. The S7 and S7 edge are powered by a 64 bit Octa core

(2.3GHz Quad + 1.6GHz Quad processor, mated with a Quad HD Super AMOLED screen

(5.1" 2560 X 1440 (577ppi) screen on the S7 and 5.5" Quad 2560 X 1440 (534ppi)

on the S7 Edge). The phone's Dual Pixel sensors, an industry first for mobile

camera technology mirror the human eyes' fast autofocus, setting the world

standard in low-light mobile camera technology.
