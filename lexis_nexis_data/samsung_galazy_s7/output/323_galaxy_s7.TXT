At the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona, Spain, a number of

Android-handset manufacturers -- including South Korean bigwigs Samsung and LG

-- are expected to unveil the next-generation versions of their flagship

devices.



Two of the most awaited Android-powered smartphones set to grab the spotlight at

the MWC event this year include Samsung's new Galaxy flagship handsets -- Galaxy

S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge -- and LG's newest G5 flagship smartphone.



The Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge handsets will mark a notable

improvement over their current-generation Galaxy S6 counterparts. The new

smartphones will boast a faster processor; more RAM; significantly improved

'Dual Pixel' 12-megapixel camera sensor camera; and support for microSD cards.



In addition, the new Galaxy handsets will also come with an 'Always On' display;

and very high resistance to dust and water, including submersion.



The LG G5 smartphone, meanwhile, is expected to stand out from the other

Android-powered handsets largely due to the introduction of a 'Magic Slot' which

will apparently support the plug-in of expansion devices.



Moreover, another distinguishing feature of the G5 will be a secondary rear

camera -- together with the standard lens -- capable of supporting 135 degree

wide angle photos. The G5 will also come with a low-power 'Always On' display,

to show the time and select notifications.
