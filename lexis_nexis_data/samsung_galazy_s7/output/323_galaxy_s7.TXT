

At the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2016 in Barcelona, Spain, a number of
Android-handset manufacturers -- including South Korean bigwigs Samsung and LG
-- are expected to unveil the next-generation versions of their flagship
devices.

Two of the most awaited Android-powered smartphones set to grab the spotlight at
the MWC event this year include Samsung's new Galaxy flagship handsets -- Galaxy
S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge -- and LG's newest G5 flagship smartphone.

The Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge handsets will mark a notable
improvement over their current-generation Galaxy S6 counterparts. The new
smartphones will boast a faster processor; more RAM; significantly improved
'Dual Pixel' 12-megapixel camera sensor camera; and support for microSD cards.

In addition, the new Galaxy handsets will also come with an 'Always On' display;
and very high resistance to dust and water, including submersion.

The LG G5 smartphone, meanwhile, is expected to stand out from the other
Android-powered handsets largely due to the introduction of a 'Magic Slot' which
will apparently support the plug-in of expansion devices.

Moreover, another distinguishing feature of the G5 will be a secondary rear
camera -- together with the standard lens -- capable of supporting 135 degree
wide angle photos. The G5 will also come with a low-power 'Always On' display,
to show the time and select notifications.
