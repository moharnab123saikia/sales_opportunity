
What's it got?

THE Galaxy S7 comes with a 13cm screen and the Edge has a 14cm screen.

The new dual edge display is something to be seen, especially when viewing
content on apps such as Flipboard and navigation bars.

The wrap-around display now supports two rows of apps instead of one and can be
customised according to the ones you use the most. You can also create folders
for quick access to similar apps.

The same screen space supports a beautiful looking 'news ticker' of headlines
and thumbnails down the right side.

The protruding camera, unpopular with some on the last model, has been cut to
just a 0.46mm blip.

SAMSUNG is rushing out the release of its new Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge
phones in Australia.

The devices, announced on the eve of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona along
with new gadgets from LG and Huawei, will go on sale from March 11.

The Galaxy S7 will have an Australian RRP of $1149 and the Galaxy S7 Edge will
sell for $1249.

Samsung's Gear 360 camera will launch in Australia later this year. Pricing has
not been revealed.

To sweeten the deal, Samsung will include its latest Gear VR headset for anyone
who buys the S7 or S7 Edge between February 26 and March 10.

Samsung Pay will be available in Australia later this year with partners
including American Express.

On Sunday night, LG threw out a big challenge to Samsung with a lighter and
cooler looking VR headset and a range of devices, including a DSLR camera
attachment.

Samsung's Australian vice president for mobile, Prasad Gokhale, said the S7 had
"fundamentally changed what a mobile device can offer".

"Meaningful innovation should deliver beautifully crafted technology that is
built to support the lifestyles of today's consumer," he said.

Samsung's mobile president DJ Koh said the new device offered "a world that is
brighter, sharper, more convenient, and more fun".
