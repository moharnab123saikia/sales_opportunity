The Active series is a ruggedized line of their standard Galaxy collection.



Samsung may have accidentaly revealed a new smartphone, and it looks like a

descendent of the ruggedized Galaxy S6 Active.



Spotted by SamMobile, the Galaxy S7 Active appears in a list of supported

devices for the Samsung Level app on the Google Play Store. The company's Active

series was first introduced in 2013 as a waterproof, shockproof counterpart to

the then flagship Galaxy S4.



What's strange is that Samsung has already included IP68 water and dust

resistance, leaving the possible S7 Active with only a ruggedized casing to

claim as a unique sell point, aside from the Active series' improved battery

over the standard line. There's no other real evidence there will even be a

Galaxy S7 Active, and Samsung has so far not confirmed any such device, so don't

hold your breath just yet.
