The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, two phones who have been at the center of the

rumor mill ever since the S6 and S6 Edge came out last March. If you wondered

what these phones might look like, the latest images of the devices have leaked.



Although its meant to be the next flagship from Samsung, it is missing out on

lot of the basics. These include a removable battery and microSD card support.

Thanks to Evan Blass, our trusted leakster, a new set of leaks show the first

press renders of the new devices. However, these leaked images do raise small

suspicions which make it feel like it is Photo-shopped. For example, the shape

looks deformed along the bottom of the fingerprint sensing home button on the

S7. The S7 Edge on the other hand, has a home button tilting downwards. Â The

camera sensor also appears to be larger on the S7 Edge.



However, if you were wondering why someone would go through the efforts of

faking this image, another leaked image earlier also shows a similar bent home

button. If these are to believed, the phones will be pure black in color, will

have new wallpapers and will measure 5.5 inches and 5.1 inches for the S7 Edge

and S7 respectively. There is also a lack of a USB Type-C port, and the design

looks identical.



Will the S7 and S7 Edge boast a new design, or will it just look like the

previous S6? Well, we can just wait till MWC to find out.
