On Thursday, bigwig South Korean electronics firm Samsung Electronics reported

its earnings for the 2116 January-March quarter, posting strong profits from its

mobile division. The mobile-profits gains reported by Samsung for the latest

quarter come after seven consecutive quarters of plunging profits.



According to the figures reported by Samsung, the company's profit in the 2016

first quarter stood at of 6.68 trillion won ($5.8 billion), underscoring a 12

percent increase over the profits figures it reported in the same quarter last

year.



The 2016 first-quarter profit reported by Samsung surpassed Bloomberg-compiled

average of analysts' estimates of a 5.53 trillion won profit.



The mobile division of Samsung Electronics recorded a 3.89 trillion won

operating profit; thereby marking a whopping 42 percent year-on-year increase.

The operating profit posted by Samsung's mobile division is the highest

operating profit to be reported by the division since the 2014 second quarter.



Samsung has said that a large part of the growth witnessed by its mobile

division in the 2016 first-quarter is a result of the robust sales of its

newest, March-launched flagship handsets --- Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. The

company expects strong sales of the two handsets in the next quarter as well.



Though Samsung has not officially disclosed the exact sales figures of its

latest handsets, Jay Yoo -- industry analyst at Korea Investment & Securities --

has projected that Galaxy S7 shipments in the reporting quarter touched nearly

9.7 million units.
