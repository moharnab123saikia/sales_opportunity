Samsung phones win battery test

Bangladesh, July 31 -- Looking for a new handset and hoping to base your

purchasing decision on the back of a phone's battery life credentials?



Samsung's battery test 2016 was won by Samsung phones.



Samsung's German division has posted a new video on YouTube that compares the

battery life of seven of the latest flagship smartphones, including the Samsung

Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. Also competing are the LG G5, the Huawei P9, the

Sony Xperia X, the HTC 10, and the iPhone 6S.



The test is a simple battery rundown, where all of the phones are charged to

full, given a task, and set against the clock. The phones die one by one until

there's a winner, which in this case turned out to be the Samsung Galaxy S7.

Here are the times, from worst to best, in HH:MM:SS format:



LG G5 (2,800mAh) - 06:31:49



Huawei P9 (3,000mAh) - 06:51:43



Sony Xperia X (2,620mAh) - 07:15:35



HTC 10 (3,000mAh) - 08:00:03



Apple iPhone 6S (1,715mAh) - 08:13:57



Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (3,600mAh) - 10:30:1



Samsung Galaxy S7 (3,000mAh) - 10:59:11



So it's clear that Samsung's Galaxy S7 is the winner by a decent margin. But

what's more interesting is comparing these rankings to a list of the same phones

ordered by the capacity of their batteries, from lowest to highest:



Apple iPhone 6S - 1,715mAh



Sony Xperia X - 2,620mAh



LG G5 - 2,800mAh



Huawei P9 - 3,000mAh



HTC 10 - 3,000mAh



Samsung Galaxy S7 - 3,000mAh



Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge - 3,600mAh



When you look at this way, some other observations become obvious. For instance,

the Huawei P9 has a bigger battery than three of the phones, and the same

battery as three of the phones, and yet it came second to last in the battery

tests, suggesting sub-par optimisation.



Perhaps the biggest achievement is the Apple iPhone 6S, which came second only

to the Samsung phones in terms of battery performance, despite having the

smallest cell by far. That's no surprise, mind.



The iPhone always performs well for battery life compared to battery size due to

the optimisation of its software and hardware - Apple designs one OS for one

phone, and builds its chip to suit that OS.



It's also worth noting that display pixel density has a significant effect on

battery life, and the iPhone 6S has the lowest screen resolution of all the

phones on the list, according to news agencies.
