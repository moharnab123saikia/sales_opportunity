Samsung says Canadians with Galaxy Note 7 smartphones can start returning the

devices as of Thursday as part of a global safety recall following reports of

overheating batteries that pose a fire hazard. Samsung Electronics Canada Inc.

of Mississauga, Ont., has advised consumers to return the phones to the stores

where they were bought. Devices returned to retailers and carriers can be

exchanged for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge phone, or customers can opt for a

full refund for the recalled Note 7s and specific accessories. Samsung. com

customers are being offered a refund upon receipt of the Galaxy Note 7s. The

South Korean electronics giant said Tuesday it would stop making and selling the

Note 7s and advised owners to turn off and stop using the smartphones.
