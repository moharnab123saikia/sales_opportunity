Chinese smartphone manufacturers came on strong in the third quarter, grabbing

market share from Samsung and Apple (AAPL).



Worldwide smartphone shipments rose 1% to 362.9 million units in Q3. But the top

two vendors both lost ground to Chinese upstarts, research firm IDC said late

Wednesday.



No. 1 vendor Samsung shipped 72.5 million smartphones in Q3, down 13.5% year

over year. Samsung's market share declined to 20% from 23.3% a year earlier as

it was stung by the recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 handset. IDC excluded

Galaxy Note 7 shipments from its totals.



"The continued success of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge helped (Samsung) maintain

volumes in Q3 despite the recall and negative publicity of the Note 7 fiasco,"

IDC said in a report. "Outside of Samsung's flagship S7, the more affordable

J-series of devices continued to steadily drive volume in both developed and

emerging markets with flagship-styled devices across various price points and

display sizes."



No. 2 vendor Apple shipped 45.5 million iPhones in Q3, down 5.3% from a year

earlier. Its market share dipped to 12.5% from 13.4% over the same period, IDC

reported.



Apple was aided by the Sept. 16 release of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.



IBD'S TAKE: Outside of Apple, the only way for investors to play the smartphone

market is to invest in component suppliers. One such company, chipmaker

Broadcom, is on the IBD 50 list of top stocks.



After Samsung and Apple, the largest smartphone vendors in Q3 were Chinese

vendors Huawei (9.3% market share), OPPO (7%) and Vivo (5.8%), IDC said.



Huawei, OPPO and Vivo sell handsets with top-shelf features at a fraction of the

cost of those from Samsung and Apple, IDC said.



"Phones like the OPPO R9 and the Vivo X7 have become serious competitors in

China and are also witnessing mild success in Western Europe thanks to new

athletic sponsorships across various countries," IDC said. "Whether or not these

brands can make an impact in the U.S. market remains to be seen, but success

will be crucial if aspirations of growth are a top priority."



On a year-over-year basis, Huawei increased its smartphone unit shipments by

23%. OPPO and Vivo grew at a triple-digit pace, up 121.6% and 102.5%,

respectively, in Q3, IDC said.



Huawei's Honor brand found success with the new V8 handset. The midtier device

sold well both in and outside of China.



Huawei has a strong brand in Europe and has done well with its P8 and P9

devices, where it is taking share from Samsung and Apple with competitive specs

at lower prices, IDC said.



Huawei is now focused on the U.S. It is planning a New York unveiling of its

next Mate series flagship phone (Mate 9) in early November.



Research firm Strategy Analytics in a report Thursday estimated that global

smartphone shipments rose 6% year over year to 375.4 million units in Q3.



It ranked the top five smartphone vendors as Samsung (20.1% market share), Apple

(12.1%), Huawei (9%), OPPO (5.8%), and Vivo (4.9%).



Apple fell 1% to 114.48 in the stock market today after losing more than 2%

Wednesday following its Tuesday night earnings report.
