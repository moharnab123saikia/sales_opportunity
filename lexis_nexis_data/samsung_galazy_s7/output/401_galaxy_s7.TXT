Samsung has recently launched its next Flagship product-line - the Galaxy S7,

Galaxy S7 Edge and Edge Plus. This innovative range of smartphones is enriched

with powerful camera features, Octa Core processor, 4GB RAM and Android

Marshmallow Operating System, to ensure superior performance, on-the-go. The

Galaxy S7 introduces a technologically innovated and powerful 12.2 Mega Pixel

camera that uses 56 percent bigger pixels, with an enhanced capacity to let in

25 percent more light. This reduces the strain on the processor, enabling you to

capture sharp and vivid pictures, with more ease and speed. The device is also

enriched with an 8 MP Front-facing camera for sharper Selfies and a Dual Video

call feature.



The Auto-Focus has also been improved substantially, as Samsung's new Dual-Pixel

Sensor Technology (BRITECELL) offers lightning-quick sharpness - bringing the

camera at par with the high-performance, premium devices, while the Optical

Image-Stabilizing technology ensures great results and clearer imaging, even

with a shaky hand.
