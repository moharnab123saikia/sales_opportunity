Blayne Slabbert tests the latest Samsung devices to see if they are worth the

upgrade and financial outlay.



--------------------



The details Both Samsung phones are available in stores now. The S7 costs $1199

(32GB) while the S7 Edge costs $1399 (32GB).



--------------------



Samsung's latest phones are great - they're fast, good-looking, waterproof and

have an excellent camera. There is little doubt about their abilities, but is it

worth upgrading to a Galaxy S7 (5.1-inch) or S7 Edge (5.7-inch) from your

current smartphone model?



That depends on what you've got, what you need and how much money you ca spend.

Here are six reasons to upgrade your device:



You must have the latest tech



This is the greatest smartphone Samsung has made.



It's got the best from last year's model while fixing a few problems with the S6

range, such as expandable storage (up to 200GB extra).



However, you might pause when it comes to their design, especially for the S7

Edge, with its distinctive curved screen.



When it came out last year, it was the most innovative looking phone around, but

this year's model looks the same, which means there's less need to have the

"latest-looking" phone.



Your phone is your camera



The camera on the S6 is fantastic. It's almost impossible to take a bad photo

when the conditions are good.



Smartphone cameras are one area that is improving each year as competitors push

one another to have the best tech.



Samsung has a few new features inspired by others including "live photos" and

being able to use the screen as a flash when taking selfies at night.



It also has new tech (dual pixel sensor) to make focusing more accurate and

faster in low light. This makes quite a bit of difference and the S7 easily

outperforms an iPhone 6 when shifting focus from one subject to another.



You are clumsy around water



Having a waterproof phone is by no means a necessity, but it's good to know your

$1000-plus investment is safe if you're taking a photo in the rain or have a

slip when you're near the pool.



The tech used (sealing from the inside) is clever and a step toward making

phones more durable, but it's probably not enough of a reason alone to buy one.

Consider it a bonus feature.



Your phone is old



If your device is more than a few years old then using one of the latest phones

will blow you away. The screens are so sharp and clear and they whiz along

without a hint of lag.



The Samsung S7 range has a new processor and 4GB of RAM to make it faster than

its predecessor and also features fast-charging tech along with a longer-lasting

battery and the latest version of Android. You won't find this on your

3-year-old device, and trying a new phone (not just a Samsung) will be a digital

delight.



Also, moving from an older 4-inch phone to one with a bigger screen makes a lot

of difference if you use it a lot to read or to watch videos.



You use your phone as your watch



The new phones feature an Always On function, which means time time, date and

battery level show even when the phone is turned off. It's only a small thing,

but it is handy if you are always pulling your phone out to check the time.



However, the Samsung S7 range is not without its shortcomings.



You are interested in virtual reality



VR is one of the coolest things in tech at the moment and you can pair one of

these phones (or the S6 range) with a headset to experience it at an affordable

price.



The Samsung Gear VR costs about $300 and takes viewing movies or games to a

whole new level.



However, nothing is perfect - so here are three reasons not to upgrade:



They cost between $1199 and $1399



That's a lot to spend on a phone, especially when you can get a Galaxy S5 for

$600. That's a good phone though it's a bit plasticky compared to its younger

siblings.



You do get a lot of tech for your money, but you can save yourself a lot of

money if you can handle not having the latest device with all the best features.



The Samsung version of Android



Many smartphone companies put their own tweak on the Android operating system by

adding in extra features.



I prefer the pure version of Android which can be found on many phones,

including Google's Nexus range.



This alone shouldn't put you off buying a Samsung phone as you can hide a lot of

the installed apps. It's just a bit of a hassle.



There's plenty of other great options



All the top manufacturers make excellent devices and if you're looking at

high-end phones then there's a lot to choose from.



There's not a huge difference between them, and a lot comes down to personal

taste around design and branding. If you are an Android fan, Huawei, LG and Sony

have just released devices (though not all are available here yet).
