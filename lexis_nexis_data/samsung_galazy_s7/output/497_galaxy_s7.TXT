Samsung Electronics Co is deploying a new strategy that's being credited for

making the Galaxy S7 smartphone a surprise hit since its debut in March:

Releasing it sooner and pricing it cheaper.



Sales of the company's top-end lineup are estimated to reach 9 million units

during their first month on the market[#xff0d]or triple those of the S6 models

in the same time frame last year. That's prompting analysts to raise their

projections for operating profit and revenue when Samsung reports preliminary

first-quarter earnings on Thursday, even as its marquee device with a wraparound

screen is as much 8 percent cheaper than last year's device.



The world's biggest smartphone maker scrapped its practice of raising prices

with each new model, a ploy long used by Apple Inc, as it tries to counter

flattening sales growth. While Samsung's chip and display businesses probably

will suffer as a result, sales of the S7 devices are being energized by critical

praise, a lull in new models from Chinese makers and the lack of an iPhone 7 to

sway upgraders and first-time buyers.



"With the high-end smartphone market largely stagnated, the issue is no longer

about what 'Wow' features the new phone has," said Claire Kim, a Seoul-based

analyst at Daishin Securities Co. "Rather, it's about who can bring out the

phone quicker."



The S7 lineup was released March 11, about a month sooner than the S6 models

that went on sale in April 2015. The phones look similar, one with a 5.1-inch

screen and the other with a 5.5-inch screen wrapping around the edges, yet the

new models include a memory-card slot, waterproofing and a longer estimated

battery life.
