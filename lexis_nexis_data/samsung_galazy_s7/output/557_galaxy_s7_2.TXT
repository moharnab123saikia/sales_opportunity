Samsung's aggressive marketing is also playing a role in attracting new

customers.



The Gear Fit 2, worth 198,000 won (US$177), is offered as a gift for a new Note

purchase. The company pays 50 percent of the repair costs when the screen is

broken. A 100,000-won gift card is also given for use at Samsung Pay Mall.



Samsung operates some 2,800 Note experience zones across the nation, which

compares to some 2,000 for the Galaxy S7.



The company aims to attract premium customers before the upcoming launch of

Apple's next iPhone possibly in September.



The Galaxy Note 7 will be launched on Aug. 19 globally. The price starts from

988,900 won here.
