Barcelona, June 3 -- Building the heat at the ongoing Mobile World Congress

(MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, the leading Korean smartphone maker Samsung released

its flagship smartphone Galaxy S7, its curved-screen companion Galaxy S7 Edge

and Gear 360 camera that will take the high-end smartphone war to a new high.





 According to the tech website www.igalaxys7.com, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge

will be available in India with a reported price of Rs 53000 and Rs 60000,

respectively. The smartphones are expected to hit the market by mid-March this

year.

 "We believe in a world that is brighter, sharper, more convenient, and more

fun. We strive to deliver on that vision with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge

by marrying elegant design with functionality and providing a seamless mobile

experience," DJ Koh, president of mobile communications business, Samsung

Electronics, said in a statement released on the first day of three-day MWC that

began on Sunday.

 Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg also made a surprised appearance

during the launch, announcing that his company and Samsung are teaming up to

push virtual reality (VR) features in smartphones and social networking

experience.

 The 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 edge are constructed with 3D

glass and metal and given ergonomic curves for a comfortable grip.

 The new Galaxy devices look similar to its predecessors Galaxy S6. The Galaxy

S7 Edge features curves on all four sides.

 The device's new Always-On Display gives users a simplified, zero touch

experience to check about a miss call or SMS. Both the devices are IP68 water

and dust resistant.

 The new phones have advanced cameras for high-quality images.

 The company has introduced the first dual pixel camera on Galaxy S7 and Galaxy

S7 edge smartphones, delivering brighter and sharper images even in low light.

The Dual Pixel technology gives clear photos with a brighter lens with wider

aperture and bigger pixel.

 The camera has a faster shutter speed and a more accurate autofocus even in

low-light conditions.

 Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge deliver fast wired and wireless charging

technology. Additionally, the hybrid SIM card tray allows users to insert a

microSD card for up to 200GB of additional storage.

 Samsung also made significant hardware and software updates to optimise gaming

performance on Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge.

 The Samsung Galaxy S7 runs on an Octa core (2.3GHz Quad + 1.6GHz Quad), 64 bit

processor and has a 4GB RAM.

 It has a 2560 X 1440 (534ppi) 5.1-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display with Dual

Pixel 12-megapixel (F1.7) rear and 5-megapixel (F1.7) cameras.

 Meanwhile, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge runs on an Quadcore (2.15GHz Dual + 1.6GHz

Dual), 64 bit processor and has a 4GB RAM.

 It has a 2560 X 1440 (577ppi) 5.5-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display with Dual

Pixel 12-megapixel (F1.7) rear and 5-megapixel (F1.7) cameras.

 Both phones runs on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) operating system.

 The powerful processer and bigger battery capacity (3,000mAh in Galaxy S7 and

3,600mAh in Galaxy S7 Edge ) ensure longer playing time, and the internal

cooling system keeps the device from overheating.

 The smartphones have an enhanced Galaxy experience in VR apps and games.

"Together, this is by far the best mobile VR experience you can offer,"

Zuckerberg added.

 The devices are protected by Samsung KNOX, fingerprint scanning and advanced

tokenization and have NFC (Near Field Communication), MST (Magnetic Secure

Transmission) and Barcode technology, making mobile payments easy.

 Samsung also unveiled a new spherical camera called the Gear 360 that connects

to Samsung's phones to capture, view and share 360-degree video and still

images. The device is designed to supplement Samsung's Gear VR headset and

related software.
