Samsung Electronics to use Qualcomm chips for some Galaxy S7 phones: Electronic

Times



LENGTH: 174  words





Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will use Qualcomm Inc's mobile processors for some of

its upcoming flagship Galaxy S smartphones, South Korea's Electronic Times

reported on Friday citing unnamed industry sources.



The paper said Samsung will use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 chips for the Galaxy

S7 phones, which are expected to launch early next year and which will be sold

in the United States and China. Galaxy S7 phones sold in other markets will be

powered by Samsung's own Exynos processors, the paper said.



A Samsung spokeswoman said the firm does not comment on rumors or speculation.

Qualcomm could not be immediately reached for comment.



The South Korean firm used only its Exynos processors for the flagship Galaxy S6

smartphones this year, dealing a major blow to the U.S. chipmaker. But Samsung

said earlier this year that it could opt to use Qualcomm chips in the future.



Samsung has previously sourced mobile processors from both Qualcomm and through

its own chips division for its premium devices including its Galaxy S and Galaxy

Note series.
