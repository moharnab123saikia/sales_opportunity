its upcoming flagship Galaxy S smartphones, South Korea's Electronic Times
reported on Friday citing unnamed industry sources.

The paper said Samsung will use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 chips for the Galaxy
S7 phones, which are expected to launch early next year and which will be sold
in the United States and China. Galaxy S7 phones sold in other markets will be
powered by Samsung's own Exynos processors, the paper said.

A Samsung spokeswoman said the firm does not comment on rumors or speculation.
Qualcomm could not be immediately reached for comment.

The South Korean firm used only its Exynos processors for the flagship Galaxy S6
smartphones this year, dealing a major blow to the U.S. chipmaker. But Samsung
said earlier this year that it could opt to use Qualcomm chips in the future.

Samsung has previously sourced mobile processors from both Qualcomm and through
its own chips division for its premium devices including its Galaxy S and Galaxy
Note series.
