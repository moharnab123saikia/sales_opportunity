No S7 Edge+ for UK customers

Samsung fans in the UK will not be getting the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge+, and

instead will be getting the Galaxy Note 6, as the brand's chief phablet in the

UK.



According to a source from UK's highest major networks, Samsung is taking this

decision due to a "backlash from loyal Note fans". Samsung did not launch the

Samsung Galaxy Note 5 in Europe last year, and the decision was met with huge

disappointment from loyal Samsung fans.



"Samsung isn't going to launch the S7 Edge+ in the UK," says the source, who

continued "I got the impression that it had been a bit of a disappointment

sales-wise and that the decision to keep the Note 5 out of Europe is now

considered a mistake. So our information is that the Note 6 will launch in the

UK in August and that there will be no S7 Edge+."



This could probably mean that the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge+ might be being killed

off globally after just one version, or probably just in the UK markets. This

could also be part of Samsung's plan to position the smaller Galaxy S7 Edge a

little differently, making it bigger than the S7 and smaller than the Note 6.

Samsung could also be choosing which regions to launch the S7 Edge+ in.



When asked, Samsung said that it cannot comment on rumor and speculation. The S7

will be launched at MWC 2016 on February 21st, and will go on sale soon after.
