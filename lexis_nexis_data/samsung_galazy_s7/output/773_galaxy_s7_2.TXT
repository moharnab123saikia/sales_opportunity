Samsung is set to announce the Galaxy Note 7 in August and while there have been
rumours suggesting that the phone will come with an IP68 rating which means that
it should be waterproof, we have heard from a reliable source that the upcoming
phablet will not be water-proof.

The Galaxy S7 features a water-proof design which has led many to believe that
the upcoming Galaxy Note 7 will follow suit. However, considering the fact that
the Samsung Galaxy Note comes with a compartment housing the S-Pen, you could
see the challenges in trying to seal that off against water.

The highlight features of the Samsung Note 7 are expected to be an iris scanner
as well as dual back cameras. Some rumours indicate that the new Note might also
feature a dual curved screen like the S7 as well as bring back the MicroSD slot.
Finally, Samsung is also expected to increase battery capacity to 4000mAh.

We'll only find out which of these features make it to the device when it is
officially announced.
