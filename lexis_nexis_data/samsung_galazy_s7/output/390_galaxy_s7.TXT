Rumors of the S7 keep coming



By tbreak Staff -



The Samsung Galaxy S7 has been the center of many rumors recently, but there

have not been any official product images. However, some images leaked recently

which are supposedly the chassis of the new phone.



The images leaked on to Weibo, and was captioned as a "not yet released flagship

phone". People are putting two and two together and coming up with speculations

regarding the S7. From the design it's obvious that there is not going to be

much of a change from the Galaxy S6. From the images, we can see that there are

not much changes in the new device, expect for the edges being a bit more

rounded.



Industry analysts expect that Samsung will be focusing more on improving the

internal specs of the device rather than revamping the phone's look. Other

rumors suggest that the handset will be coming in two sizes, a 5.2 inch screen

and a 5.8 inch screen, for hands of all sizes. An update for the camera is

expected as well, in terms of quality and capabilities. Rumors also suggest that

there might be a brand new internal liquid cooling system as well.



The Samsung Galaxy S7 is expected to come out at Mobile World Congress at the

end of February next year, but others think it will arrive as early as January.
