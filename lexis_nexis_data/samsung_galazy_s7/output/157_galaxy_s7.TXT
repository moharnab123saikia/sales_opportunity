If you've been eagerly anticipating the arrival of Samsung's Galaxy S7, the wait

is over as it's finally landed in stores today.



The new Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have plenty of new features including a new

water-resistant design, an SD card slot for expandable memory, and a big enough

battery to watch 12 hours of HD video in a single charge.
