New devices have refined design, advanced cameras and streamlined software

functionality





Samsung Electronics launched the newest additions to the Galaxy family of

products - the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge ­ in Oman last week. Created for

today's con­ sumer lifestyle, the two devices lead the industry with a refined

design, more advanced camera, streamlined software functionality and

unparalleled connectivity to a galaxy of products, services and experiences.







Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge introduce the first Dual Pixel cam­ era on a

smartphone, delivering brighter and sharper images, even in low light. Thanks to

Dual Pixel technology, brighter lens with wider aperture, and bigger pixel, the

camera has a faster shutter speed and a more accurate autofocus even in

low­light condi­ tions. Motion Panorama, a new camera mode, brings movement to

traditional panoramic photos, giv­ ing the user an immersive vis­ ual

experience.



Refined design and function

The 5.1­inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5­ inch Galaxy S7 edge are construct­ ed with 3D

glass and metal in a sleek design with durability and ergonomic curves for a

comfort­ able grip. From work to play, the devices' new Always­On Display gives

users a simplified, zero touch experience where they don't need to worry about

missing a call or important notification.



Without compromising design, both the devices have increased utility with IP68

water and dust resistance. Edge UX, the advanced edge experience available in

Galaxy S7 edge, provides conven­ ience and increased efficiency by creating easy

shortcuts to users' favourite functions such as email, selfie mode, panorama

mode or third party applications.



Enhanced performance

The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge deliver fast wired and wireless charging

technology. Additionally, the hybrid SIM card tray allows users to insert a

microSD card for up to 200gb of additional storage and in some select coun­

tries, the tray can be used with a dual SIM card.



Samsung also made significant hardware and software updates to opti­ mise gaming

perform­ ance on Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. The pow­ erful processor and big­

ger battery capacity ensure longer playing time, and the internal cooling system

keeps the device from overheating. Game Launcher, a new add­on for gamers,

allows users to manage battery consumption and minimise notifications.

Additionally, users can record their gaming experience or share their screen to

play with oth­ ers. Paired with Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, Vulkan API gives

users the ability to play high­performance grap­ hic games with lower bat­ tery

consumption. The Galaxy experience

Samsung Gulf Electronics has also announced the launch of the Galaxy Entertainer

application in conjunction with the launch of the flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 edge

smartphones. The partner­ ship with the Entertainer max­ imises the user

experience for consumers in the Gulf region, by offering more than 1,000 'buy

one get one free' offers that pro­ vides unparalleled access to sev­ eral global

hotspots including restaurants, cafes, premium spas, leisure attractions, golf

courses, luxury hotels and more.



The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge are now available at all major retailers in

Oman. The rec­ ommended retail price for Galaxy S7 is RO270, while the Galaxy S7

edge is available for RO300.
