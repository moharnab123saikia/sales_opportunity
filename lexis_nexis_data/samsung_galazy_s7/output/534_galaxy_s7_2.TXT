Smartphone vendors shipped a total of 343.3 million smartphones worldwide in the

second quarter (Q2) this year, up 3.1 percent from the first quarter (Q1), a

shipment relatively flat compared to the 342.4 million units in the same period

last year, according to a report released by consulting company International

Data Corporation (IDC) on Thursday.



Samsung Electronics Co Ltd retained its leadership as it did in Q1, shipping 77

million smartphones and capturing 22.4 percent of the market, surpassing the

Apple Inc and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd combined.



The IDC said Samsung's market performance was fueled by the success of the new

Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge flagship handsets.



Apple, which retained the second spot by claiming 11.8 percent of the market,

shipped 40.4 million iPhones in Q2, declining 15 percent year-on-year from the

47.5 million units shipped last year and marking its lowest quarterly volume in

seven quarters.



"For Apple, the second quarter is seasonally its lowest of the year as consumers

hold off on purchases in anticipation of the next big launch in the third

quarter," the IDC said.



Ryan Reith, program vice-president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device

Trackers, said Apple started putting more emphasis on "Device as a Service" to

try to prevent lengthening replacement cycles.



Huawei, which kept its third position, shipped 32.1 million units, capturing 9.4

percent of the market. The IDC said the company's sales in Europe performed even

stronger than in domestic market.



Chinese company Oppo Electronics Corp and Vivo Mobile Communication Technology

Co Ltd took fourth and fifth positions respectively as they did in Q1, shipping

22.6 million and 16.4 million units, pushing out previous fourth and fifth place

players Lenovo Group Ltd and Xiaomi Corp.



"As smartphone prices continue to drop and competition escalates at the

high-end, vendors will need to continue to push 'flagship-type' devices at

affordable price points to encourage upgrading on a more frequent basis," said

Anthony Scarsella, mobile phones research manager of the IDC.



He said Chinese smartphone brands have hit a sweet spot by launching premium

styled devices that focus on the features that matter most to consumers.



In addition, Reith said low-end Chinese original equipment manufacturers are

successfully penetrating overseas markets as the growth of Chinese market slows

down and competitions in high growth markets like India, Indonesia, and Middle

East heat up.
