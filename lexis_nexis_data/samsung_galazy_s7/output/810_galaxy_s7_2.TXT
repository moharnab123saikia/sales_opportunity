Samsung has released Canadian details for the 10-country recall of2.5 million

Galaxy Note 7 smartphones following reports that some of their batteries have

exploded or caught fire. Samsung Electronics Canada says there has been no

confirmed incident in this country, but it ' s offering a voluntary exchange

program for its Canadian customers. Samsung ' s parent company said last week

that it would set up a product exchange after it confirmed 35 cases of Note 7s

that exploded or caught fire due to defective batteries from one supplier.

Owners of the phone in Canada can exchange their Galaxy Note 7 for a new one.

The company says another option is to exchange the phone for a Galaxy S7 or

Galaxy S7 Edge through the carrier or retailer that sold the device.
