

According to Samsung Customer Care, Samsung Pay will be available in Canada
within days

Twitter user Saifali Maknojiya reportedly posed a question to a Samsung customer
service representative through its built-in app and received a response that
Samsung Pay, the company&#39;s competitor to Android Pay and Apple Pay, would
launch in Canada in the first week of November.

According to the representative, the service will first launch with CIBC Visa
cards. However, it is unclear when the service will expand to other banks and
payment providers.

Samsung claimed earlier this year that Samsung Pay would hit Canada in 2016. It
also targeted launches in the UK, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Thailand by the end of
the year.

Samsung Pay currently works with Galaxy S7 edge, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S6 edge+,
Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 edge, Galaxy S6 active, Galaxy S6, and Gear S2.
