WITH Samsung stopping sales and replacements of its Galaxy Note 7, many buyers

will be left wondering what phone they should be switching to.



Here are finder.com.au's top picks for large screened, premium 2016 smartphones.



1. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge



If you want to stay with Samsung, the Galaxy S7 Edge is a great contender with

the same large, curved display screen as the Note 7 and a very similar overall

performance.



2. Huawei Mate 8



The Mate 8 has some decent features, a large screen along with excellent battery

life and performance. It also has a refined rounded design that's similar to the

Note 7's display.



3. Apple iPhone 7 Plus



So this isn't an Android option, but it's still one you should consider if a

large screen is what you're after. Be warned, not all storage variants of the

iPhone 7 Plus come in cheaper than the Note 7 on either an outright or contract

basis.



4. Google Pixel XL



If you're committed to Android, Google's upcoming Pixel XL might be more to your

tastes. It boasts Google's own in-built "Assistant" and a seriously sharp

camera. Pixel XL will be on sale from October 20.
