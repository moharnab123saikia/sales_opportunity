launch at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on February 21 - shows
that the smartphone is waterproof and has a wireless charging feature. Samsung's
Indonesian arm appears to have shown off the Galaxy S7 almost a week earlier
than planned. An unlisted commercial posted to its YouTube channel shows
Indonesian archer Dellie Threesyadinda training while using the new phone, tech
website The Verge reported.

In the video, Threesyadinda is seen operating a smartphone similar in design to
the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, in a downpour, suggesting a return to waterproofing.
The phone is also seen being used with a wireless charging pad. The smartphones
are rumoured to have metal and glass design, but may come at the sacrifice of
power user features. The Galaxy S7 Edge may come with a larger 5.5-inch display
(the regular S7 will remain at 5.1 inches).

Both the S7 and S7 Edge will likely retain the resolution of 1440x2560 as their
predecessors with Super AMOLED displays. Samsung is likely to again offer 32 GB
and 64 GB options for internal storage and may launch a 128 GB version.
VentureBeat reported in January that the S7 will include a 3,000mAh battery, up
from the S6's 2550 mAh and the S7 Edge may sport a 3600 mAh battery. It is also
rumoured that phones might see a "downgrade" in camera resolution but offer
f/1.7 aperture to perform even better in low light settings.
