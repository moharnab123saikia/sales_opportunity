If you want a smartphone for a fraction of the eye-watering sums they currently

fetch, then you're in luck.



Mobile phone giant Samsung is reportedly set to launch a a smartphone

refurbishment service, allowing people to buy second-hand handsets for reduced

prices.



The company is set to refurbish high-end phone, according to the reports, which

have been returned to the company by customers who sign up for its one-year

upgrade programme.



A person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters devices are likely to

include Samsung's flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, as well as the Galaxy Note 7,

which went on sale last week.



Samsung will then re-sell these phones at a lower price - but nobody knows how

big the discount would be, or how many refurbished devices Samsung expected to

sell.



It is thought the service, which is being launched to maximise its operating

margins and fend-off competition from lower-cost rivals, could launch in markets

as early as next year.



Samsung's biggest rival Apple already sells refurbished iPhones in a number of

markets, but does not disclose sales figures.



These have a re-sale value of around 69 per cent of their original price a year

after launch.
