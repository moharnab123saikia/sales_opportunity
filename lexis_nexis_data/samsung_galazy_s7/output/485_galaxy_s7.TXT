fetch, then you're in luck.

Mobile phone giant Samsung is reportedly set to launch a a smartphone
refurbishment service, allowing people to buy second-hand handsets for reduced
prices.

The company is set to refurbish high-end phone, according to the reports, which
have been returned to the company by customers who sign up for its one-year
upgrade programme.

A person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters devices are likely to
include Samsung's flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, as well as the Galaxy Note 7,
which went on sale last week.

Samsung will then re-sell these phones at a lower price - but nobody knows how
big the discount would be, or how many refurbished devices Samsung expected to
sell.

It is thought the service, which is being launched to maximise its operating
margins and fend-off competition from lower-cost rivals, could launch in markets
as early as next year.

Samsung's biggest rival Apple already sells refurbished iPhones in a number of
markets, but does not disclose sales figures.

These have a re-sale value of around 69 per cent of their original price a year
after launch.
