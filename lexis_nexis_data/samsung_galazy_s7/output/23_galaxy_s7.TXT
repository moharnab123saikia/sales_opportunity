BARCELONA - Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd announced the newest additions to the

Galaxy family of products, Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge at the ongoing

Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Spain on Sunday. Created for today's consumer

lifestyle, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge lead the industry with a refined design,

more advanced camera, streamlined software functionality and unparalleled

connectivity to a galaxy of products, services, and experiences.



"We believe in a world that is brighter, sharper, more convenient, and more fun.

We strive to deliver on that vision with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge by

marrying elegant design with functionality and providing a seamless mobile

experience," said DJ Koh, President of Mobile Communications Business, Samsung

Electronics. "We empower consumers with technology to help them get more out of

life and will continue to push the frontier of what's possible."



Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge introduce the first Dual Pixel camera on a

smartphone, delivering brighter and sharper images, even in low light. Thanks to

the revolutionary Dual Pixel technology, brighter lens with wider aperture, and

bigger pixel, the camera has a faster shutter speed and a more accurate

autofocus even in low-light conditions. Motion Panorama, a new camera mode,

brings movement to traditional panoramic photos, giving the user a completely

immersive visual experience.



The 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 and 5.5-inch Galaxy S7 edge are constructed with 3D glass

and metal - all in a sleek design with durability and ergonomic curves for a

comfortable grip. From work to play, the device's new Always-On Display, gives

users a simplified, zero touch experience where they don't need to worry about

missing a call or important notification.



Without compromising design, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge both have increased

utility with IP68 water and dust resistance. Edge UX, the advanced edge

experience available on Galaxy S7 edge, provides convenience and increased

efficiency by creating easy shortcuts to users' most loved functions such as

email, selfie mode, panorama mode or third party applications.



Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge deliver fast wired and wireless charging

technology. Additionally, the hybrid SIM card tray allows users to insert a

microSD card for up to 200GB of additional storage and in some select countries,

the tray can be used with a dual SIM card.



Samsung also made significant hardware and software updates to optimize gaming

performance on Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. The powerful processor and bigger

battery capacity ensure longer playing time, and the internal cooling system

keeps the device from overheating. Game Launcher, a new add-on for gamers,

allows users to manage battery consumption and minimize notifications.

Additionally, users can record their gaming experience or share their screen to

play with others. Paired with Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, Vulkan API gives

users the ability to play high-performance graphic games with lower battery

consumption. - SG
