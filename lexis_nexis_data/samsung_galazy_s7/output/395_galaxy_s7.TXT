After hitting success with the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, it was no surprise
that rumors of the Samsung Galaxy S7 started making their rounds.

Recent rumors suggest that the latest flagship from Samsung, the Samsung Galaxy
S7, may be coming out with a new and improved camera. The exceptional camera was
the main reason for the success of the Galaxy S6 and its Edge variant, so it was
only wise that Samsung decides to improve upon it. At a recent Samsung
Electronics 2015 Investors Forum, the company unveiled the Britecell, a new
sensor that promises improved low light performance with less color artifacts.

The new sensor will have smaller one micron sensors which will also allow
Samsung to reduce the height of the camera module by 17 percent, thus allowing
the company to produce slimmer phones without compromising on the camera. In the
Britecell, Samsung looks to replace the green pixels in a traditional Bayer
filter pattern in the RGB technology with white pixels. Through this
arrangement, the camera sensor can pick more light, even in low light
situations.

It is safe bet that we can see the Britecell in the Samsung Galaxy S7, which is
reportedly due in February next year. However, Samsung is yet to confirm which
other smartphones will get the superior camera technology.
