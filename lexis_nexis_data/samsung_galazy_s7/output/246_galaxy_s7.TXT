Samsung's flagship phablet, Galaxy Note 7 has been officially announced and

packs terrific hardware and features inside its 5.7-inch screen



If you haven't yet upgraded to a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge, then a Galaxy Note

7 was probably the device that you've been waiting for. Samsung pointed out that

the company's designers and engineers were having difficulty in creating a

curved edge screen for users that would allow them to take advantage of the

S-Pen accessory as well as give them plenty of room to play around the display

with their fingers.



With careful precision, the dual curved edge came into being on a Galaxy Note 7

and its Super AMOLED QHD display is probably going to be the best display on

smartphones for 2016. The phablet does not come with 6GB of RAM as we were all

led to believe. The smartphone comes with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. A large amount of

RAM will definitely consume more battery life so it's a good thing that Samsung

kept its hand away for making upgrades that the average consumer would probably

not take advantage of.



With 4GB RAM and an abundant number of software improvements, we are certain

that the company could leap huge distances with its Galaxy Note 7 the same way

it has with its Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. There is a 3,500mAh battery

present, which is slightly smaller than the 3,600mAh capacity present in the

edge version of Galaxy S7, but it's still bigger than the cell present in Galaxy

Note 5. There isn't a dual rear camera present, but you still get the capable

12MP camera with an f/1.7 aperture.



Like its predecessors announced earlier this year, Galaxy Note 7 too is going to

be announced in two chipset versions: Exynos 8890 and Snapdragon 820. The actual

release date of the smartphone is going to be August 19, and it is speculated

that the unlocked price tag of the smartphone will range between the $849-$949

mark. We will be showcasing the different features present inside the 5.7-inch

smartphone shortly, so stay tuned for further updates coming your way shortly.
