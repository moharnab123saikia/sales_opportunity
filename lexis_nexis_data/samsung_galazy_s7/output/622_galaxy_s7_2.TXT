New Delhi, July 1 -- Samsung will sell unlocked versions of its flagship Galaxy

S7 phones in the U.S. so consumers can switch carriers more easily.



Although two-year service contracts are now rare, consumers are instead stuck

with two-year installment plans and cannot take a phone to a rival until it's

paid off.



Unlocked phones have no such restrictions. They are also free of

carrier-specific apps for messaging, video and other tasks, though Samsung still

adds several beyond the standard version of Android from Google.



Samsung's Galaxy S7 will sell for $670, and a model with a curved side screen

called Edge will go for $770. The prices are cheaper than Verizon, AT&#38;T and

T-Mobile, though more expensive than Sprint. You pay the phone's full price

rather than monthly installments.
