Here's the case for these Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge accessories



1. BRILLIANCE CASE-MATE How do you ensure Samsung's curvy, flagship phone stands

out? Fit it with a case paved with genuine crystals. The Case-Mate Brilliance is

covered in faceted stones that reflect light and it features a

champagne-coloured frame and matching button covers to set them off. It's not

just good looking, though. This cover comes in two parts, including a silicon

lining to provide impact resistance in the unlikely case the crystals slip from

your grip. The blinged-up accessory does add 50g and 3mm to the size of

Samsung's slender phone, but it will be worth it for those who want to be

noticed.

2. LENS COVER SAMSUNG Of all the cases, covers, and slips for Samsung's new

smartphones, this is the smartest. The Lens Cover, out this month, takes the

phone's camera to the next level, letting users attach a high-quality, metal and

glass lens for surprisingly crisp results. It's the first time Samsung has made

a phone lens but the company's photographic experience shines through. The

wide-angle addition we tested showed little distortion at the edges yet allowed

plenty of extra detail into the frame. The case itself features a soft lining,

and understated leather-like exterior, and even though the lens screws on in

just one turn, it remains securely in place. Macro lens next, please.

3. AEROSHIELD CYGNETT Australian firm Cygnett attempts to solve the Galaxy S7

Edge conundrum with this cover. Namely, how to keep its design on show while

protecting it from scratches and slips. The Aeroshield is a clear case,

available with coloured edges if you prefer, that hugs this phone's curves with

a polyurethane frame and polycarbonate shell to provide protection from drops.

It also features four raised corners on the back of the case to keep it in place

on a slippery surfaces. Its lack of weight and bulk is commendable, though this

cover does scratch quite easily.

4. EVO WALLET TECH21 This case can have your new phone completely surrounded.

The Tech21 creation not only hugs the rounded edges of the Galaxy S7 Edge with

impact-reducing FlexShock material, but it then covers it with a water-resisting

material to keep scratches off its screen. Inside the flip-up cover lies space

for a credit card for use as a real wallet, while a microfibre lining helps keep

its screen pristine. The case does weigh 30g and some may not like it covering

the phone's Always On display, but the Evo Wallet provides plenty of protection

when you just want to throw your phone into a bag.$60 / tech21.com
