Galaxy S7 Edge - the most anticipated smartphones of 2016, both the devices have
received an overwhelming response from the consumers. Samsung had also promised
a 'Free' Galaxy Gear VR with each confirmed pre-booking in Pakistan. Over the
past three days, Samsung stores were crowded with spirited buyers to pre-order
their favourite new galaxy devices.

The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have smashed many pre-order records. Internationally,
Samsung is expected to ship well over 17.2 million Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge
units within a month. In many countries, including Russia, the S7 Edge has
gained even more popularity than the Flat Galaxy S7.
