SECTION: Vol. 52 No. 71



LENGTH: 119  words





As Samsung Pakistan had recently begun the pre-booking for the Galaxy S7 and

Galaxy S7 Edge - the most anticipated smartphones of 2016, both the devices have

received an overwhelming response from the consumers. Samsung had also promised

a 'Free' Galaxy Gear VR with each confirmed pre-booking in Pakistan. Over the

past three days, Samsung stores were crowded with spirited buyers to pre-order

their favourite new galaxy devices.



The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have smashed many pre-order records. Internationally,

Samsung is expected to ship well over 17.2 million Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge

units within a month. In many countries, including Russia, the S7 Edge has

gained even more popularity than the Flat Galaxy S7.
