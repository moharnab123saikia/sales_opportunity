So, what sets HTC 10 apart from flagships like Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge

and LG G5? Siddiqui says the biggest innovation is the camera. "The company has

made huge strides on the camera front. Even the front camera in the phone comes

with an OIS, making it the world's first smartphone to offer it," Faisal says.

"In the past, our cameras have not been that great and that is why we have spent

a lot of time getting the camera right this time," he admits.



Audio, or the sound quality of HTC phones has always been one of its strengths.

Faisal says they have carried this legacy forward with the HTC 10, bringing in

the ability to optimise frequencies of right and left ear separately. "People

hear differently from the left ear vs right ear. When you put the headsets on,

you can actually tune the frequencies for the left and the right ear separately.

Plus, its high-resolution audio, which makes for an immense clarity," he

explains.
