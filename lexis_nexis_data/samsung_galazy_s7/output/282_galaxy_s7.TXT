

Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge is reported to have exploded in a man's pocket causing
severe burns to his right hand and leg in the United States.

This incident apparently happened on May 30, almost three months before the
infamous Galaxy Note7 made its debut.

California-based Daniel Ramirez, who is recovering from burns, has decided to
file a product liability law suit against Samsung, further adding woes to the
company, which is already reeling under the Galaxy Note7 battery explosion
fiasco.

It is said that Ramirez, who was working on a project in Ohio on the morning of
May 30, suddenly felt his phone making vibration with whistling sound in his
pocket. Startled by the sensation, he tried pulling the Galaxy S6 edge and saw
dark smoke emanating from it and unexpectedly, it exploded burning his right
hand fingers and right leg's thigh region.

As per the complaint document we have retrieved, Ramirez suffered second degree
burns to his right thumb and index finger, and also second and third degree
burns to his right upper leg.

As of now, there is no word whether the battery of the Galaxy S7 edge is made by
Samsung SDI, the very same company unit which manufactured cell for the Galaxy
Note7.

It remains to be seen, whether Samsung extends global recall for Galaxy S7 edge,
as well.
