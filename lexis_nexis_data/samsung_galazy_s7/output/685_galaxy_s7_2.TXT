VR made affordable for Samsung phone users

The latest version of the Samsung Gear VR virtual reality (VR) headset was

released in August, in conjunction with the launch of the company's Galaxy Note7

smartphone.



This is the second consumer edition of the headset, which uses a Samsung

smartphone to run VR programs and as a display.



The most obvious difference is that the body of the new Gear VR is black,

instead of white. This is not a purely aesthetic change, but a functional one as

well, as the darker colour reduces glare and provides a more immersive

experience.



The rest of the new headset is very similar to the old version. The back edges

of the Gear VR are still lined with soft foam padding over rubber, which ensures

a close but comfortable fit.



There is still a focus wheel on the top of the headset, and two head straps, one

going around the head and one over.



The weights of the headsets are also similar. The old one weighed 318g without a

smartphone, and the new one clocks in at 312g. Pair it with a Note7 (169g), and

this adds up to 481g - on par with the Oculus Rift (470g), and lighter than the

HTC Vive (555g).



The most obvious difference is that the body of the new Gear VR is black,

instead of white. This is not a purely aesthetic change, but a functional one as

well.



The field of view has widened, from 96 degrees to 101. While it does not feel

very different in practice, it is a nice upgrade.



The biggest functional change is the inclusion of USB-C connectivity, to cater

to Note7 phones.

However, those with older phones like a Galaxy S7 or S7 edge need not worry, as

the connector can be swopped out for a Micro-USB one.



This can be done by toggling a switch on the connector to the unlocked position,

then sliding it out towards you. After putting in the Micro-USB connector, users

can lock it into place by toggling the switch again.



The device is compatible with the Note7 and Note5, and all phones from the S6

and S7 series.



The trackpad on the right side of the headset has also been changed. In the

previous iteration, it was grooved in four directions with a raised circle in

the middle, so users could feel where their fingers were even when wearing the

headset.



Now, the trackpad is smooth, save for a small raised line in the middle, which

provides for a cleaner experience overall.



Samsung has added a new Home button above the trackpad, while retaining the Back

button from the last model.



The Back button is slightly more raised, so users will be able to distinguish

between the two by touch alone.



The headset still caters to phones of two sizes, such as the smaller S6 and the

larger Note7. There is a long, flat button at the base of the connector which

allows you to move the connector's position to fit either phone size.



The button is pretty stiff and difficult to press, and often, I found myself

using my fingernail to reach it.



This would not be much of an issue, except that the headset's cover now latches

onto the connector and only fits when the connector's position is set for a

larger phone.



Before, the cover clipped onto the sides of the headset, and could be used in

any position. This means that when I was using it with the smaller S7, I had to

keep moving the connector whenever I wanted to store or use the Gear VR. It was

a frustrating chore.



That said, the Gear VR is still definitely the most affordable and accessible

way to experience virtual reality for Samsung phone users, and at $148 is a

must-buy accessory for Samsung smartphone owners.
