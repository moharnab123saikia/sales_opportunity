Samsung India is selling smartphones for Re 1 as part of 'Make for India

Celebrations'. The buyers can pay the remaining amount in 10 EMIs, according to

the company's website. There are attractive discounts on several ofother

smartphones too. These include Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy A7, Galaxy A5

and Galaxy Grand Prime 4G.Other than smartphones, the company is also offering

deals on TVs, ACs, Refrigerators, washing machines and microwave.The world's

largest smartphone maker Samsung recently reported better-than-expected jump in

net profits, boosted by the successful early release of its new flagship Galaxy

S7. The company rolled out the latest version of its Galaxy S series, Galaxy S7

smartphone, in March.The strong Galaxy S7 performance came in the face of a

flattening global smartphone market that saw arch-rival Apple report its

first-ever drop in iPhone sales since launching the handset in 2007.According to

research firm IDC, the worldwide smartphone market saw its slowest growth in the

first quarter, growing just 0.2%. In India too, Samsung recently claimed that it

has overtaken Apple to top India's premium smartphone segment in the

January-March quarter.



Hong Kong-based shipment tracker Counterpoint Research's figures show thatin

January-March rose to 62% from 35% in the preceding quarter. Apple's share, in

contrast, fell to 37% from 55%. GfK, which tracks end-consumer sales in

50,000-plus population markets, had narrowly placedat the top in the

October-December quarter last year. However, its lead has widened substantially

and as per GfK estimates, the Korean company's market share in the January-March

quarter is 50% as opposed to Apple's 41%.
