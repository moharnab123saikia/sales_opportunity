its Galaxy S6 edge. Indian consumers have already reported receiving it. The new

software update package also adds edge screen features,, to the older S6

edge.Apart from 'Always-On' display and concierge service, the older S6 edge now

features same software functionalities found on the new S7 edge, which costs
