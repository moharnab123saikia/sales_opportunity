Earlier this week we reported on the Samsung S7 Active not performing as
expected on water resistance tests. Now Samsung has replied to the test.

Samsung recently released a press release stating the Galaxy S7 Active is in
fact IP68 certified and that the standard warranty still applies. Samsung had
issued the IP68 certification to Galaxy S7 Active as well as its siblings the S7
and S7 Edge, meaning the phone should be dust and water proof, able to survive
immersion in five feet of water for 30 minutes.

According to Consumer Reports, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Active units failed the
immersion tests, resulting in flickering screen and moisture inside, while the
standard S7 and S7 Edge passed the tests. According to Samsung's press release,
"The Galaxy S7 active passed rigorous tests to ensure IP68 certification for
water resistance.Samsung stands behind this water resistance certification, and
will replace any Galaxy S7 active under its standard limited warranty, should
water damage occur."

This hints that the S7 Active tested by Consumer Reports might have been faulty,
but lets not try to swim with the S7 Active devices for now.
