Apart from its flagship S7 and S7 Edge smartphones, Samsung is also known for

its mid-range lineup of smartphones. These include the Galaxy A series as well

as the Galaxy J series. While an official announcement is still to be made, the

press renders of the pending Samsung Galaxy J7 have now been leaked.



According to rumors, the Samsung J7 will come with a 5.5-inch HD Super AMOLED

display, a 1.7GHz Octa-Core Exynos 7870 SoC, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of on-board

storage, a 13-megapixel rear camera, a 5-megapixel front camera, and a 3,300 mAh

battery. MicroSD support is included, as is LTE network connectivity. It will

allegedly ship with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow as well. It will also have a metal

chassis, which is a major upgrade from last year's plastic body.



However, it should be noted that the press renders are specific to the China

markets, but if traditions are to be followed, it will be released in other

territories. With the phone already passing FCC inspections, it is quite likely

that it will be released soon. It is also expected to sell for under $300.
