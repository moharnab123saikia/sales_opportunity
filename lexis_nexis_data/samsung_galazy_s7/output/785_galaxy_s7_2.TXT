Apart from its flagship S7 and S7 Edge smartphones, Samsung is also known for
its mid-range lineup of smartphones. These include the Galaxy A series as well
as the Galaxy J series. While an official announcement is still to be made, the
press renders of the pending Samsung Galaxy J7 have now been leaked.

According to rumors, the Samsung J7 will come with a 5.5-inch HD Super AMOLED
display, a 1.7GHz Octa-Core Exynos 7870 SoC, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of on-board
storage, a 13-megapixel rear camera, a 5-megapixel front camera, and a 3,300 mAh
battery. MicroSD support is included, as is LTE network connectivity. It will
allegedly ship with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow as well. It will also have a metal
chassis, which is a major upgrade from last year's plastic body.

However, it should be noted that the press renders are specific to the China
markets, but if traditions are to be followed, it will be released in other
territories. With the phone already passing FCC inspections, it is quite likely
that it will be released soon. It is also expected to sell for under $300.
