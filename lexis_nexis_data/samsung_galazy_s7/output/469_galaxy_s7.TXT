The fight between Samsung Electronics and Apple in ndia is set to intensify,

with the Korean company planning to spend a record sum on marketing and

promotion for the new lagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge that will be unveiled next

week and its US rival drawing up a counter-strategy.



Samsung may invest ' . 100 crore on marketing its latest smartphones, which will

be launched in India around March 8 and go on sale from the third week of March

at prices that could match Apple's iPhone 6s models. It asked dealers to ensure

maximum mileage for the Samsung brand on shop floors, three senior ndustry

executives said. To take on Samsung, Apple told dealers hat it will have

additional consumer promotion and is considering reducing prices on some models.

The company lined up a counter-marketing budget of ' . 30-40 crore, the

executives said."This is the first time Apple is reacting to a flagship launch

from Samsung in India, signifying how important the Indian market s emerging for

both the smartphone giants," said one executive.



"While Samsung is tightening the trade, Apple has told us to expect something

big."



Samsung India has issued an advisory linking payments to dealers to the

visibility of its branding on store fronts and inside. It asked retailers to

ensure its brand billboard is the first one above the shop entrance and only its

brands be displayed on store walls.



Industry executives said Samsung may offer the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge at a

cheaper rate than the ' . 50,000-plus launch price for last year's flagship

Galaxy S6.



The company is looking at a price of about ' . 45,000 to compete with the iPhone

6s that's currently selling at ' 44,000-45,000. The Korean company has advised

dealers that any discounting will entail strict disciplinary action, including

blacklisting, since it does not want a price war on the new models, industry

executives said.



Apple distributors have started taking feedback from key trade partners in India

on the level of support that might be required to counter Samsung's new

launches.



Emails sent to Samsung India and Apple seeking comment did not elicit any

response till Thursday press time.
