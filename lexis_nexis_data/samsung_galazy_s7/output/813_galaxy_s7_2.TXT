{1} HTC ONE A9 If you like the design of an iPhone but prefer Google's Android

operating system, the A9 is a wise choice. It has a pristine 5in display and

13-megapixel camera. HTC's customisation of Android is excellent.



£357.45, amazon.co.uk {2} APPLE iPHONE 6S PLUS This is the biggest-screened

iPhone with a gorgeous, high-resolution, 5.5in display and impeccable

12-megapixel camera. It has amassive range of apps, excellent voice recognition

and 3D Touch, where you press harder for extra functions. From £619,

apple.com/uk {3} APPLE iPHONE SE The newest iPhone, has a 4in screen which feels

much more suited to smaller hands - and pockets. It's the lowest priced iPhone

ever, but still includes a blazing-fast processor, a 12-megapixel camera capable

of shooting 4K video, and more. From £359, apple.com/uk {4} LG G5 The G5 is

different to other smartphones: the base slides off so you can insert a new

battery or attach a grip for the 16-megapixel camera. It has an always-on screen

that shows the time even when it's sleeping (and uses barely any battery). £529,

amazon.co.uk {5} MICROSOFT LUMIA 950 This is like having a full computer on your

phone. It uses a version of Windows 10 so will be familiar (but very different

from Android or Apple). You can even connect it to a display, keyboard and mouse

via a display dock. There's a 20-megapixel camera and 5.2in screen.



£399.99, johnlewis.com {6} NEXTBIT ROBIN The Robin has 32GB of storage built in,

plus 100GB more in the cloud. When the phone gets full, it automatically

transfers stuff to the cloud. The refreshing design incorporates a good 5.2in

display and decent 13-megapixel camera. £277.20, nextbit.com {7} SAMSUNG GALAXY

S7 EDGE This has a dazzling design, fast processor, 12-megapixel camera and

strong battery life. The 5.5in screen is as big as the iPhone 6s Plus but feels

easier to hold. The best Android smartphone on the market.



£639.99, selfridges.com {8} HONOR 5X This has a slick aluminium build, excellent

5.5in display, 13-megapixel camera. and a second sim card slot to run two

numbers. Battery life's decent and there's a nippy processor. Excellent value.

£189.99, three.co.uk {9} SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 If you like the latest Galaxy but

prefer a smaller screen, choose the S7 with its 5.1in display. It packs the same

camera, performance and battery life as the S7 Edge into a more conventional

styling. Both will run Samsung Pay later this year. £606.55, amazon.co.uk {10}

SONY XPERIA Z5 PREMIUM Many phones shoot 4K video, but only this one, with its

exceptionally high-quality screen, can play it back in full resolution. There's

a powerful 23-megapixel camera and a discreet fingerprint sensor. £599.99,
