TECH giant Samsung Electronics said yesterday its second-quarter operating

profit likely rose 17.4 per cent from a year earlier, its highest in more than

two years as Galaxy S7 smartphone sales propelled mobile earnings.



The world's number one maker of smartphones and memory chips said in a

regulatory filing its April-June profit was likely 8.1 trillion won (Â£5.4

billion), better than the average forecast of 7.8 trillion won tipped by a

Thomson Reuters survey of 16 analysts. This was the highest since a 8.5 trillion

won profit in the first quarter of 2014.



"Firm Galaxy S7 sales and growth in sales of mid- to low-tier smartphones have

strengthened the mobile division's market power and profitability, underscoring

the recovery in the company's smartphone competitiveness," Eugene Investment &

Securities said in a report ahead of the earnings guidance.



Samsung will not disclose detailed results until late July.
