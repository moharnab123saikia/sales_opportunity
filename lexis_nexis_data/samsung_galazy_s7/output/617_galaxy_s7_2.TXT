Google's Eric Schmidt Has An iPhone!



LENGTH: 194  words





And he also says the Galaxy S7 is better



At Startup Fest in Amsterdam yesterday, CNBC reports, Eric Schmidt - CEO of

Google's parent company, Alphabet - confessed to having an iPhone 6s.



As CNET notes, it's hard to imagine Steve Jobs admitting to owning a Samsung

Galaxy. Even if he were to have bought one, which is even harder to imagine, we

might add.



But that's the thing: It's loftier to claim your products are the best and that

you don't want the competitor's products. It's smarter to claim that your

products are better while also saying you own a competitor's product.



You see, Schmidt didn't just say he has an iPhone: He said he also has a Samsung

Galaxy S7, and that it's better. "The Samsung S7 is better, has a better

battery. Are we clear?... And to those of you who are iPhone users, I'm right."



That's so much like Google and like Schmidt, and it's smarter: You can't say

your stuff is better if you don't use the other guy's products.



But then again, Schmidt was on the board of Apple at one time. He left because

he didn't like the conflict between Android and the iPhone.



It makes perfect sense, therefore, for Eric Schmidt to publicly compare the two.
