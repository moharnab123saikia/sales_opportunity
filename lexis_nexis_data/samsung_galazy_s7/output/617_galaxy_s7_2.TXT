

And he also says the Galaxy S7 is better

At Startup Fest in Amsterdam yesterday, CNBC reports, Eric Schmidt - CEO of
Google's parent company, Alphabet - confessed to having an iPhone 6s.

As CNET notes, it's hard to imagine Steve Jobs admitting to owning a Samsung
Galaxy. Even if he were to have bought one, which is even harder to imagine, we
might add.

But that's the thing: It's loftier to claim your products are the best and that
you don't want the competitor's products. It's smarter to claim that your
products are better while also saying you own a competitor's product.

You see, Schmidt didn't just say he has an iPhone: He said he also has a Samsung
Galaxy S7, and that it's better. "The Samsung S7 is better, has a better
battery. Are we clear?... And to those of you who are iPhone users, I'm right."

That's so much like Google and like Schmidt, and it's smarter: You can't say
your stuff is better if you don't use the other guy's products.

But then again, Schmidt was on the board of Apple at one time. He left because
he didn't like the conflict between Android and the iPhone.

It makes perfect sense, therefore, for Eric Schmidt to publicly compare the two.
