Rumors of the next iteration of the Samsung Note device are already making its
rounds. Apart from being called the Note 7 instead of the Note 6, this new
phablet might potentially have a curved screen as well.

Thanks to an alleged teaser for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, an image suggests
that Samsung will be skipping Note 6 and going straight for 7 to align with the
Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. More than just a similar name, there are also
chances that the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 might come with curved edges on both
sides on the front and the back of the device. This could also bring in new
possibilities for the S-Pen.

In terms of rumored specs, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 will feature a 5.8-inch
Super AMOLED screen, carrying a 1440 x 2560 QHD resolution. The Snapdragon 823
SoC is under the hood with a quad-core CPU, and the Adreno 530 GPU. 6GB of RAM
is on board, and the 12MP rear snapper found on the Galaxy S7 is used on the
handset. That camera comes with an f/1.7 aperture.

The new phablet might be introduced next month, and be available for purchase
soon.
