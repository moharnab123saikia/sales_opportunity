LENGTH: 189  words





Will the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 come with a curved screen as well?



Rumors of the next iteration of the Samsung Note device are already making its

rounds. Apart from being called the Note 7 instead of the Note 6, this new

phablet might potentially have a curved screen as well.



Thanks to an alleged teaser for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, an image suggests

that Samsung will be skipping Note 6 and going straight for 7 to align with the

Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. More than just a similar name, there are also

chances that the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 might come with curved edges on both

sides on the front and the back of the device. This could also bring in new

possibilities for the S-Pen.



In terms of rumored specs,Â the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 will feature a 5.8-inch

Super AMOLED screen, carrying a 1440 x 2560 QHD resolution. The Snapdragon 823

SoC is under the hood with a quad-core CPU, and the Adreno 530 GPU. 6GB of RAM

is on board, and the 12MP rear snapper found on the Galaxy S7 is used on the

handset. That camera comes with an f/1.7 aperture.



The new phablet might be introduced next month, and be available for purchase

soon.
