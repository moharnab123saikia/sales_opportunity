

Samsung appears to have revealed the announcement date for its new smartphone,
the Galaxy S7.

The company has sent out invitations to an announcement event called 'Unpacked',
which is due to take place on 21 February in Barcelona.

Just like they did last year, Samsung will be unveiling the S7 just ahead of the
Mobile World Congress, which this year runs from 22 to 25 February in the
Catalan capital.

As well as sending 'Unpacked' invites out to the press, Samsung posted a teaser
video to its YouTube channel in the early hours of 1 February, which shows a
mysterious black box and a man putting on a Gear VR headset, possibly suggesting
there could be a VR-related announcement at the event as well.

The unveiling of the new phone will naturally take centre stage, but some
additional new details about VR would make fans even happier.

The event takes place on Sunday 21 February, and begins at 6PM GMT. The whole
event will be streamed live from the Barcelona International Convention Centre
on Samsung's YouTube channel and press site.

We haven't got an official glance at the S7 yet, but all rumours suggest it'll
look fairly similar to the S6. A few upgrades to the internals are likely to
include a MicroSD slot, IP67 water and dust-proofing, and a beefed up battery
and processor to keep it running smoothly.

It'll also likely come in the regular, Edge and Edge+ models that we first saw
with the S6.
