Samsung Electronics East Africa have officially unveiled its flagship devices in

Kenya with the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge.

This is the first official launch of the devices in Africa, as the smartphone

maker up the rivalry with Huawei, which launched their high end device last

month.





Samsung and other high end smartphone makers are fighting the wave of cheap

arrivals from chinese manufacturers that have in the recent past threatened

sales in premium brands.

The devices will be retailing at Sh80,000 for the S7 and Sh85,000 for the S7

edge. The S7 comes fitted with a 5.1 inch screen while the s7 edge spots a 5.5

inch screen.

The devices which will be available for sale starting today were announced

during the Mobile World Congress 2016 in Barcelona last month, with those who

pre-ordered the device receiving a Galaxy Gear Virtual reality as part of the

package.Â  Pre-ordering kicked off after the launch.

"This year, pre-order was six times higher than that of the S6," said Jung Hyun

Park, vice president and managing director Samsung EA.

The S7 edge is cheaper by Sh5,000 compared to its predecessor the S6 edge which

was retailing at Sh90,000 during its launch in September last year.

It will be available in black, gold and silver and comes with a power bank and a

clear view cover with a two year warranty.

The device has additional features like the water proof and dust proof that was

not in the S6.
