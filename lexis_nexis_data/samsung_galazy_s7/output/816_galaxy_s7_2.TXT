Thai Samsung Electronics has offered a refund to Thai customers who ordered and

paid a deposit for its now discontinued Galaxy Note 7 phone, plus a "comfort"

gift.



Customers can choose to buy one of its other models at 10,000 baht for a Galaxy

S7, Galaxy S7 Edge or Galaxy Note 5, and get a set of headphones free.



Customers can also choose to cancel the order and receive a 2,000-baht cash

voucher.



The offer is valid from Oct 21 to Nov 31.



The announcement follows the global discontinuation of sales of the Galaxy Note

7 model, which has a problem with exploding batteries the company seems unable

to fix.
