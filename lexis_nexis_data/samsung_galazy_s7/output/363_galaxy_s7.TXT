According to reports, a number of high-end handsets are on sale at different

retailers this week. The handsets on sale include some of the premium devices

manufactured by bigwig device makers like Samsung and Motorola, among others.



Specifically speaking, some of the handsets which are on sale at retailers like

Amazon, eBay, and Best Buy include Samsung's newest Galaxy flagship smartphones

-- Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge -- as well as Motorola's Moto X Pure Edition,

and Huawei's Nexus 6P.



The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge handsets are being sold by eBay at a respective

price tag of $599 and $699. The models which are on sale at the retailer are

international variants of the two handsets. As such, they are powered by the

Exynos processor - and not the Snapdragon 820 processor - but they can work on

the LTE networks of AT&T and T-Mobile.



The Motorola Moto X Pure Edition can be purchased at a starting cost of $299,

for the 16GB model, from Motorola, Best Buy, and Amazon. At the mentioned cost,

the White and Bamboo versions of the handset can be directly purchased from

Amazon, or can be customized using the Moto Maker tool.



The Huawei Nexus 6P handset is available for purchase at a discounted cost

directly from Best Buy and Amazon. Best Buy is selling the handset - along with

a free Speck case - at a $50 markdown on its retail price, while Amazon has

listed the handset at nearly $75 off retail.
