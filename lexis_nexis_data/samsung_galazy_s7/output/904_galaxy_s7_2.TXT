phones, which were recalled last month following reports of overheating
batteries that pose a fire hazard. The lawsuit against both the U.S. and
Canadian divisions of Samsung was filed in Ontario Superior Court by London,
Ont.-based McKenzie Lake Lawyers, LLP. The claim alleges Samsung was negligent
because they knew or should have known that the devices could harm consumers.

The allegations have not been proven in court. The lawsuit, which was filed on
behalf of Canadian residents who bought the Note 7, seeks damages and a
declaration that the defendants' actions were false and misleading and
contravened the Consumer Protection Act and the Competition Act. The South
Korean electronics giant stopped making and selling the devices and advised
owners to turn them offand stop using them last month.

Samsung Electronics Canada Inc. says customers who return the phone can either
exchange it for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge, or receive a full refund.

Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. !@COPYRIGHT=Â© 2016
