Samsung faces lawsuit in Canada

A class-action lawsuit has been filed in Canada regarding Samsung Galaxy Note 7

phones, which were recalled last month following reports of overheating

batteries that pose a fire hazard. The lawsuit against both the U.S. and

Canadian divisions of Samsung was filed in Ontario Superior Court by London,

Ont.-based McKenzie Lake Lawyers, LLP. The claim alleges Samsung was negligent

because they knew or should have known that the devices could harm consumers.



The allegations have not been proven in court. The lawsuit, which was filed on

behalf of Canadian residents who bought the Note 7, seeks damages and a

declaration that the defendants' actions were false and misleading and

contravened the Consumer Protection Act and the Competition Act. The South

Korean electronics giant stopped making and selling the devices and advised

owners to turn them offand stop using them last month.



Samsung Electronics Canada Inc. says customers who return the phone can either

exchange it for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge, or receive a full refund.



Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. !@COPYRIGHT=Â© 2016
