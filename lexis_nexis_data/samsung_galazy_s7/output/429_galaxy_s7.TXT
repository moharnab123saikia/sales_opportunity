Samsung Electronics said Thursday its net profit advanced 13.55 percent on-year

to 5.25 trillion won ($4.56 billion) in the first quarter, on the back of brisk

sales of its latest flagship smartphones.



Sales gained 5.65 percent on-year to 49.7 trillion won, while operating profit

rose 11.65 percent to 6.67 trillion won, Samsung said in its regulatory filing.

The results were mostly in line with an earnings guidance released earlier this

month.



Samsung said its IT and mobile communications business posted an operating

profit of 3.89 trillion won, up 42 percent from a year earlier. The company

attributed the performance to the strong sales of the Galaxy S7 series, which

went on sale in March.



The tech firm has been suffering from the sluggish performance of its mobile

division, especially due to competition from Chinese rivals.



The company said the Galaxy S7 is gaining popularity around the globe, including

in North America and Europe.



The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge smartphones were first showcased at a trade

fair in Spain in February.



Samsung's chip business, which emerged as the firm's new main source of profit

for last year amid sagging smartphone sales, posted an operating profit of 2.63

trillion won, down 10 percent from the 2.93 trillion won posted a year earlier.
