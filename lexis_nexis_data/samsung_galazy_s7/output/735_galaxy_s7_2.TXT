SAMSUNG'S flagship Galaxy S7 smartphone is already paying off.



The South Korean firm expects a 10 per cent rise in sales for the first three

months to March of 6.6 trillion won (Â£3.9bn), ahead of analyst estimates of

around 5.5 trillion won.



Revenues were up four per cent to 49 trillion won for the same period compared

to last year. The company, which also makes TVs and other electronics, did not

break down the figures further. That failed to impress investors, however, as

Samsung shares closed down 1.25 per cent, indicating they may not see this bump

as a longterm turnaround to falling profits. "The biggest reason for the sharply

improved profitability is largely due to much lower marketing spending for the

mobile business. The big disparity between the earlier profit estimates and the

latest revisions stems entirely from the mobile business. The faster release

surely helped, but it's dubious whether the S7 can continue to surprise the

market in the longer run," Dongbu Securities analyst Yoo Eui Hyung said.



Demand for the S7 is "healthy", according to analysts. Sales are as much as 50

per cent higher in some markets, compared to last year's S6, according to

Counterpoint Research.
