Samsung Electronics has announced the newest additions to the Galaxy family of

products, Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. Created for today's consumer

lifestyle, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge lead the industry with a refined design,

more advanced camera, streamlined software functionality and unparalleled

connectivity to a galaxy of products, services, and experiences.



We believe in a world that is brighter, sharper, more convenient, and more fun.

We strive to deliver on that vision with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge by

marrying elegant design with functionality and providing a seamless mobile

experience, said DJ Koh, President of Mobile Communications Business, Samsung

Electronics. We empower consumers with technology to help them get more out of

life and will continue to push the frontier of what's possible.



Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge introduce the first Dual Pixel camera on a

smartphone, delivering brighter and sharper images, even in low light. Thanks to

the revolutionary Dual Pixel technology, brighter lens with wider aperture, and

bigger pixel, the camera has a faster shutter speed and a more accurate

autofocus even in low-light conditions. Motion Panorama, a new camera mode,

brings movement to traditional panoramic photos, giving the user a completely

immersive visual experience.
