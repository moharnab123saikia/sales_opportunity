Galaxy S7 are in for a treat as rumors say that it might be unveiled earlier
than expected. According to a report by Tech Insider, Samsung's next flagship
phone may be announced in January, which deviates from the company's usual
launching month. "Armnepress" reports the information citing The Christian Post.

Samsung's Galaxy S devices are usually launched in March or April. But in order
to ramp up competition with Apple in the high-end phone market, they will need
to make some changes to their calendar schedule. CNET also reported that the
South Korean tech giant had already finalized the design for the smartphone
before September ended. Right now, they are reportedly securing the components
they will need to start production.
