YEREVAN, OCTOBER 22, ARMENPRESS. Those who have been waiting for the Samsung

Galaxy S7 are in for a treat as rumors say that it might be unveiled earlier

than expected. According to a report by Tech Insider, Samsung's next flagship

phone may be announced in January, which deviates from the company's usual

launching month. "Armnepress" reports the information citing The Christian Post.



Samsung's Galaxy S devices are usually launched in March or April. But in order

to ramp up competition with Apple in the high-end phone market, they will need

to make some changes to their calendar schedule. CNET also reported that the

South Korean tech giant had already finalized the design for the smartphone

before September ended. Right now, they are reportedly securing the components

they will need to start production.
