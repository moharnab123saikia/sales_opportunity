LENGTH: 169  words





The Rose Gold inspired Pink Gold editions for the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the

Galaxy S7 Edge are here.



While the Apple iPhone has its Rose Gold Edition, Samsung has decided to follow

trends and come out with its own Pink Gold versions for the S7 and the S7 Edge.



This is the fifth color option launched for the flagship phones. In a statement

Samsung said that the new color is inspired by skin tone, and it is said to

incorporate a touch ofÂ gentleness, radiance and sophistication to the phone's

design. Samsung also said, "Pink Gold was chosen as it, like the other colors

available for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, is a natural color that provides a

sense of comfort. These hues glitter and shimmer as if illuminated from inside

their glass surfaces."



The new colors will go on sale today in South Korea, and will soon be available

in selected markets around the world. These markets are not yet specified, but

it is likely that most of them will be in Asia.
