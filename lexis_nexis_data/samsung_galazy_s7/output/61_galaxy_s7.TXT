According to a Phone Arena report, the battery of Samsung newest Galaxy flagship

handset - Galaxy S7, and its bigger Galaxy S7 Edge counterpart - is bigger than

that of its predecessor, but the battery life of the new models is comparatively

inferior to the previous ones.



Specifically, Phone Arena has pointed out that the 3000 mAh battery of the

Galaxy S7 model and the 3600 mAh battery of the Galaxy S7 Edge version are

substantially bigger than the 2550 mAh battery of the Galaxy S6 model and the

2600 mAh battery of the Galaxy S6 Edge variant.



However, despite their bigger battery, the new Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge

handsets - as per Phone Arena's findings - have an inferior battery life in

comparison to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge handsets.



The battery performance of the new Galaxy handsets vis-a-vis their predecessors

was determined by Phone Arena on the basis of the results of its proprietary

test. The strenuous custom battery test designed by Phone Arena showed how long

the new and the previous Galaxy handsets lasted on a single charge.



With the battery test having revealed that the battery life of Galaxy S7 is 6

hours and 37 minutes, while that of Galaxy S6 is 7 hours and14 minutes, Phone

Arena said in a recent blog post: "Considering the larger cell of the Galaxy S7,

it's a bit weird to see such a notable delta."
