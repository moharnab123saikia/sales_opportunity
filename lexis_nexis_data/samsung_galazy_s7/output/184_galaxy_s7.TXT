Samsung Electronics, a global leader in technology and consumer electronics, is

set to launch a mobile technology tour to reach out to all consumers in

different areas around the Kingdom at the end of May.





The tour which will be taking place across different cultures in the Kingdom,

will be giving the chance to people living at these locations to be exposed to

the new ecosystem created by Samsung.

The new ecosystem consists of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, which is

accessorized with the new Gear 360 camera that can take 360 degree videos in

high resolution and still images.

The videos can be played back by utilizing the ability of the Gear VR,

transcending phone users into virtual reality, allowing consumers to relive the

moment in an adventurous and unique way.

Ferri Zekisson, head of IT and mobile department at Samsung Electronics in Saudi

Arabia, said: "We believe in a world that is brighter, sharper, more convenient

and fun, as we are striving to deliver on that vision with the Galaxy S7 and

Galaxy S7 edge by marrying elegant design with sheer performance and providing a

seamless mobile experience. This tour is our way of thanking our loyal

customers, and giving them the chance to experience the outstanding ecosystem

Samsung created wherever they might be in the Kingdom."

The all new Galaxy S7 and S7 edge has many new features, including a front 5MP

and back 12MP camera and introduces the first dual pixel camera on a smart

phone, delivering brighter and sharper images, even in low light. It also gives

a longer battery time for the consumer so that the battery capacity is now

3000mAH for the Galaxy S7 and 3600mAH for the Galaxy S7 edge.

This campaign promises to reach out to selected Saudi cities.
