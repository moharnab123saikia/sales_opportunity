Samsung Electronics, a global leader in technology and consumer electronics, is
set to launch a mobile technology tour to reach out to all consumers in
different areas around the Kingdom at the end of May.


The tour which will be taking place across different cultures in the Kingdom,
will be giving the chance to people living at these locations to be exposed to
the new ecosystem created by Samsung.
The new ecosystem consists of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, which is
accessorized with the new Gear 360 camera that can take 360 degree videos in
high resolution and still images.
The videos can be played back by utilizing the ability of the Gear VR,
transcending phone users into virtual reality, allowing consumers to relive the
moment in an adventurous and unique way.
Ferri Zekisson, head of IT and mobile department at Samsung Electronics in Saudi
Arabia, said: "We believe in a world that is brighter, sharper, more convenient
and fun, as we are striving to deliver on that vision with the Galaxy S7 and
Galaxy S7 edge by marrying elegant design with sheer performance and providing a
seamless mobile experience. This tour is our way of thanking our loyal
customers, and giving them the chance to experience the outstanding ecosystem
Samsung created wherever they might be in the Kingdom."
The all new Galaxy S7 and S7 edge has many new features, including a front 5MP
and back 12MP camera and introduces the first dual pixel camera on a smart
phone, delivering brighter and sharper images, even in low light. It also gives
a longer battery time for the consumer so that the battery capacity is now
3000mAH for the Galaxy S7 and 3600mAH for the Galaxy S7 edge.
This campaign promises to reach out to selected Saudi cities.
