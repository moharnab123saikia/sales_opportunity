total cost of pulling its Galaxy Note7 smartphones off the market will be at
least £4.4 billion.

phone would cost the company about 3.5 trillion won (£2.5 billion) during the
current and forthcoming quarter.

Samsung had already cut its thirdquarter profit forecast by £1.9 billion earlier
this week, an amount that could wipe out its entire mobile business profit.

halting sales because of concerns over consumer safety, with faulty units
overheating and exploding due to a battery defect.

Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on flights.

In a safety message travellers and holidaymakers were also warned not to leave
the fire-risk phones switched on while in the air or to stow them in checked-in
luggage.

operating profit during the third quarter after the recall cost.
