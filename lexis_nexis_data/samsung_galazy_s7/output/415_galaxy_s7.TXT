HTC 10 will obviously get compared to Galaxy S7 and in the camera comparison

department, both devices perform equally



HTC 10 has been officially announced, and the very first thing that we will do

is compare one of its weapons to the competition. On this occasion, HTC has been

bragging about how impressive the camera is going to be and went as far as

labelling it as the UltraPixel 2. The 12MP sensor according to DxOMark was able

to score 88 points, which is in line with Galaxy S7 edge, and 1 point higher

than Galaxy S7, which scored 87 points.



According to the details of the tests, the camera of HTC 10 performs

terrifically, as stated by the following pros:



Image capture Very good details preservation in all conditions

However, while the device's camera performs beyond our expectations, you will

obviously encounter some drawbacks, which have been listed below:

center

the corners

Video capture Some residual motion in walking movements

improve the camera side of things. As for the different color models HTC 10 will

ship in four models: Carbon Grey, Glacier Silver, Topaz Gold, and Camellia Red,
