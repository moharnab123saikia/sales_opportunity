Transportation has deemed it too dangerous to fly. It has been exploding all
over the place. All that could have gone wrong for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7,
has! Finally, the South Korean tech giant had to permanently cease production
after the replacement phones started catching fire and exploding as well. It's

charge. In addition, the company says it will also ship an Oculus content
voucher to these customers, and offer One Time Screen Replacement on the new
phone.
