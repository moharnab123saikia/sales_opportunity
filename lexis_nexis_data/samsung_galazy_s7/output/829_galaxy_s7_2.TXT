NEW DELHI: South Korean smartphone maker Samsung has announced that it estimates

a negative impact of approximately mid-3 trillion won (which is approximately

$3.1 billion or Rs 21,000 crore) in operating profit from the fourth quarter of

2016 through the first quarter of 2017, due to the discontinuation of Galaxy

Note7 sales.



The company already allocated the expected direct cost from the discontinuation

of Galaxy Note7 sales in its third quarter earnings guidance revision announced

on Oct. 11, but expects the drop in revenue from the discontinued sales to

continue to have a negative impact on operating profit for the next two

quarters.



The negative impact is estimated in the mid-2 trillion won range for the fourth

quarter of 2016 and at approximately 1 trillion won for the first quarter of

2017.



The company is releasing these estimates to inform the market on the impact of

the Galaxy Note7 discontinuation.



Moving forward, Samsung Electronics plans to normalize its mobile business by

expanding sales of flagship models such as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge.



Additionally, the company will focus on enhancing product safety for consumers

by making significant changes in its quality assurance processes.
