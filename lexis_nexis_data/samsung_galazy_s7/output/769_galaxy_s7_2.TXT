Bigwig South Korean smartphone manufacturer Samsung has officially unveiled the

latest addition to its Note line of flagship handsets which are equipped with a

stylus and are largely aimed at power users.



The latest Note is called the Galaxy Note 7. It is the successor to the 2015

launched Galaxy Note 5; and indicates that Samsung has given Note 6 a miss. The

newly-announced Note 7 is an impressive handset, amalgamating the most

noteworthy features of Note 5 and the design and waterproofing of Galaxy S7 Edge

handset released earlier this year.



In officially announcing the new Galaxy Note 7 handset, Samsung said that the

handset, with a 5.5-inch screen, will be available for purchase from all the

four leading US wireless carriers - AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile - with

effect from August 19. The preorders for the handset opened on August 3.



Samsung also said that it plans to offer an unlocked version of the Galaxy Note

7 in the US at a later date.



The Galaxy Note 7 will be available in the US in three color options -- Black,

Silver, and Blue Coral -- with its pricing to commensurate with that of previous

Note handsets, but higher than that of Galaxy S7 Edge which costs approximately

$800.
