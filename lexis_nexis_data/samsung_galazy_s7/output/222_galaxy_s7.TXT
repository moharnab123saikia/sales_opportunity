The South Korean smartphone company is making every bit to please the loyalty of

its customers after the heat of Galaxy Note 7 explosions.



samsung's dream smartphone Galaxy Note 7 turned out to be a chunk of bad

experience after a number of units were reported to have exploded over a period

of time - some while charging and some while inside pockets. While the whole

world was baffled, Samsung didn't leave even a single chance to show its loyal

customers how much the company cares for them.



The company offered refunds to its Galaxy Note 7 users, exchanged Note 7 with

other premium smartphones like Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, and Note 5. We even received

a report stating that Samsung was present at a few airports to help flyers with

Galaxy Note 7 for an immediate solution, when the flight companies banned the

smartphone into the flight.



However, the recent reports claim that the company has introduced an upgrade

program where the Galaxy Note 7 users to exchange their smartphones to the

upcoming Galaxy S8 and Note 8 smartphones, that are expected to arrive next

year.



Adding on to this, Reuters recently reported that the new upgrade program is

currently rolled out for Galaxy Note 7 users in South Korea, which is the

company's home market. To apply for the upgrade program, customers will have to

trade in their Galaxy Note 7 device for either Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge. And,

when the company launches the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy Note 8, the users who have

applied for the upgrade program will just have to pay half the price of the

Galaxy S7 device. The last date to apply for this program is said to be Nov 30.



It is being said that the new upgrade program was the outcome of the

class-action lawsuit filed by 527 Galaxy Note 7 owners in South Korea against

the company. However, we still do not know whether this upgrade program will be

available in other markets as well.
