 With the Note 7, Samsung has skipped a number in its Note series - i.e. the

Note 6.

 Clarifying on this, Samsung had earlier reasoned saying, "First, the Galaxy

Note7 will complement our Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, and unify our product

portfolio. Second, the Galaxy Note7 will minimize confusion about the latest

mobile technology from Samsung, and provide full alignment with Galaxy S

smartphone."

 "Galaxy Note7 will help people do more in work, at home and everywhere in

between. We can't wait to tell you more about it," Samsung added.
