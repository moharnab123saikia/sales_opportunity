 Samsung Galaxy Note 7: Iris Scanner, S Pen and other features
 With the Note 7, Samsung has skipped a number in its Note series - i.e. the
Note 6.
 Clarifying on this, Samsung had earlier reasoned saying, "First, the Galaxy
Note7 will complement our Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, and unify our product
portfolio. Second, the Galaxy Note7 will minimize confusion about the latest
mobile technology from Samsung, and provide full alignment with Galaxy S
smartphone."
 "Galaxy Note7 will help people do more in work, at home and everywhere in
between. We can't wait to tell you more about it," Samsung added.
