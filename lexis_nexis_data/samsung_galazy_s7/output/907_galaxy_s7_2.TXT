Will Galaxy Note 7 debacle blow up Samsung's dominance in smartphone market?

Samsung killed Note 7. But the demise may have put massive dent on its chances

of continued dominance in the smartphone universe.



Following weeks of reports of exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phablets,

concerned parents are asking their kids, "You have a Samsung



phone na? Please be careful, beta.



They're exploding!" As if every Samsung mobile device has turned into a highly

unstable nuclear warhead with a fast degenerating plutonium core. Some people

are seeing phantom smoke come out of Samsung washing machines even. Airlines and

pilots are asking passengers



to turn off Note 7 devices, calling out the brand by name in a never-seen-before

move.



Last week, TechCrunch's John Biggs wondered, "Could this be the end of Samsung's

smartphone reign?" It can't get worse, right? And yet, over at Cnet, Chris

Matyszczyk made the unkindest comparison of all: "Samsung or Trump: Which brand

is in bigger trouble?" He wrote,



"When the mighty fall, they don't always know how to react. After all, they're

mighty. Falling is for lesser sorts. Yet the last couple of weeks have seen two

famous brands fall into disrepute by their own hands. Careless hands, small

hands."



Samsung's Note 7 debacle is being billed as one of the worst disasters in tech

history.



Analysts have calculated the total cost of a permanent end to its "combustible"

flagship product's sales and it doesn't look pretty. A cost of $17 billion never

does.



An unintentional roast



Before the first Note 7 turned into an explosive device, though, it was hailed

as the ultimate victory for the South Korean electronics giant. At launch, in

Samsung's home market, over 200,000 units were pre-ordered in 2 days. Every Note

7 review was a slap in the face of Apple fanboys and gals everywhere. Even now,

despite a steady stream of reports and pictures of cooked phablets, and Samsung

officially killing



the Note category, some users and loyalists refuse to give up their devices.

Reasons vary from its superior capabilities to replacement hassles. Sample this

from Josh Dickey, entertainment editor at Mashable (@JLDlite): "I am keeping my

Samsung Galazy (sic) Note 7. The ORIGINAL one."



Dickey's piece on why he won't abandon the "ticking time-bomb"- 'My Galaxy Note7

is still safer than my car. I 'm keeping it' - comes with



this disclaimer though; "Mashable does not condone keeping your Galaxy Note 7 ,

and in fact has recommended strongly against it. This viewpoint is the author's

alone, and his judgment is obviously questionable."



There's certainly no dearth of "shame on you for still using Note 7" messages.

Samsung's shame, now, users' must bear too. Power down or



bugger off, dear irresponsible user.



'Next is what'?



"Clearly this is an unprecedented (and unanticipated) incident," says Manu

Sharma, vice president, mobile business, Samsung India. "Despite that across the

world teams have worked together fast and efficiently to announce to the world

and take the bold decision to have this kind of recall worldwide and not launch

product in India.



The main thing that we did was tell consumers that we care about them and we

don't want them to have a device that undermines their safety.



That's the first message we passed on to consumers. The second thing we did was

apprise them of the situation and how Samsung was trying to find the root cause

of the problem. And then we announced that in the interest of consumer safety

the product and sale of Note 7 would be



stopped globally. While in India we decided to not sell it anyway until we were

absolutely sure we were giving a safe product to consumers."



Samsung's Sharma admits that lasting damage to the brand is a concern, and

gaining back consumer trust is top priority. "While Note category in India is

not that large. But for us it's very important that each and every consumer,

even people who don't own Note devices but some other Samsung device is

absolutely sure that Samsung would work in their best interest and build the

best products for them. We'll do everything possible to gain their trust, and

we'll come back with a very solid plan for them on the S7 and S7 Edge product."



Finding its edge



The one thing that could prove to be Samsung's saving grace Matyszczyk points to

in his piece on Samsung and Trump: "Samsung's debacle is out of character.

Trump's is totally Trump." A fact competition is quick to acknowledge. Shubhodip

Pal, COO, Yu Mobile (a subsidiary of Micromax), believes Samsung will do just

fine. He says the company acted as a brave and responsible multinational.

Besides, he suspects, most of the negative sentiment surrounding the brand at

the moment is perhaps led and aggravated by users who aren't Samsung fans to



begin with.



Karthik Srinivasan, National lead, Social@Ogilvy, however, is less hopeful about

Samsung's prospects. He believes, Samsung, ideally, ought to abandon its old

brands like Galaxy and Note. Because in the minds of users the association with

Galaxy Note 7's spectacular fall from 'the greatest phone on the planet' to

badly burnt toast might be a lasting one. A memory that will make consumers of

premium devices think twice before splurging Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 on a Samsung

phone.



But that looks unlikely since in a global company statement last week Samsung

said, "Moving forward, Samsung Electronics plans to normalize its mobile

business by expanding sales of f lagship models such as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy

S7 edge."



Srinivasan looks back at another large-scale recall from early 2007. Nokia, in a

fast-footed move, offered to replace 46 million faulty batteries. Though it did

nothing to change the brand's plummeting fortunes and eventual demise. (Nokia's

is not the most reassuring of tales, clearly.)



Furthermore, we mustn't dismiss social media's role in amplifying consumer

sentiment and, in this case, fear, within a short-span of time. 2007 was a

simpler time. Samsung, says Srinivasan, was too slow to act and gave users ample

fodder to exercise their comedic chops for weeks. Even the fireproof boxes

Samsung sent to Note 7 owners to safely pack the device have become the subject

of ridicule and satirical unboxing videos, usually reserved for unpacking new

purchases by proud owners. Despite Samsung's task forces' best efforts to

address every concern on social media and keep customers apprised of the

situation, the meme machine was relentless.



Adding insult to injury is Google and its current ad blitz for Pixel, a phone

competing directly with Samsung's S7 range and Note, and iPhone 7. Next to Pixel

advertisements in major Indian dailies are ads for its cheaper Chinese brethren,

Huawei's Honor. Google Pixel, iPhone, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Huawei, and others, are

well placed to offer hesitant Samsung users suitable alternatives. While

Samsung's marketing machine will have to work doubly hard over the next few

years to reassure old and new customers of its top-end hardware that its phones

won't explode in their pockets or while watching Daenerys Targaryen's

fire-breathing dragons roast human beings, mid-flight.



The bottom line is, in a post "Explodegate" world, Samsung's future looks

pixelated.
