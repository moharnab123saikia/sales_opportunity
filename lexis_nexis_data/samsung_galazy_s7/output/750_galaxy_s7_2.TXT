Will Note 7 debacle leave an ugly mark on Samsung?

All is not well for the world"s largest smartphone maker. Samsung continues to

face criticism as it works to call back millions of its latest flagship Galaxy

Note 7 smartphones after reports of batteries catching fire and exploding.



The Note 7 was supposed to be a victory lap for Samsung. It launched to rave

reviews, which looked particularly good while analysts and pundits cautioned

that Apple"s iPhones were going to be somewhat less spectacular this year.



Now the phone"s name has become synonymous with danger, prompting Samsung to

work with the US product safety watchdog, the Consumer Product Safety

Commission. The agency has advised people to stop using the phones.



Not only that, the Federal Aviation Administration"s recommendation that the

phones not be used or even powered on during flights means that at least a

million people are hearing a warning about the Galaxy Note 7, by name, on

flights each day.



With the unprecedented return of so many potentially defective smartphones comes

the question: How much of a brand blemish will a Note 7 recall be for the

company?



Even with the bad timing and the bad press, there shouldn"t be too much lasting

damage as long as Samsung continues to be responsive to consumers" problems,

said Robert Cuthbertson, vice president at the consulting firm Boston Retail

Partners.



Companies, he said, have overcome recalls before, noting that Tylenol - which

had to recall all of its pills in 1982 - and others have recovered from recalls

by acting quickly and doing everything to demonstrate that their customers come

first.



On Monday, for example, Samsung told South Korean media that it will now obtain

its batteries from China"s ATL - the same firm that is the main supplier of

iPhone batteries.



"Samsung is trying to rectify their situation and do their best to control their

damage and make sure it doesn"t happen again," Cuthbertson said. As long as

there are no further issues with the new phones, he said, Samsung should be able

to recover.



Samsung, which is the world"s largest smartphone maker, has battled for years

with Apple for dominance in the smartphone market. In the past five or so years,

the firm has tried to position itself as a premium smartphone maker with devices

that can rival the iPhone.



In the 2016 American Consumer Satisfaction Index telecommunications survey, the

Galaxy Note 5 actually beat the iPhone 6s Plus as the top-rated phone, showing

that Samsung had succeeded in at least some of its goals. And while a slowdown

in the smartphone market overall had hurt sales, Samsung announced last quarter

that it was in a great position for 2016, as sales of its Galaxy S7 and S7 edge

had sent the company"s profits to their highest point in two years.



Samsung is trying to rectify their situation and do their best to control their

damage and make sure it doesn"t happen again.



Cuthbertson doubts that Samsung will lose too many customers to rival Android

smartphone makers, as its products still have the unique features such as their

screens and software that made them sell in the first place. Cuthbertson also

said he doesn"t think Apple will benefit much from this controversy, because

many people choose Samsung primarily as an alternative to Apple.



"Samsung has positioned themselves as the anti-iPhone, and they have loyalists

to the Android platform. There are also definitely those with a loyalty to the

Galaxy in particular," Cuthbertson said.



Online surveys have shown that, certainly among Android fans, Samsung"s brand

loyalty hasn"t taken too much of a hit. Android Police, an Android-focused news

site, asked its readers and found that most of its respondents, 39 percent, said

their perception of Samsung hasn"t changed at all in light of the recall.



Analyst Peter Yu said in a note that signs so far signal the firm will be all

right, even with the cost of a recall that Samsung acknowledges will be

"heartbreaking."



"Telcos at least have purchased more Galaxy S7/S7 Edges to replace demand for

Note 7s rather than moving to other smartphone vendors. Hence, Samsung has

maintained its 3Q16 smartphone shipment guidance despite the expected impact on

Note 7 sales," Yu wrote in a note, obtained by CNBC.



Shares of the firm are already recovering, easing some of the $22 billion in

losses the company experienced immediately after reports of the explosions hit

the news. Samsung"s stock, traded on the exchange in Seoul, closed up 4.23

percent Tuesday; Wednesday was a trading holiday in Korea.
