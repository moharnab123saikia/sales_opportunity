Samsung says Canadians with Galaxy Note 7 smartphones can start returning the

devices today as part of a global safety recall following reports of overheating

batteries that pose a fire hazard.



Samsung Electronics Canada Inc. in Mississauga has advised consumers to return

the phones to the stores where they were bought.



Devices returned to retailers and carriers can be exchanged for a Galaxy S7 or

Galaxy S7 Edge phone, or customers can opt for a full refund for the recalled

Note 7 and specific accessories.



Samsung.com customers are being offered a refund upon receipt of the Galaxy Note

7. Samsung Canada says it will contact those who bought their smartphones

through Samsung.com about the return process.



The South Korean electronics giant said Tuesday it would stop making and selling

the Note 7s and advised owners to turn off and stop using the smartphones.
