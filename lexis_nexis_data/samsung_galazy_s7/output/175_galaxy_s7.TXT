Samsung S7, S7 Edge overtake Apple's iPhone



SECTION: Vol. 27 No. 205



LENGTH: 218  words





The flagship devices Galaxy S7 and S7-EDGE from the world's largest smartphone

manufacturer Samsung are sold in greater quantities than the Apple's iPhone 6S

and 6S-Plus during a three-month period ending in May. Almost 16 per cent of

customers preferred a Samsung Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7-Edge on Apple's iPhone 6S

and 6S-Plus and only 14.6 per cent people purchased an iPhone 6S or 6S-Plus

during this period. No doubt, it is a significant achievement for the South

Korean smartphone manufacturer.



Apple's iPhone 6S and 6S-Plus were released in September last year while the

Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7-EDGE were announced in March this year with exciting

and attractive Virtual Reality (VR) offer.



But, the bad news for Samsung is that Apple is still dominating the customer

satisfaction ranking. 88 per cent of Apple's customers stick to the iPhone and

don't change their brand. On the other hand, 86 per cent of Samsung's customers

intend to stay loyal. Fourteen per cent of the people who purchase Apple's

iPhone devices used Samsung previously. Only 5 per cent of the Samsung's sales

came from people switching away from Apple. The reason for this difference is

the fact that people get a lot of options available when they decide to change

Apple's iOS-based device with the Google's Android-based gadget.
