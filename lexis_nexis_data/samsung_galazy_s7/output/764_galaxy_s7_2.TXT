NEW DELHI: Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Note phablet will reportedly start at a

price of Euro 849 in Europe, roughly translating to around Rs 63,000. The device

is expected to be launched soon, and will reportedly feature a dual-edge

display. The form factor is expected to be the same as the existing Galaxy Note

5. According to SamMobile website , the device will have hardware specifications

identical to Samsung's current flagship duo - Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge.Other

online reports hint at a possibility of a Gear VR headset being launched with

USB Type-C connectivity.



One of the major reasons for Samsung to delay its move to USB Type-C ports for

its smartphones is the fact that its present Gear VR headset comes with a micro

USB port. However, there is no official confirmation regarding these yet.Samsung

is expected to name its upcoming Note flagship Galaxy Note 7, instead of Note 6.

This is probably because the company wants to bring the Note line-up in sync

with the Galaxy S series.Samsung Galaxy Note 7 will reportedly run Android 6.0.1

Marshmallow out-of-the-box and will likely feature a 5.7-inch QHD display of

1440x2560 pixel resolution.Galaxy Note 7 is also expected to come with an iris

scanner. This means that users will be able to unlock the phone by just looking

at it. Similar to fingerprint scanners, the iris scanner will require users to

first register their iris scans in order to be used.
