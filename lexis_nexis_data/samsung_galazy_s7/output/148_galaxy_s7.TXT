

It is the iPhone vs. Samsung season again, with both the company's new handsets
out; Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7. Today though the focus of the
debate is the smart phones' cameras.

Its common knowledge now, that Apple has been dominating the smart-phone camera
market; so it can easily be said that it is surprising to see Galaxy S7 come out
on top. This marks the first instance a company has dethroned iPhone in terms of
phone camera performance. Naturally, great expectations awaited this year's
iPhone release.

It is needless to state that there are certain features that the iPhone has and
the S7 does not.

The big feature that the new iPhone has is a telephoto lens, which is a first as
far as phone cameras are concerned, which produces amazing bokeh effects.

However, in a one on one showdown the iPhone could not keep up with the Galaxy
S7, reported Business Insider.

In bright daylight, both the phone produced good quality images, but the iPhone
tended to over-expose the skies if it detected a human face or the like to
compensate for the skin tone whereas the S7 does not. Having a telephoto lens
zoomed-in photos are a win for the iPhone but the Galaxy S7 take the win by
having better aperture (f/1.7) - whereas the iPhone's is f/1.8 - which would
greatly improve macro photography also.

As far as sharpness is concerned the differences between the two phones is bare
minimal.

Points go to the Galaxy S7 as far as the auto focus feature is concerned, as the
iPhone takes a lot of time processing, lags and is less precise. In addition,
the Galaxy S7 has a more dynamic range than the iPhone has to offer which means
more shadow detail ergo better nighttime shooting.

Therefore, the verdict goes in favor of Galaxy S7, which wins this bout.
