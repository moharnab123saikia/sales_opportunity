Samsung is one of the official sponsors of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and to

celebrate the same, the company has launched a limited edition variant of its

Galaxy S7 edge flagship. The Olympic Games limited edition has the exact same

design and hardware specifications as a regular Galaxy S7 edge . The only thing

different is the colour scheme. The limited edition has its key components

coloured in the five official colours of the Olympic rings, and the logo itself

is printed on the lower back panel.



The back panel has the camera module coloured in blue. Coming to the front, the

earpiece and home button are subtly coloured in yellow. The volume keys on the

left are done in green, whereas the power button on the right has a red colour.

Not just that, Samsung has also customized the UI and included wallpapers and

lockscreens matching the Rio 2016 theme in the phone. The phone also comes with

the Rio 2016 app pre-installed. The Olympic edition smartphone will go on sale

in select regions, including the US, Brazil, China, Germany and Korea starting

July 18. That said, there's no news about the price yet. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge

has a 5.5-inch curved edge Super Amoled display with 1440x2560 pixel resolution.

The screen is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. It is powered

by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor paired with 4GB of RAM. The phone offers

32GB/64GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 200GB via microSD

card. The phone sports a 12MP rear camera with LED flash and OIS, along with a

5MP front camera. Connectivity options include 4G, LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,

GPS and NFC. It is backed by a 3600mAh battery with fast charging support.
