

Samsung has launched its mobile payment service Samsung Pay in Spain. It's the
first European market to introduce the service, following the launches in US,
China, and South Korea.

The service will be supported by CaixaBank and imaginBank at launch, the company
said. It will also be available for Abanca and Banco Sabadell customers soon.

Samsung Pay only works on the Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 edge, Galaxy S6, S6 edge,
and S6 edge+. The Galaxy A5 2016 will also support the service Pay in the coming
weeks.

The South Korean company added that the service will be available at all stores
with contactless terminals throughout Spain and that a number of partnership
deals with leading businesses will be announced.

Samsung Pay Europe director Nathalie Oestmann said: "The Spanish market's
progressive approach to digital payments makes it a logical launch market for
Samsung Pay. We believe that the comprehensive support from telecom service
providers; networks and processors; and banks and merchants, will help to
accelerate mobile payments adoption across Spain."
