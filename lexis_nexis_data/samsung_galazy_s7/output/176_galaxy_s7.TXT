The innovative camera featured on Samsung's flagship duo - Galaxy S7 and S7-Edge

has won the 'Best Product Award' for 'European Smartphone Camera 2016-17',

presented at the prestigious ceremony of 'European Imaging  and  Sound

Association' (EISA) awards.



The President of Samsung Pakistan - Mr. J. H. Lee expressed that; 'It is

delightful to receive this prestigious European award and the remarkable

consumer-response to these high-performance devices around the world. These

products are created to be the front-runners in 'The Next Galaxy' offerings.'



He said this revolutionary camera is capable of an amazing performance in

practically every shooting environment. The Dual Pixel Sensor boasts 12

megapixels with extended size that speed up the process of auto-focusing, using

phase detection. The brighter f/1.7 lens captures more light and makes the

camera capable of highly detailed and beautiful pictures even in the dark.



President said that camera software of the Galaxy S7 / S7 was also provided with

a Pro mode for those occasions when manual settings are required for highly

creative and professional-looking photographs. Previously, such fascinating

technologies like The Motion Panorama, Hyper-lapse video mode, Selfie flash and

spotlight features were not available.



He urged that Samsung had shipped well over 17.2 million Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7

Edge units around the globe, within the first month after launch. In Pakistan,

both these products were also launched in March 2016.
