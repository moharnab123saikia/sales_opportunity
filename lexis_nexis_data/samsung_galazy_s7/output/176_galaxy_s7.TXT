has won the 'Best Product Award' for 'European Smartphone Camera 2016-17',
presented at the prestigious ceremony of 'European Imaging  and  Sound
Association' (EISA) awards.

The President of Samsung Pakistan - Mr. J. H. Lee expressed that; 'It is
delightful to receive this prestigious European award and the remarkable
consumer-response to these high-performance devices around the world. These
products are created to be the front-runners in 'The Next Galaxy' offerings.'

He said this revolutionary camera is capable of an amazing performance in
practically every shooting environment. The Dual Pixel Sensor boasts 12
megapixels with extended size that speed up the process of auto-focusing, using
phase detection. The brighter f/1.7 lens captures more light and makes the
camera capable of highly detailed and beautiful pictures even in the dark.

President said that camera software of the Galaxy S7 / S7 was also provided with
a Pro mode for those occasions when manual settings are required for highly
creative and professional-looking photographs. Previously, such fascinating
technologies like The Motion Panorama, Hyper-lapse video mode, Selfie flash and
spotlight features were not available.

He urged that Samsung had shipped well over 17.2 million Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7
Edge units around the globe, within the first month after launch. In Pakistan,
both these products were also launched in March 2016.
