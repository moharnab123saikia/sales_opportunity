Samsung on Thursday announced that its new flagship, the Galaxy Note7, a fully
made-in-India smartphone with a dual curved edge display, will go on sale from
September 2 at R59,900.

"We have a huge base of Galaxy Note users in India and we are going to harness
that. There is also a lot of interest in the new features and that will open up
new markets. With the S7 we now have a strong portfolio to address the market,"
Manu Sharma, vice president, mobile business, Samsung India told
IndianExpress.com.

Sharma said all Samsung devices are now manufactured in India, including the
Note7.

Samsung Galaxy Note7 is also the first Android flagship to feature an Iris
Scanner. Samsung says 70% mobile users doing banking transactions on their
device are concerned about personal information leak. "With Iris Scanner, we
have added another layer of security, which is more secure than the existing
fingerprint recognition technology," he said.

Samsung, which recently started offering its Galaxy devices in the enterprise
sector with Knox Security option, is pitching the Galaxy Note7 as the ultimate
productivity device. Samsung Galaxy Note7 comes with a Secure Folder option that
allows users to keep personal and private information separate and secure on
their device.

Samsung Galaxy Note7 is also the first smartphone to feature HDR mode and
natively offers option to reduce the resolution of the device. "We are doing
more than ever with our smartphone and with Note7, we have tried to make
smartphone less complicated and more user oriented," he added.

With Galaxy Note7 becoming similar to Galaxy S7 edge, Samsung is focusing
primarily on business users who will use its S Pen more as the common method of
interaction.
