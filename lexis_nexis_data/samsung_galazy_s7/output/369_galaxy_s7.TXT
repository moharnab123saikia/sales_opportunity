Galaxy S7 benchmarking leak ends up being slightly disappointing

Galaxy S7 is expected to be one terrific smartphone, being armed to the teeth

with chipsets like Snapdragon 820 and Exynos 8890 (remember, the smartphone is

going to be available to purchase in both chipset models) and we expect the

device to make its way towards the 2016 Mobile World Congress show, which is all

set to take place during February. Only now, were we able to come across the

leaked benchmarking scores of the smartphone through a popular performance

testing app called Geekbench.



The scores spotted on Geekbench give us the impression that the device is not

all that is cracked up to be, despite the fact that it features two of the

fastest mobile chipsets found in Android powered smartphones of 2016.

Regardless, given below are the scores so you be the judge if there has been a

huge leap in performance if you compare Galaxy S7 and its predecessors.



The details on the benchmarking sheet state that the eight cores running in the

chipset feature a frequency of 1.59GHz. However, in our previous announcement;

the one where Samsung was proud to announce its Exynos 8890, four cores will be

custom developed by Samsung, while the remaining cores will belong to ARM's

Cortex-A53, so it is not possible for the chipset to feature all eight of its

cores running at the same speed, particularly when these cores are a part of

ARM's big.LITTLE architecture. It is possible that these cores are just for

testing purposes, but we will keep you informed on that front in the near

future. As for the remaining specifications go, it appears that Galaxy S7 will

be running Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 and the company's custom TouchWiz interface

will be running on top of that.



Since Galaxy S7 is also going to sport a ton of new technologies, you should

rest assure that the unlocked model of the smartphone is definitely going to be

quite an expensive mobile computing device. We will obviously keep you informed

about this, and when MWC 2016 kicks off, we will be able to come across these

minute details as well.
