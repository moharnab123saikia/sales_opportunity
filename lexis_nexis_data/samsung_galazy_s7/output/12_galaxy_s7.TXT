The Samsung Galaxy S7 is one of the most hotly-anticipated smartphones of the

year, and the biggest announcement at this year's Mobile World Congress.



The Korean company has changed up the design for this year's phone and moved

into the premium territory enjoyed by Apple's iPhones.



That means if you want to get hold of one, you're going to have to dig deep.



The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge will go on sale in the UK tomorrow, featuring a new

water-resistant design, an SD card slot for expandable memory, and a big enough

battery to watch 13 hours of HD video on a single charge.



The S7 is available SIM-free, from a price of £569, while the S7 Edge price will

start at £639 for a SIM-free handset.



If you don't fancy buying the phone outright, then there are a number of

different tariffs available from the UK's major networks:



Tesco Mobile is stocking the Galaxy S7 and the S7 Edge. All the supermarket's

tariffs include 4G as standard.

across the country.



"Prices for the Samsung Galaxy S7 start at £34 a month for the 32GB version and

£38 per month for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge," Virgin Media said in a statement.
