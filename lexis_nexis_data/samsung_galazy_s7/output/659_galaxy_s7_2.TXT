Bigwig South Korean device manufacturer Samsung has recently launched its new

Galaxy flagship handsets -- Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge -- and rumors have now

started making rounds about the company's forthcoming device, the Galaxy Note 6

phablet.



The next-generation version of Samsung's Galaxy Note is believed to be another

Samsung flagship device to be launched by the company in 2016.



According to the rumors circulating online about the new Galaxy Note version,

the much-expected Galaxy Note 6 will likely replace its predecessor, Galaxy Note

5, as the latest addition to the Galaxy Note line in a few months.



It is speculated that the imminent Galaxy Note 6 phablet will come with a number

of noteworthy enhancements over the Galaxy Note 5, thanks largely to the fact

that the new Note phablet will boast some high-end specifications and features.



The rumors about the Galaxy Note 6 have revealed that the phablet will come with

a bigger 5.8-inch display with a QHD resolution; a Qualcomm Snapdragon or

Samsung Exynos processor; at least 4GB of RAM; a massive 4,000 mAh battery; and

a camera with laser autofocus and notably improved optical image stabilization

(OIS) and lenses. The phablet will likely run Android 'Marshmallow' at launch,

and will probably be upgraded to Android N later.
