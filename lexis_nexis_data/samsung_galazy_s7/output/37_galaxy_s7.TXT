South Korean giant Samsung seems to have accidentally spilled the beans on its

next Galaxy flagship, S7 edge. The smartphone, which is expected to launch in

the next few week, made a brief appearance on the company's developer website.



The listing spotted by 'galaxyclub.nl' shared details on how the curved edges of

Galaxy S7 edge's screen can be used. It also confirmed the name 'S7 Edge' for

the device and that the upgraded display functionality will be exclusive to the

Galaxy edge range.



However, the page did not confirm or reveal any other potential specs of the

phone.



Galaxy S7 edge is expected to release on the sidelines of Mobile World Congress

2016 to be held in Barcelona, Spain, from February 22 to 26.



According to earlier leaks, both Galaxy S7 and S7 edge will be IP68-rated, in

other words water and dust-resistant. There are also rumours that Galaxy S7 may

sport Exynos 8890 or Snapdragon 820 chipsets.



Samsung Galaxy S7 is likely to come in four variants: Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Plus,

Galaxy S7 edge, and Galaxy S7 edge Plus.
