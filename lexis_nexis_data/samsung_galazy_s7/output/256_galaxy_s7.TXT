Watch: How Samsung Galaxy S7's Concierge service works

Giving some extra value for customers of the premium devices in India, Samsung
is now adding a layer of concierge services in the My Galaxy app. Manu Sharma,
director mobile at Samsung India, said along with curated services, S7 customers
will get to jump the queue at around 400 service centres and will also have
pickup and drop facility with the option of getting a standby device if needed.
The concierge will be in the form of an on-call personal assistant powered by
Haptik, Inc available from 10am to 6pm every day along with a chat service with
longer timings.

The curated services will be deep linked in the My Galaxy app and will include
partners offering discounted cab, shopping, travel, recharge and local services
among others.

While these service add-ons will be limited to S7 customers now, Sharma said
they could be extended to users to Galaxy S6 and Note 5 soon.
