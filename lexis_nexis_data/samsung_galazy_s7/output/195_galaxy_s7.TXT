Galaxy S7: Leak reveals waterproofing, wireless charging



SECTION: SCI TECH



LENGTH: 250 words





A leaked video of Samsung's Galaxy S7 flagship smartphones - set for an official

launch at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on February 21 - shows

that the smartphone is waterproof and has a wireless charging feature.



Samsung's Indonesian arm appears to have shown off the Galaxy S7 almost a week

earlier than planned. An unlisted commercial posted to its YouTube channel shows

Indonesian archer Dellie Threesyadinda training while using the new phone, tech

website The Verge reported.



In the video, Threesyadinda is seen operating a smartphone similar in design to

the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, in a downpour, suggesting a return to waterproofing.

The phone is also seen being used with a wireless charging pad.



The smartphones are rumoured to have metal and glass design, but may come at the

sacrifice of power user features. The Galaxy S7 Edge may come with a larger

5.5-inch display (the regular S7 will remain at 5.1 inches).



Both the S7 and S7 Edge will likely retain the resolution of 1440x2560 as their

predecessors with Super AMOLED displays. Samsung is likely to again offer 32 GB

and 64 GB options for internal storage and may launch a 128 GB version.



VentureBeatreported in January that the S7 will include a 3,000mAh battery, up

from the S6's 2550 mAh and the S7 Edge may sport a 3600 mAh battery. It is also

rumoured that phones might see a "downgrade" in camera resolution but offer

f/1.7 aperture to perform even better in low light settings. MM
