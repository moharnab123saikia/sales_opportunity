Ferrari North America is recalling some 2016 California T convertibles because

the vehicles may have an improper fuel line connection that could increase the

risk of a fire. The cars carry a price tag of $231,000 and up. Ferrari notified

the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration that California T

convertibles made between Sept. 8 and Nov. 11 this year have a low-pressure fuel

line that may not connect properly to the fuel pump feed pipe. That could result

in a fuel leak in the vehicle's engine compartment, which may increase the risk

of smoke or a fire.
