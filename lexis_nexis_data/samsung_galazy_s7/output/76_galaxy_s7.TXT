In a recently released report, mobile phone site Phone Arena has revealed that

an exchanged Samsung Galaxy S7 handset of an employee of one of the four leading

US wireless carriers -- AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile -- has exploded.



According to the report, the owner of the exploded Galaxy S7 handset -- the

Galaxy S7 Edge model, to be specific -- had got the handset barely two weeks

back, after exchanging a potentially explosive Galaxy Note 7, which has been

discontinued by Samsung.



Reporting the explosion of the Galaxy S7 Edge handset, Phone Arena - which has

been briefed on the incident - said that the handset's owner revealed that while

the Galaxy Note 7 had not exploded, the Galaxy S7 Edge received in exchange for

the handset exploded after normal use. The nature of the explosion of Galaxy S7

Edge is still unknown.



The Galaxy S7 Edge owner's claim that the handset had exploded will evidently

come as a surprise because the device has been available for the past few months

and has not been widely panned as being potentially explosive.



Nonetheless, in the last couple of months, some of the owners of Galaxy S7

handsets have apparently complained about the device getting overheated and

catching fire.
