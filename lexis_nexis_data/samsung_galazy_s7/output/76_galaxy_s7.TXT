an exchanged Samsung Galaxy S7 handset of an employee of one of the four leading
US wireless carriers -- AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile -- has exploded.

According to the report, the owner of the exploded Galaxy S7 handset -- the
Galaxy S7 Edge model, to be specific -- had got the handset barely two weeks
back, after exchanging a potentially explosive Galaxy Note 7, which has been
discontinued by Samsung.

Reporting the explosion of the Galaxy S7 Edge handset, Phone Arena - which has
been briefed on the incident - said that the handset's owner revealed that while
the Galaxy Note 7 had not exploded, the Galaxy S7 Edge received in exchange for
the handset exploded after normal use. The nature of the explosion of Galaxy S7
Edge is still unknown.

The Galaxy S7 Edge owner's claim that the handset had exploded will evidently
come as a surprise because the device has been available for the past few months
and has not been widely panned as being potentially explosive.

Nonetheless, in the last couple of months, some of the owners of Galaxy S7
handsets have apparently complained about the device getting overheated and
catching fire.
