Samsung Gear VR: Virtual reality just got real

Technology can be bewildering at times. Imagine standing on top of the Eiffel

Tower in Paris and having a 360 degree aerial view of the entire city. Or, for

that matter, standing on one of the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge in San

Francisco and enjoying a splendid view of the blue ocean, or looking at the cars

crossing the suspension bridge. In real life, you might not be able to go up on

top of either of the towers, but virtual reality technology can let you enjoy

the viewing experience mentioned above. Put simply, it is like actually being

there.



Bringing this experience closer to the consumer is an innovative piece of

technology from the South Korean consumer electronics major, Samsung. It's

called the Samsung Gear VR which lets you enjoy a cinematic wide view, immersive

360 degree experience and realistic VR games. Put on the Gear VR, and you're

there in the moment. A crystal-clear AMOLED display, wide field of view, precise

head-tracking and low latency brings reality to the virtual. Just for a sample,

think of playing Temple Run in a 3D environment with all the exhilarating

running, jumping and sliding. Take my word, this Samsung headgear will redefine

mobile gaming.



The Samsung Gear VR (also referred to as Gear VR) is a head-mounted, virtual

reality device that provides an immersive experience for a wide range of users.

The South Korean firm developed the Gear VR with the virtual-reality startup

Oculus (now part of Facebook). It retails for R8,200 and works seamlessly with

Galaxy smartphones. It is compatible with Galaxy S7|S7 edge, Note5, S6, and S6

edge.



When you connect a mobile device to the Gear VR, you can enjoy 2D or 3D content

and play games by launching apps on the mobile device. At my end, I connected

the Gear VR to a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and also synced in a Bluetooth headset

for a good audio experience. But do not put on the Gear VR when you are wearing

glasses; that is a mistake I committed and felt disoriented.



You don't have to be a geek to do the entire setup; even an ordinary mobile

phone user can do it. At my end, I was up and running within minutes of

unpacking the box. The product box will come with Gear VR, head strap, main

strap and user manual. I must insist the manual to be a must-read in order to

enjoy the device to its fullest. The Gear VR does not require charging as it is

powered using the mobile device's battery. After placing the straps firmly to

make it a safe head-mounted contraption, remove the front cover and insert the

mobile device into the centre of the Gear VR and gently push the device holder

to the left until the phone locks into place.



To use the Gear VR, you must manually install the Gear VR software. When you

connect the mobile device to the Gear VR for the first time, the software

installation will start automatically. After that, just follow the instructions

and it is done. The default VR apps are automatically installed. Follow the

on-screen instructions to create an Oculus account. When the software is

installed, the Oculus Store app will appear on the Apps screen on the mobile

device.



The touchpad is located on the right side of the Gear VR. Use the touchpad to

select items or to control the Gear VR. The Oculus Home screen is the starting

point for accessing apps and features. You can launch or download VR apps on the

Oculus Home screen.



Let me talk about the actual usage of the device. The best place to start your

Gear VR experience is not with a game but with the 360 Photos and Oculus video

demos which give you a feel of what virtual



reality is all about; some of these really stand out. I particularly enjoyed the

San Francisco tour photos and you can



almost feel the cold weather.



Gaming is another treat to indulge on the Gear VR. I downloaded some of the

popular ones, such as Temple Run, Titans of Space, and the overall experience is

excellent. The visuals are great the action works out brilliantly in 3D. This

sort of immersive virtual reality is mind blowing .



Overall, Gear VR is an impressive piece of technology with awesome viewing

experience. So what are you waiting for, slot in the phone, stick on the headset

and you're into your virtual reality experience. Highly recommended.
