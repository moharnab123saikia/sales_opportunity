South Africa sets up Galaxy Note7 exchange kiosks at airports over ban on

flights



LENGTH: 254  words





Samsung South Africa is implementing an exchange programme with kiosks at major

local airports in an effort to support the global recall and banning of Galaxy

Note7 devices from flights, the South Korean company said on October 21.



Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 7 smartphone was banned on airplanes because it

was prone to catching fire.



As a precautionary measure, Samsung South Africa is setting up these exchange

kiosks at the departure points at OR Tambo, Cape Town and Durban international

airports, to help with the smooth exchange of affected devices.



Promoters at the kiosks will help all consumers with a Galaxy Note7 to quickly

replace their devices with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.



"Although the Galaxy Note7 has not been launched in South Africa, we are aware

that a small number of consumers managed to acquire a Note7 device by either

buying it overseas or through parallel imports," the company said in a

statement. "The safety of our customers and those passengers travelling by air

remains a priority for us and we would like to emphasise that this ban and

recall only affects the Galaxy Note7 device."



According to the statement, for customers' safety Samsung will ensure that their

personal data will be safely transferred to the new device when exchanging their

Galaxy Note7 for a Galaxy S7 Edge device.



"Customers who own or have a Galaxy Note7 in their possession will not be able

to board a plane if they have the device on them in person, in carry-on baggage

or in checked baggage," the statement noted.
