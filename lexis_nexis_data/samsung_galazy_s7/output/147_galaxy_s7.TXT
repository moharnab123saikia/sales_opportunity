

Samsung Electronics' latest high-end smartphone, the Galaxy S7, on Wednesday
earned the top rating by a leading U.S. magazine for its cameras and other
features.

"These new models aren't just Samsung's best smartphones, but, perhaps, the best
smartphones. And they now sit atop our ratings," said Consumer Reports.

The magazine cited features such as cameras, water resistance and processors as
the reason behind its favorable views.

"Our tests confirmed that the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge can handle immersion for up
to 30 minutes in 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water," it said. "The still images are
ultrasharp, and the camera did very well in low light."

Battery life lasted more than 24 hours of simulated talk time, more than twice
Apple's iPhone 6s, according to the magazine.

The Galaxy S7 edge, the Galaxy S7 offbeat version that is curved on both sides,
ranked second in the review, which was the first since the models went on sale
in South Korea two weeks ago.

Consumer Reports also said it has ranked the iPhone 6s seventh and LG's G4
fourth. The Galaxy S5 fell to second, the same rank as the S7 edge, ending two
years of dominance in the ratings.
