

With bigwig South Korean device maker Samsung set to launch its latest Galaxy
flagship handsets -- Galaxy S7; and Galaxy S7 Edge -- at the Mobile World
Congress 2016 in Barcelona, Spain, on February 21, analysts are projecting that
the new Galaxy handsets will be 'make or break' smartphones for the world's
leading smartphone manufacturer.

The forthcoming launch of the new Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge handset comes at
a time when Samsung is trying to retain its dominance in the samrtphone market,
especially in the wake of the increasing competition from other smartphone
vendors like Apple, LG, Huawei, and Xiaomi, among others.

Moreover, Samsung will also, more significantly, be battling itself with the
launch of its next-generation Galaxy handsets. Since Samsung has launched nearly
30 new smartphone models in the last one year, it would be a challenge for the
company to persuade customers to upgrade from their current Samsung handsets to
the new Galaxy models.

To convince millions of current Samsung users to purchase the new Galaxy
handsets, Samsung will evidently have to spend billions of dollars on its
marketing campaign for the new Galaxy S7 handsets.

Highlighting the fact that Galaxy S7 will mark a high-pressure handset launch
for Samsung, Ian Fogg -- chief of mobile analysis at research firm IHS
Technology -- told International Business Times: "Samsung is starting from a
leadership position in the smartphone market, which means that for the bulk of
consumers who are upgrading, Samsung is really competing with its previous- year
models."
