bill or an equivalent gift card.

After Samsung Electronics recalled Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to a flaw in
its battery, the company has now announced that it will offer its users an
exchange offer, where they can swap their Galaxy Note 7 with Galaxy S7 or S7
Edge in the coming week. In addition, affected customers will also receive a $25
credit on their phone bill or an equivalent gift card.

The recall came just over two weeks after the company launched the phone. It
follows reports of the 988,900 won ($885) phone igniting while charging.
"Samsung is taking a proactive approach to address customer needs around the
Note 7," Tim Baxter, president of Samsung Electronics America said in a
statement.

"To date (as of September 1) there have been 35 cases that have been reported
globally and we are currently conducting a thorough inspection with our
suppliers to identify possible affected batteries in the market," said Samsung
in a statement.

Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone next week and this can also hit
Samsung's business. Strategy Analytics said the combined cost of the recall and
lost sales would lop $5 billion off Samsung's smartphone revenue this year and
cut smartphone profit margin by 1.5 percent.

Samsung had launched its flagship device, Galaxy Note 7 in India in August and
was priced at Rs 59,900, but due to global complaints of exploding devices, the
sale has been delayed.
