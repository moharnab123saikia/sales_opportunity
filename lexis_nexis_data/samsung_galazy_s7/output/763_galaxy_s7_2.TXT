Right on the heels of the Samsung S6, S6 Edge and Note 5, Samsung is gearing up
to release the Samsung Galaxy S7, and the rumours have begun to spread.

Earlier rumours suggested that the S7 would come in a 5.2 inch or 5.8 inch
models, where the latter might have the curved Edge treatment. Recent rumours
suggest that the S7 might also have a feature similar to the Force Touch seen in
the latest iPhones from Apple. According to rumours from Weibo, Samsung has
allegedly tapped Synaptics to use its ClearForce technology, which will respond
differently depending on screen pressure. It would then provide contextual menu
options.

Apple was the first one to release this feature with its latest iPhones, but I
wasn't the first to announce it as Huawei announced a similar feature in early
September forÂ the Huawei Mate S. Samsung is known to follow and set trends for
smartphones as well, such as the heart rate sensors and fingerprint readers.
Pressure sensitive display can be expected soon from the company.

Other rumoured hardware include an Exynos 7422, Exynos 8890 or a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 processor, 3GB Ram, 20MP ISOCELL camera as well. It is expected
to be announced in January 2016.
