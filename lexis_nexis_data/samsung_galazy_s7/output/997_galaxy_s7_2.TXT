1. XPERIA EAR SONY Not unlike the movie Her, this smart Sony device sits in your

ear and tells you important information. After connecting to a smartphone with

NFC and Bluetooth, the Ear can give you the weather forecast and read you news

stories, read out SMS, Facebook, or WhatsApp messages as they arrive, and can

even deliver street-by-street navigation so you don't have to look at a phone

screen. The Xperia Ear comes with a dock in which it charges, and its battery is

designed to last a full day with 31/2 hours of talk time. It also features

sensors, including an accelerometer and gyroscope.

water-resistant Galaxy S5 are likely to be impressed with Samsung's smartphone

update, just in time for their new contract. The Galaxy S7 brings back water

resistance and strengthens it, with a better IP68 rating, allowing users to dunk

this phone in water for up to 30 minutes without consequence. The 5.1-inch phone

is 14g heavier than before, but it also offers a faster octa-core chip, an extra

gigabyte of RAM, a significantly larger battery and a redesigned camera that,

while it shrinks to 12 megapixels, promises almost instant autofocus and uses a

wide f1.7 aperture to make the best out of low-light situations.



$1149/ samsung.com.au 3. MATEBOOK HUAWEI Hybrid computers are growing in

popularity and this slender model from Huawei offers plenty of options to make

it feel like a laptop. MateBook sports a 12-inch screen, a metal body and a

10-hour battery life. It powers through tasks with a 3.1GHz Intel chip and up to

8GB RAM, and runs Windows 10 software. Unlike its rivals, the 640g, 6.9mm-thick

computer also features a fingerprint scanner on its side and a USB-C port for

charging. Accessories include the MatePen, a keyboard case with PU leather and

the MateDock that offers extra ports.



$US699-$US1599 / consumer.huawei.com 4. 360 CAM LG Some virtual reality content

will be homemade this year, with cameras such as this model from LG behind the

push. The 360 Cam is a stick-shaped camera with two 13-megapixel cameras on

either side. It's simple to use: Just hold it in the air, snap a photo or 2K

video and view it on a connected smartphone. Photos can be shared as a large

flat image or added to Google's Street View or YouTube360 as an interactive

image that captures the entire room.price TBA / lg.com.au
