Galaxy Note7 to cost Samsung at least £4.4bn

SAMSUNG has warned that the total cost of pulling its Galaxy Note7 smartphones

off the market will be at least £4.4 billion.



The South Korean firm said this week that the discontinuation of its flagship

phone would cost the company about 3.5 trillion won (£2.5 billion) during the

current and forthcoming quarter.



Samsung had already cut its third-quarter profit forecast by £1.9 billion

earlier this week, an amount that could wipe out its entire mobile business

profit.



Last week, Samsung scrapped its flagship Galaxy Note7 smartphone, a day after

halting sales because of concerns over consumer safety, with faulty units

overheating and exploding due to a battery defect.



Last week Ireland's aviation chiefs urged plane passengers not to use the Galaxy

Note 7 smartphones on flights.



In a safety message travellers and holidaymakers were also warned not to leave

the fire-risk phones switched on while in the air or to stow them in checked-in

luggage.



"The Irish Aviation Authority strongly advises passengers to power down and

refrain from charging these devices on board aircraft," it said.



But Samsung has enough cash to absorb the shock from the phone recall. The

company said it expects to generate 5.2 trillion won (£3.7 billion) in operating

profit during the third quarter after the recall cost.



Samsung added that it will make significant changes in its quality assurance

processes to enhance product safety for consumers.



The company said it will expand sales of two other smartphones released in

spring - the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge - quashing rumours that it may try to

release updated versions of those devices.
