Samsung Electronics India will take a potential revenue hit of about '420 crore

this quarter because of its decision to kill its marquee Galaxy Note7 phone

after it failed to fix the manufacturing flaw that was causing the device to

catch fire.



The Korean company had estimated that it will sell around 70,000 units of Note 7

during the quarter, while it had plans to give a stretch target of a lakh units

to its India sales team to take on Apple's new iPhones, said two people aware of

the development.



The Indian team has calculated and updated the potential revenue loss to its

headquarters after taking stock of the demise of Note 7.



Samsung India may also revive its earlier Note series flagship, Galaxy Note 5,

later this quarter to salvage



some of the losses and not leave the field entirely open for Apple's iPhone7 or

even the Google Pixel which is due to be launched later this week.



Samsung had recently discontinued Note 5 model to focus on the Note 7, one of

the persons said. Additional focus will be also given on the Galaxy S7 and S7

Edge models.



When contacted, a Samsung India spokesperson declined to comment on the sales

target.



He said Samsung India has a robust range of mobile phones across categories and

the company is headed for record sales of handsets in India this year. Globally,

Samsung has cut its operating profit guidance by 33% ($2.3 billion) for the last

three months because of the Note7 fiasco.



Analysts say the decision to scrap the device could end up costing up to

$17billion.



Samsung India was all ready to start manufacturing Note 7 in India in its



Noida plant with the aim of launching the device just ahead of Diwali, almost 45

days later than the originally scheduled launch which had gotten pushed back due

to safety worries.The company is now planning to offer the Galaxy S7 Edge to the

approximate 20,000 Note 7 pre-booked customers in India, or an option to return

their money . It will also relaunch the Note 5 at an aggressive price point.



Since the next flagship will be launched only around March 2017, Samsung India

is going to revive the Note 5 to rebuild it premium portfolio, since at the

moment Apple has a complete free-run,\x93 one of the persons quoted earlier

said.



Meanwhile, Apple has ensured there is enough supplies of its latest iPhone7 and

7Plus in the Indian market unlike earlier years when it had to grapple with

supply issues.



Retailers said the maximum demand has been for the pricier iPhone



7 Plus model which sells upwards of '72,000 due to additional features such as

dual camera and availability in the jet black colour.



\x93Apple has ensured availability of sufficient stocks since it wants to make

the most of Note 7's absence. In fact, iPhone supplies are still not steady in

tier II and III cities, but Apple will now beef up stock there as well.Around

40% of the sales is that of iPhone 7 Plus compared with 15-20% earlier for the

pricier variant,\x93 said the CEO of a leading cellphone retail store. However,

retailers say the recall of Note 7 has not dented Samsung's other smartphone

model sales in India as yet. The company had worked around the issue by

launching a newer model every 10-12 days and also ensuring that there was no

discount on its models during the just finished online discount sales.



Samsung Electronics Co cut its third-quarter operating profit by $2.3 billion

after ending production of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, the first

official indication of how much the crisis will cost South Korea's largest

company.



Profit is projected to be 5.2 trillion won ($4.63 billion) instead of 7.8

trillion won in the three months ended September, the company said in a

regulatory statement Wednesday.That effectively erases all the mobile business

profit that analysts had been projecting. Revenue will be 47 trillion won

instead of 49 trillion won.Samsung and Vice Chairman Jay Y Lee are struggling to

contain fallout from t he t roubled Note 7 phones, which were overheating and

catching fire even after a recall that was supposed to fix the problem. The

Suwon-based company said Tuesday it would kill this generation of the high-end

phone and then cut third-quarter guidance today, less than a week after it was

first issued.



\x93This is a huge cutback,\x93 said\xC2 Greg Roh, an analyst at H MC Investment

Securities Co. \x93It means Samsung has reflected not only the sales loss from

the shutdown but it also means it would bear the costs of the inventories of

Note 7s in the channel as well as the components they bought a few months

back.\x93



Wednesday's announcement is the first time the company has put a price on the

debacle, even if it is preliminary. Chung Chang Won, an analyst at Nomura

Holdings Inc,



estimated in a research note before the company's announcement the worst-case

scenario of Samsung terminating the Note 7 would cost the company about $5

billion in operating profit through 2017.



Samsung's shares have tanked this week as new fire reports emer g e d . T he s t

o ck h a s slumped 10 percent in the past three trading days, wiping $21 billion

from its market value.



\x93It's the biggest crisis for



Samsung Electronics,\x93 said Huh Nam Kwon, chief investment officer at

Shinyoung Asset Management, which held more than 300,000 shares in the company

according to filings compiled by Bloomberg. \x93It's not because of its physical

losses, but because the issue has been a blow to the brand. The company should

have been more cautious in responding to this case in the beginning.\x93



The debacle is testing Samsung's management and raising questions about whether

it needs stronger leadership. Lee Kun-hee, the family patriarch, remains

chairman even though he suffered a heart at tack more than two years ago and h a

sn't b e en back at the com



pany since. His son,



Jay Y., is heir apparent but he hasn't been able to take his father's title

because of Korean custom.
