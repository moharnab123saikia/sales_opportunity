SAMSUNG will let its smartphone users in China pay with just a swipe of their

mobile as it launches Samsung Pay in the country in a partnership with China

UnionPay.



Samsung follows Apple, which launched in China in February and counted three

million cards set up with Apple Pay within the first two days. Samsung Pay will

work on Samsung's Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, Galaxy S6 edge+ and Galaxy Note5

devices, with support for other models planned down the line.



Nine banks are already on board, with six further banks supporting Samsung Pay

in the future.



Both brands face competition in China from homegrown companies, with Alibaba's

Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay and TenPay, along with Baidu's mobile wallet

already firmly established. The value of mobile payment transactions surpassed

Â£261bn in the third quarter of 2015, according to iResearch.
