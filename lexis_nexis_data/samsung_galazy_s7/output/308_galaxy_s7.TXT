Galaxy S7 to drop mobile carriers' logo like iPhones: sources -



LENGTH: 181 words





Samsung Electronics Co.'s latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S7, may come

without mobile carriers' logos inscribed on the back, industry sources said

Tuesday, reflecting the firm's efforts to improve the aesthetics of its

smartphones.



According to the sources, the Galaxy S7 to be released in South Korea will not

come with mobile carriers' logo on the back, and also will delete "Samsung" from

the front of the phone above the screen.



Samsung Electronics' spokesperson declined to clarify whether the rumors are

true in South Korea as well as possible moves to extend this practice to the

global market.



Industry sources said there has been a growing need for a "clean" Galaxy

smartphone among Samsung fans, especially since main rival Apple Inc.'s iPhones

come without the brand name inscribed on it, except for the symbolic apple on

the back.



Samsung earlier said its latest metal-and-glass encased flagship devices will be

available for sale on March 11 in 60 countries around the globe. Preorders for

the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge will begin on March 4 in South Korea.
