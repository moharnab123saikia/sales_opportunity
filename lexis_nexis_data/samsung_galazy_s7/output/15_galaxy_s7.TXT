The Samsung Galaxy S7 was one of the biggest announcements of this year's Mobile

World Congress.



The Korean company has changed up the design for this year's phone and moved

into the premium territory enjoyed by Apple's iPhones.



That means if you want to get hold of one, you're going to have to dig deep.



The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge will go on sale in the UK tomorrow , featuring a new

water-resistant design, an SD card slot for expandable memory, and a big enough

battery to watch 13 hours of HD video on a single charge.



The S7 is available SIM-free, from a price of £569, while the S7 Edge price will

start at £639 for a SIM-free handset. A range of contract deals are available

from local operators.



If you don't fancy buying the phone outright, then there are a number of

different tariffs available from the UK's major networks:



Tesco Mobile is stocking the Galaxy S7 and the S7 Edge. All the supermarket's

tariffs include 4G as standard.



Here's a break-down of how Tesco Mobile's options stack up.



Virgin will be stocking both models and will pre-install its WiFi Buddy app on

the devices. That will give users the opportunity to access secure WiFi hotspots

across the country.



"Prices for the Samsung Galaxy S7 start at £34 a month for the 32GB version and

£38 per month for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge," Virgin Media said in a statement.



"Virgin Media customers can get the Samsung Galaxy S7 in both Black and Gold.

The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge will be available in Black."



Giffgaff will be stocking the S7 and the S7 Edge and making both available from

tomorrow. The network's prices are as follows.

Paying the phone off each month requires a £25 upfront phone deposit over 24

months.

in store now.



Here are the list of prices on various tariffs for both phones on Three's

network.



If you're on EE, you can also pre-order the Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge through

the company's website or in-store.



Here's how the network breaks down its pricing:

"Existing EE customers looking to upgrade to the same plans will receive 10GB of

Vodafone is not only stocking the S7 and S7 Edge but is also giving their

customers a chance to get hold of it early.



"Customers who pre-order before Sunday 6 March, 2016 will receive their device

on Tuesday 8 March, 2016 - 3 days earlier than the official launch," a

spokesperson told Mirror Online.



The rest of Vodafone's pricing is as follows:

Vodafone Red 10GB Bundle for £50 per month or £44 per month respectively.



"Both have an upfront cost of £29 and include unlimited texts, unlimited minutes
