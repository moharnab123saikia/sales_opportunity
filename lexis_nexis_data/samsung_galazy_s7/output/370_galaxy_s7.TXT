LENGTH: 199 words





[THE INVESTOR] Samsung Electronics announced on Oct. 24 that it would run a new

compensation program, dubbed Galaxy Upgrade, for the Galaxy Note 7 users who

have exchanged their handset with the Galaxy S7 or the S7 Edge.



Those who participate in the program will receive a 50-percent discount, in an

indirect manner, on their future purchase of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8.



Samsung said the participants would have to first pay 12-month installments of

the S7 or its curved-screen variant and return their phone to receive the Galaxy

S8 or Note 8.



The remaining 12-month installments will be covered by the tech firm.



Under the existing compensation program, the tech giant offers a

30,000-won-worth online voucher for all Note 7 users, who exchange their Note 7

device or get a refund, and a 70,000-won discount on their mobile bill when

exchanging their Note 7 with Samsung phones, including the S7 and Note 5.



"The details of the new compensation program will soon be announced after

discussions with mobile carriers," said a Samsung official, adding the program

will run by Nov. 30.



Other benefits include a 50-percent discount on repairs of a damaged display,

for two times.
