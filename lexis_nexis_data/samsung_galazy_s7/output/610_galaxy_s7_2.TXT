Bangladesh, Dec. 28 -- Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, the world's top smartphone

maker, plans an initial production run of about 5 million of its upcoming Galaxy

S7 smartphones, South Korea's Electronic Times reported on Monday, citing

unnamed sources.



The paper said Samsung is planning to launch two different versions of its new

flagship smartphone: a 5.2-inch flat-screen version, and a 5.5-inch,

curved-screen version that will be called the 'Galaxy S7 edge'. Samsung plans to

initially make 3.3 million of the flat-screen devices and around 1.6 million of

the curved-screen version, the report said, with plans to launch the handset in

February. A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
