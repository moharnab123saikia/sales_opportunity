LENGTH: 255  words





Galaxy Note 7 will feature 64GB of on-board storage and a variety of different

colors to choose from according to your liking



We knew from before that Galaxy Note 7 would feature a microSD card slot to

provide a feature that was sorely missing from a Galaxy Note 5, which itself was

a terrific flagship belonging to the year 2015, but not without its

shortcomings. The company plans to overcome these shortcomings with the

announcement of Galaxy Note 7, which is expected to take place during the month

of August. We currently have no information if the smartphone will be coming in

variety of different storage models, but according to the latest hardware leak,

the device will feature 64GB of on-board storage.



If that is not sufficient for users, then a storage card slot is a feature that

we will definitely be looking forward to, along with an option to insert two SIM

cards at once. Moreover, Galaxy Note 7 is expected to come in a total of three

color models, and those details have been provided

Galaxy Note 7 has also been rumored to come with a dual-camera, in order to stay

ahead of the competition. According to the leak, both cameras will be a 12.3MP

sensor present in Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. The phablet has also been

rumored to come with a 4,000mAh battery. After all, if you're going to spend

over $900 on a flagship smartphone, then every penny will count.
